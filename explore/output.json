The line was shorter than expected which should have been the first red flag. \\n\\nWhen we were up next to be seated the host came out to tell us they were no longer serving raw or chargrilled oysters. As we stood there scratching our heads we saw several people inside eating raw and chargrilled oysters. \\n\\nWe were seated and sure enough, they told us they weren't serving them. We ordered our food and it came out pretty quick. \\n\\nWhile we were waiting for our food, the guy working the oyster bar told us the manager decided to stop selling oysters so the employees could get out of there quicker since it's been a long day for them. They were also closing 2 hours earlier than their sign, Google, and their website said. \\n\\nThis was such a disappointing visit. We understand it was a holiday, but it's unacceptable to stop selling your namesake just to get your employees out earlier.

Lots of places in the area are good, but ACME has the best chargrilled flavor.   You taste the oyster, butter, and garlic as well.   Other places are a little heavy on the parm or garlic.

I ordered the fried shrimp Po-Boy with a cup of seafood gumbo, both were great! Their shrimp is lightly battered and seasoned with great taste.

Lacked depth of flavor (there were some other great oyster places we tried that were yummier) and mostly just salty. 2/10\\n\\nRaw oysters - these tasted just okay and were shucked kind of messily so I was spitting out pieces of shell and tasting grime. Standard horseradish sauce with two tiny pieces of lemon per platter. 4/10\\n\\nSeafood etouffee - pretty good (can't go wrong with tomato and cream) but salty. We added the fried crawfish, and the fried pieces were tiny and mostly batter. 6/10\\n\\nNew Orleans medley - sausage was kind of dry, seafood gumbo was really yummy as was the jambalaya, and the beans and rice had nice chunks of meat in it. Overall pretty good save for the sausage, but I again feel that there are better places to go for these dishes. 7/10\\n\\nSoup of the day - on 1/16/2022 it was corn and crab chowder. Was okay but still a little too salty for my taste. 5/10\\n\\nOverall this place is heavy on salt and grease and primarily relies on those two facets for taste. The staff are amazing and service is great. I think there are better places to go for oysters.\", 'date': '2022-01-17 08:54:49'}\n\n## TASK\n\nAnalyze temporal patterns in the reviews.\n\nThe reviews are sorted chronologically.
