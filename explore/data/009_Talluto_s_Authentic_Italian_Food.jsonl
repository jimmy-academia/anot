Some weekends I just come with a big cart and do all my grocery shopping for the week.  From meats, produce, eggs, pasta, there are so many great options.

My favorites are the Rosa (a blush sauce and a little sweeter than their vodka sauce), vodka, alfredo, and shallot.  The Alfredo I'm still not sure what kind of magic they do to not have the sauce separate when reheating, but it's really tasty.  My favorite is the creamy shallot sauce though.  This one is lick the spoon good.  They also have fresh cut pasta where you tell them the cut and they cut it as you wait a minute.

I needed some fresh pasta and a friend suggested that I visit Talluto's. The service was great and the pasta was AMAZING. I will never buy pasta out of the grocery store again.

It wasn't until I looked up the store that I realized that this gem had been sitting a block away from my house for idk how many yrs ...\n\nThe original shop in southwest is closed now...sucks because I would be their #1 customer, but I understand. (Shout out to the nasty breakfast food spot that replaced it...yea that was an upgrade for sure *sarcasm*). I guess I will have to make that trip down to the Italian market when I don't feel like making my own pasta, but as good as this pasta is, I don't mind at all. \n\n(I'm REALLY bummed about that original location closing though lol I just had this magical full circle moment like 5 min ago so the wounds are fresh)", "date": "2015-04-29 13:19:51", "user": {"name": "Beverly", "review_count": 22, "yelping_since": "2009-12-09 04:18:11", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.88, "fans": 0}}
