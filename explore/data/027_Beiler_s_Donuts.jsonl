There are multiple other locations (Lancaster and Reading Terminal) as well. Note that their hours have adjusted because of COVID and it's limited to takeout only.

There's a large variety to choose from but I find that lately a lot of the flavors that I like aren't available. I think it really depends on the time of day you go.
