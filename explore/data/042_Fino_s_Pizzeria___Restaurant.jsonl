DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE VEGAN!\n\nI have been vegan for about 1 year. I cannot compete with the owner's track record of nearly 30 years vegan, though. That is what makes this so confusing. Why would he sell pizza with real cheese claiming it is daiya?? \n\nFor those of you unaware, daiya is a plant-based cheese that is really high quality and tastes amazingly like real cheese. Though the taste is decieving, the appearance is not. It does not melt or brown. \n\nI have made my fair share pizza and mac n' cheese using daiya.., never, not once has the cheese browned like real cheese when it has been baked. Not when i've baked it 20 minutes, not when i've baked it for an hour. My boyfriend and I ordered our pizza, waited 20 minutes for it to cook, and then picked it up. \n\nWe sat down and began to eat. I looked down and realized that the cheese I was eating was stretching, and was crisped brown on the top. Plant based cheese does not brown or stretch, as it is not real cheese. I started to feel very nervous and scared I was going to get sick, since I have not eaten animal products for a long time. \n\nWe took it back inside, and asked the owner about it. He flat out lied to us and said they use daiya. That was absoultely not daiya. The fact he is vegan and is claiming to have vegan pizza there is flat out disgusting. Luckily, I am not allergic to dairy and felt pretty normal after the few bites I had. \n\nI am very upset that someone would do this... the owner is probably passing off real cheese as vegan to save money, since daiya is expensive, running around $6.00 a bag. \n\nI'm not even mad from a financial POV, what had happened was just disrespectful and confusing. This man is a total fraud. It is hard enough being vegan; not having many options to eat or  dine out, on top of being subject to ridicule from non-vegans... The fact that this was even an issue in a community of like-minded people who are supposed to be supporting each other is really hurtful.

When I contacted them regarding this matter they apologize and said they would credit me next time. That's fine, its just salad dressing. \n\nSo I placed and order for wings, salad dressing, root beer and fries this weekend. I ordered it through the application Grub Hub like I did the previous time and when the guy arrives, I decided to have him wait while I checked my food. They provided me with the wrong size and type of salad and once again my salad dressing was missing. I contacted the store via my cell phone and it was on speaker phone with the driver standing next to me. The lady apologize and said the would give me a credit. I told him that I'm sick of the credit thing. This is ridiculous. She spoke with the driver the asked to speak back with me. I checked the ticket he was holding and it had the number #79 on it as did the two bags it brought. Some how someone put another person order in  my bag. The lady tried to blame it on the driver but I told her it wasn't his fault because both bags and the ticket with my order on it was marked 79 so who ever bagged the food which I'm sure it WASN'T the driver didn't check to make sure the #79 was on the correct bag. Why play the blame game and try to blame the driver when it was your fault. I understand people make mistakes but when its consistent and you act like you don't care and a credit will fix it then I have a problem with that. I gave the driver a tip because I knew it wasn't his fault. It was the lady on the phone who takes the orders. \n\nAfter the driver left she called me to say my card was declined (oh i forgot to tell you that the driver was looking for payment). I explained to her just like i did the driver that I paid through grub hub with my credit card and I only transferred enough to cover my order because i know how companies make mistakes and over and double charge you then have you wait a week to get a refund. The girl goes oh let me check your right, you did pay. I'm thinking to myself you know I paid because you called me to tell me you were out of root beer and what i wanted instead so I told you orange. I also asked for you to pleas make sure my french dressing was in the bag because you forgot it last time. She promised me it would be.
