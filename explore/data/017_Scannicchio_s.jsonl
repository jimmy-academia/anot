We had a variety of appetizers. The stuffed artichoke was delicious! It was a large artichoke with a bread stuffing. You pull the leaves off and eat the stuffing. Just be sure not to eat the leaves like I did!  The eggplant tower had breaded eggplant, fresh mozzarella, and Jersey tomatoes. The salad had a variety of lettuces, olives, onions with a balsamic dressing. I would prefer dressing in the side as it was a little too drenched for me. The corn and crab soup was sooo good! It had fresh Jersey corn in a light broth with chunks of bran. It was nicely spiced.\nOn to the entrees! Portions are large. Most of my party needed to go bags. My spaghetti and clams was tasty with chopped clams, chopped tomatoes and clams in the shell. A little too much garlic but it is an Italian restaurant.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and tender. The ravioli were yummy. \nWe brought in a specialty birthday cake and were charged $1/slice for plating-a little excessive I believe.

Has some fancier dishes and preparation compared with Villa di Roma or Ralph's, but still falls firmly into Italian-American cuisine. Kind of similar to Ristorante Pesto in terms of cuisine type and about equally good; kind of a dying breed of restaurant in Philly. Probably the best for the Italian-American classics other than maybe Villa di Roma. Prep is a bit fancier here and a bit pricier, but both are good.
