The most recent time I dined at Vetri, my dining partner and I were blown away by the tortellini in seafood brodo (impossibly delicate and yet so flavorful!) and the roasted goat, which was, in the words of my partner, \"the single best bite I've ever had.\" Also, if it's on the menu, get the molten pistachio cake. It's incredible - possibly my favorite dessert ever.\n\nService is always impeccable and welcoming, from the moment the ma\u00eetre d' greets you to the friendly goodbyes as you walk out the door. A shoutout to Bobby - who described the goat dish so wonderfully, I think it made the dish taste even better - and Zeke, who were and have been memorably wonderful.\n\nWe spent over $300 on our meal for two, and it was worth that and more to see every bite bring an expression of wonderment and joy to my dining partner's face.

It's definitely not a large space, but they've made the most of it.  I didn't feel crowded at our table as there is plenty of space between tables so everyone has some privacy. But tables were close enough so we could see people's food as it was being brought out to their tables, which we enjoyed. Lighting was low, but not too low, the bathroom was exceptionally clean, the dishes and glasses all beautiful and charming. \n\nFood: They offer a structured menu from which you choose one option among many for each course. Every single thing I ordered was amazing! From the savory caramelized onion crepe with truffle, to the locally foraged mushroom ragu pasta, to the veal Milanese, to the pistachio cake with strawberry ice cream, every dish was exquisite.

The branzino was delicious and buttery. The chocolate polenta cake was literally the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten. \n\nThe only thing I wouldn't do again is the spinach gnocchi.

While wonderfully done, I just don't personally love spinach this much that I can skip all the other things that go into a gnocchi. \n\nThe last thing I wanted to say is that Vetri felt: cozy.

Funny how I haven't left a review for Vetri yet, even funnier that I waited for the End Times to do my review... But let's lean into it.\n\nMy wife and I have now been to many tasting menus. We make it a point to go to the best rated, fancy-pants-iest restaurants wherever we go. It's worth mentioning that whenever we go to one of these restaurants and they ask us where we are from and we answer that we are from Philly, the other restaurants always ask \"Oh, have you been to Vetri?\" We always answer (with pride) \"Yes. Twice!\"\n\nWell, thrice now. \n\nThe highlights, in no particular order, of this very special Covid-mas episode:\n\nThe pistachio cake was easily the best dessert I've ever had, ever. Considering it didn't include chocolate, peanut butter, or bacon, that's pretty damn impressive.\n\nThe wine pairings varied from \"nicely complimentary\" to \"perfectly paired\" to \"my expectations were shattered.\" Every course we were pleasantly surprised as there was always a break out pairing.\n\nFor a very cold, very plague-ridden time of year, they had such an amazing setup that last year I would have chosen it for a lovely Christmas-themed experience even in non-Covid times.\n\nThe experience tonight made me realize just how, for lack of a better term, \"advanced\" the cuisine at Vetri is. My palate grows, is educated, is elevated, every time I come here. The fact that the entire experience is limited to Italian dishes and Italian wines, without being constrained by Italian tropes was nothing short of amazing to me. It makes me feel incredibly fortunate to be able to appreciate it.\n\nTLDR: The question you should be asking yourself is not \"whether you should go to Vetri\", but rather \"can you afford to miss it this season\"?", "date": "2020-12-06 02:14:42", "user": {"name": "Jordan", "review_count": 72, "yelping_since": "2011-07-17 15:29:57", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.72, "fans": 0}}

I am glad that Philly opened up indoor dining when they did. I was able to make the trip to take my gf for her birthday dinner. This is definitely a special occasion kind of establishment. So save your pennies and go to Vetri when you want to splurge. I truly believe that if Michelin gave stars in Philadelphia, Vetri would be one of the frontrunners. For me the entire experience, start to finish, was 5 stars. We showed up about ten minutes early for our reservation and were given two aperol spritz to enjoy while we wait. We were called in shortly thereafter to be seated. \n\nAs we walked up the stairs to our table in the upstairs dining room we were greeted by any staff we encountered on the way. While this is without a doubt fine dining, there is no pretentiousness lingering in the air. You feel as though you are being welcomed into someones home. Our waiter, Bobby, just made sure the entire experience was well rounded. He was very welcoming, extremely knowledgeable, and attentive. Everything from ambiance, staff, music, etc, set the tone for an incredible dining experience. \n\nNow on to the good stuff (the food). I won't cover every single dish specifically, but I will touch upon my personal standouts, as I couldn't pick a definitive #1 (that's a good problem). The prosciutto and the maple smoked duck breast were the perfect way to get the jowls salivating lol. The sweetbreads dish was bomb. They still managed to hold on to a little of the crispiness while covered in that delicious cream sauce.  The pappardelle with rabbit bolognese is an unassuming dish that packs a very well balanced flavor explosion. The stuffed guinea hen (prosciutto and foie gras) was another amazing dish. We also had tenderloin tartare, lobster tagliolini, and eggplant Milanese. We opted for the wine pairing and it was definitely worth it. Every wine was great and paired well with each dish. Even the dessert wines (which I am not normally a fan of) were great!  For desserts we had the molten peanut butter cake with Concorde grape gelato and the coconut semifreddo. The play on peanut butter and jelly was great. It's what you wish every peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever ate tasted like. The sorbet that accompanies the semifreddo is the perfect refreshing palette cleanser to end the meal. Great meal (from the amuse bouche to the petit fours), great experience.

I've been meaning to give it a whirl for years, but life has blocked me out last-minute each time I've scheduled a reservation. And, ironically enough, the wake of the pandemic was finally my time. Indoor dining mid-COVID is a new challenge for restaurants and restaurant-goers, alike. Fortunately, Vetri did a phenomenal job of ensuring social distancing throughout our visit -- most notably, were separated from other tables by both plenty of room and by physical dividers.\n\nWalking up the stairs to Vetri's dining room felt like being welcomed into an old-school Italian home. A center island and espresso machine are on full display in the space, and the lime-green walls are highlighted by Victorian guardrails and wooden accents. The semblance of traditionality is sharply contrasted by a deep red blown-glass chandelier, while 50s music plays unobtrusively in the background.\n\nWe were welcomed with a complementary spritz, a summer crowd-pleaser with an orange liquor base and a slice of fresh fruit. As we browsed the menu, our server eagerly highlighted some of her favorites. We opted for the Beef Tenderloin Tartare, the Sweet Onion Crepe, the Swiss Chard Gnocchi, the Corn Anolini the Dry Aged Pork Loin, the Roasted Baby Goat (a $35 upcharge), the Chocolate Polenta Souffle, and the Panna Cotta with Poached Peaches and Raspberry Granita.\n\nTo kick off our meal, we were ushered a bowl of focaccia and whole-grain sourdough. The airy center of our bread was contrasted by a delicately charred crust, complemented by a salty butter. We then were offered an amouse-bouche: cucumber-zucchini gazpacho with a tempura squash blossom. Each bite tasted like summer, transporting me to childhood afternoons rolling down grassy hills.\n\nOn to our antipasti, the tartare sported a blast of acidity from the red onion and capers. Admittedly, I would have preferred the crisp of traditional toasts over the somewhat doughy gnocchi friti, but the dyanmic flavors were a strong win. Meanwhile, the crepe was magical--the condensed onions almost had a jam-like consistency and the smokiness of an open fire, bound by a rich pasty and truffle cream sauce. By transforming the essense of onion into something brand new, it's no wonder that this is one of the Vetri's classics after 2 decades.\n\nTo the pasta course, the gnocchi themselves were heavenly pillows, with a richness of butter and ricotta that gave way to the delicate flavor of the chard. Meanwhile, the anolini highlighted the sweetness of summer corn, echoing the sweetness and happiness of the best corncake of my childhood. This was doubled by the zing of salt from Osetra caviar. \n\nFor the entrees, the goat was the fancy rendition of a holiday roast: the polenta itself could stand its own, and the meat. (especially the crispy skin) was loaded with flavor from spices and flame alike. This was arguably the best dish I've had the pleasure to enjoy this year (and well worth the $35 supplement). On our other plate, the espresso reduction and the duo of honey nut squash were the standouts, adding a desserty dimension to an otherwise standard slice of meat.\n\nFinally to dessert, the souffle was masterfully cooked, the dynamic dark chocolate finding the ideal balance between dense and gooey, and complemented by a vanilla gelato and cocoa nibs. In contrast, the zing of the summertime fruits brought the lightness of the last days of summer to the panna cotta. Lastly, we were offered 2 flavorful final bites: a fruit-creme truffle and an almond cookie.\n\nAt $110 for the COVID 4-course tasting menu (a relative steal compared to the $165pp just a few months ago), Vetri undoubtedly is a meal fit for a special occasion. But just the goat alone is reason enough to splurge on the experience. While I wondered if I would be missing out on the full Vetri experience, I nonetheless and left feeling contently full (rather than overwhelmingly so). Most importantly, Vetri left me with a memorable experience, both in exciting new memories and in ones I haven't recalled in years.", "date": "2020-09-13 22:43:44", "user": {"name": "Austin", "review_count": 211, "yelping_since": "2016-12-30 22:23:33", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.08, "fans": 25}}

Wasn't it orgasmic?\" That's the type of place Vetri is. For those of you who've never had food that was so good it was orgasmic, I cannot describe that feeling to you. You have to experience it for yourself. The meal started with a wine spritzer, a plate of assaggi, and a crudit\u00e9. The highlight was the foie gras torchon on toast. Sandwiched in between the layers was a fruit marmalade. It was heavenly. Our next courses were bison tartare with black caviar and potato dumplings and hamachi crudo. I thought the foie gras was great. The tartare was orgasmic! Crazy good. I had to control my emotions. Our next courses were a prosciutto cotto and a vidalia onion tart. I had hunted a hog last year and had my fill of pork products for a long while. The prosciutto reignited my love for pork products. Such exquisite flavor with the nuts and peppers! We had five pasta dishes next and they were all very good to incredible. I felt like I was eating at Babbo! The spinach gnocchi has always been my favorite. Best gnocchi in Philly. The almond tortellini was outstanding. I'm allergic to almonds and I still ate it, because - fuck it - it was that good! By the way, if you are a true foodie, you'll work through your allergies... just like the time my throat was closing when I ate macadamia-encrusted opa and thoroughly enjoying it as if it were my last meal on earth! Our main courses of capretto (baby goat) with soft polenta and duck with chicories and 'nduja were especially satisfying. \"I encourage you to pick up the chop with your fingers,\" our server recommended. It was finger-licking good! Since it was my dinner companion's first time at Vetri, his meal was comprised of classics, such as the spinach gnocchi and the onion tart. A palate cleanser of grapefruit sorbet was refreshing. Our desserts were chocolate polenta cake and cheesecake. At the end of the meal, I was presented with a goodie bag with a package of petit fours, biscotti, and an autographed copy of the month's menu. As always, Vetri never fails to impress and remains one of my favorite restaurants. It's expensive, but totally worth it for the food, ambiance, and service. It's a complete restaurant experience.

However, this review is really 4.75 stars because one of our dishes was less than satisfactory which I will explain later.\n\nIt's a small spot with only 30 something seats. My husband and I were seated in one of the front windows which was a great table. Our service was excellent from start to finish- we were a little early to our reservation and the hostess gave us a complimentary aperol spritz to sip on while we waited. Eric was our server for the night and he was excellent- well versed on each dish and very attentive.\n\nI love a good tasting menu and the best part about Vetri's is that they give you the option to 'yes' or 'no' certain items- they let you see the menu and if there is something you MUST have or, on the contrary, something you do NOT want, you can let them know ahead of time. The other huge plus about Vetri's tasting is that not everyone at your table gets the same set of courses! That means that I, since I dined with my husband, was able to taste even more courses than I would have if we had all the same dishes. Here is a quick rundown for anyone visiting Vetri in the near future:\n1. starters included mozarella, the most delicious fennel crusted with parm, and an amazing pastrami foie gras. \n2. next up was the hamachi crudo and the bison tartare. Between the two, the bison was the outstanding dish and I could have kept eating it all night. The hamachi was great but the fish + citrus combo is not my favorite so I much preferred the tartare. \n3. the sweet onion crepe, diver scallops and prosciutto cotto were next, all of which were absolutely divine. However, the prosciutto was the clear winner to me and may have been my favorite dish of the entire night. \n4. next up was our first of two pasta courses. I loved that the first round was a small sampling of three of their dishes so as not to overwhelm or stuff you with pasta. We had two plump spinach gnocchis, two almond tortellinis with truffle sauce (this was one of my must-haves), and two ricotta raviolis. These three were equally stunning dishes.\n5. the second round of pasta were slightly larger servings, enough for a few bites each. We had the tajarin with mushrooms and the busiate with pork shank ragu. Of these two, I preferred the tajarin (i love a pasta with mushrooms) over the busiate, which I found to be a little bland and lacking in the vibrant flavors all of the preceding dishes had. Overall, however, I definitely preferred the first round of pasta dishes over the second.\n6. the next course was our 'secondi' which I had not paid much mind to when looking over the menu at the start of the meal so I had not given a preference. My husband received the capretto with polenta which was lightyears ahead of my dish although not my favorite of the night. I received the bollito misto which is my reason for the 0.25 star deduction... this dish was so underwhelming and disappointing I was left a little shocked that the same kitchen could turn out all the dishes mentioned above and this one. To be fair, I do not care for stews or crockpot dishes because, to me, the flavors all blend together into one taste which I hate. This is what the bollito misto tasted like since it is literally just meat and vegetables boiled together. I understand that this is probably a very traditional italian dish but there was nothing about this dish I liked. Even the accompaniments did not seem to go with the rest of the dish (the salsa verde, although good on its own, seemed especially out of place). \n7. Thankfully, dessert picked right back up where we left off at the pasta and all three dishes were fabulous. The lime posset was definitely the underdog here but still good. The hazelnut praline semifreddo and the pistachio flan were BEYOND... and I don't even know how to describe them so just trust me when I say you need to try these.\n\nOk, so now we get to the price. Yes, it's a pricey tasting menu but for $330, the cost of two people, we got to try 15 dishes, not including the starters, the vast majority of which were what I call 'mind-blowing' dishes (aka I cannot make this at home and I have NO idea how they made it taste so good). Vetri is a very high caliber restaurant and it is obvious why they have been around for over 20 years now. I like to think my very disappointing entree was a one-off since almost everything else was outstanding. I will definitely return.", "date": "2020-02-27 21:12:23", "user": {"name": "Courtney", "review_count": 215, "yelping_since": "2013-09-30 23:11:14", "elite": "2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.22, "fans": 12}}

I've wanted to experience it for the longest time, but the timing never worked out in my favor. I was smart and made a reservation a few months ago when I knew that I would be in town. I was also lucky enough to get a reservation for lunch which Mr. Vetri only offers on Friday.\n\nIt was a little tricky for me to find as it is located in a town house. The signage is low key and unassuming. Once I entered, it felt like I was in a friend's home. I was greeted by the host immediately and seated quickly. The dining room is small and intimate with just 11 tables. \n\nThe server came over quickly and went over the wine list making recommendations. I stuck to water as I did not want to dilute my taste buds. \n\nWhen the server returned with the water, he went over the days tasting menu in detail. He also pointed out their most famous dishes and made recommendations based on my personal preferences. \n\nThe prosciutto cotto, truffle onion crepe, swiss chard gnocchi, almond tortellini, baby pork chop and fluke fish were ordered.\n\nA basket was delivered with a variety of hot homemade breads. The breads were unreal. They were soft and flavorful. I was also given a plate of buffalo mozzarella, foie gras and something else that I can't remember. I love foie gras, so I was in heaven when it was placed down in front of me.\n\nEach dish flowed perfectly. I'd finish one and would receive the next one about 10 minutes later. The servers remained exceptionally attentive without being over bearing.\n\nThe almond tortellini was out of this world. It melted on the tongue. The flavors complimented one another. They are known for this dish, so make sure you get it!\n\nThe swiss chard gnocchi was fabulous. Just like the tortellini it melted in your mouth. I'm not a fan of gnocchi in general, but I would definitely get it here without hesitation.\n\nThe baby pork chop was succulent. It was cooked perfectly and melted in the mouth. The broccolini was saut\u00e9ed beautifully and it was flavorful.\n\nI didn't enjoy the truffle onion crepe. It was too bold for my liking.\n\nThe polenta souffl\u00e9 was awesome. It was sweet, but not too sweet. The home made gelato that accompanied it was outrageous. \n\nThe server than brought out a surprise plate of various sweet treats. They were all incredible and the presentation was gorgeous. \n\nAll in all the entire experience at Vetri was top notch. The service was perfect and the timing of each course being delivered was just right. The manager visited the table and while he was polite, he came off as stuffy.

When we arrived, our table wasn't ready, but they escorted us upstairs to a waiting area and offered a complimentary glass of Prosecco. At first, this was appreciated as a nice gesture. Unfortunately, we ended up having to wait at least a full 55 (!!) minutes past our reservation time before we were even seated. (Honestly, I believe it was actually even longer than that.) There were AT LEAST four other groups also waiting for at least 40 minutes or more throughout our entire wait as well.  Finally, after 40-45 minutes of waiting, we politely asked about the status and whether we could be seated soon and were told our \"table was being set now.\" It still took another 10-15 minutes (at least) to be seated. The staff apologized and one female hostess said they \"make up for it.\" Unfortunately, I wish we would have left instead of continuing to wait. \n\nI presumed they would comp at least something or a portion of our bill, but that unfortunately did not occur. I do appreciate that, after we were finally seated, the staff seemed to expedite our food. However, waiting that long last a reservation time is unreasonable for two very busy working professsionals.  Given that this is supposed to be a fine dining experience, I also expected more effort to make up for this long delay on their part.  As a result, I would not return- at least not on a week night - and would not recommend others dine here without an early reservation and plenty of time to wait.  Their food is very good, but I believe there are very comparable italian restaurants in Philly (for a more affordable cost as well) and others would not require waiting close to an hour, or more, past a reservation time.\n\nUnfortunately, the restaurant's decision to move all of the waiting parties upstairs and out of sight of the dining tables means that current diners do not see the several parties upstairs to be seated and thus feel no need to leave the table once they have finished dining. There were numerous groups lingering and oblivious to the many who were waiting.

The wait staff was superb, from the beginning to the end of the service, though I have to say service did start out slow - it took a while for us to get seated even though we had a reservation. And we didn't get menus for 15 minutes after we were seated. It definitely got better and picked up as the courses started flowing. Our server started us off with some predinner bites, which were pretty good. The standout was the foie gras on toast. As part of the predinner bites, we were also served local raw vegetables consisting of sliced carrots, radishes, etc, with a side of oddly looking balsamic jelly, which seemed inconsistent with the tasting menu and did not taste good. Other than that, everything was great. Our server was very friendly and went over the tasting menu with us. The tasting menu consists of 4 courses, with about 4-6 items under each course. Not all of the 21 food items would be served. Instead, our server explained that the menu should be treated as more of a guide, and the chefs would tailor the tasting experience to each table based on each guest's food preferences. The chefs sent out different dishes from each course for my husband and I so that we could taste as many different dishes on the menu. Of the 21 items, we had 14 of them, which was plenty. We shared and enjoyed everything, especially the pastas. They were definitely the BEST that I've ever had. Some favorites of the night were:\n- Bay scallops with caviar (Antipasti)\n- Sweetbread saltimbocca (Antipasti)\n- Prosciutto with brown butter, pepper and nuts (Antipasti ) \n- Cauliflower scapinocc (Pasta)\n- Busiate with pork shank ragu (Pasta)\n- Duck with chicories + 'nduja (Secondi)\n- Chocolate polenta souffl\u00e9 (Dolce)\nAlso, we probably got three different bread baskets throughout dinner. They were all very well made. The focaccia bread was the best though. It was super soft and spongey. After dessert, our server brought over post dinner treats including profiteroles, cake bites and chocolate! Yum!

I decided to gifted my husband with a dinner here for his birthday because I knows he is a fan of chef Marc Vetri. The real purpose was meeting him and I clearly requested it several times to make sure that the night we had dinner the chef would be there and that he would have stopped at the table. Whoever was on the phone, guaranteed that chef would have been there. We had dinner last night and the first disappointment was that after we got sit, we asked about chef Vetri and he wasn't there. We felt fooled because we could have rescheduled the dinner if only they mentioned it during the phone call that I recieved the day before to confirm the reservation. That changed my mood even my hysband told me that we can just have dinner, we would have had other occasions to meet him. Bad idea.\nThe dinner was a huge disappointment. \nWe started with they're tasting men\u00f9. \nThe madai crudo was underseasoned, completely flat like most of the dishes we were served that I will describe right now. I couldn't tell if the prosciutto cotto was just the better quality of an american ham or just didn't taste right because it was sliced too thick. It was very balanced tho, the flavours were ok. We had scallops, saltimbocca and the sweet onion cr\u00e9pe. Last one had a very good and intense onion flavor but was overpowering all the other ingredients, not very balanced. Overall appetizers were ok but there was no wow factor.\nProblems started with the pasta dishes. Probably my husband is very picky in terms of fresh pasta because in Italy he had a family business wich fresh pasta was the main thing.\nHe had the gnocchi. I would have called them \"gnudi\" (naked in italian. basically the classic ricotta and spinach raviolo stuffing without the pasta, typical of the Toscana region). That because the texture was very soft; gnocchi usually ar more hard and firm. But that is just an opinion. They were seasoned beautifully, very tasty with a nice topping of ricotta salata. They  were ruined by the puddle of completely unseasoned and broken brown butter they were submerged into, giving me a nasty greasy sensation on my lips. \nWe had other two stuffed pastas wich were crafted beautifully but were completely flat and underseasoned and leaving an unpleasant aftertaste of burned butter. In Italy we definetly don't eat all this butter.\nThan he had the tagliolini with mushrooms. That for him was the only good dish wich truly impressed him. Pasta was pure perfection, slightly undercooked (he comes from Abruzzo and he eats pasta like that) and even if he's not a big fan of mushrooms, he tought they were beautifully seasoned. A very simple dish but with a big impact. Too bad the only one.\nThe worse was the second course. \nHe had capretto. Quality of meat was high but it was very simplistic. Not bad but still no wow factor.\nI had the worse. I was served dry aged pork. We couldn't tell if it was raw, so he tried it and probably it was because it was inedible and impossible to bite, very gamey and hard. But the worst surprise when he tasted it was that the sauce was completely burned. This dish was really terrible, offensive for the price I paid and probably the worst I ever had in my life. We were forced to send it back. They substituted it with the duck. It was slightly under, skin wasn't crispy but soggy and the taste of blood was too intense. The dish came out really quickly so probably that was the reason. Sauce tasted like plain vinegar, it was very acidic. I felt unconfortable to also send it back so luckily it was paired with good nduja and i chugged it trying to cover up the awful taste. Very bad.\nTime for dessert.\nI was served a pistacchio flan wich didn't taste like pistacchio at all. Very flat. They gave us other two chocolate based desserts that tasted like nothing. We left them all, very disappointing.\nI wonder if they even taste the food before sending it out because almost everything was flat and underseasoned.\nI want to believe that the kitchen was in a very bad day, hope that is not the standard and I hope chef Vetri knows about that when he is absent.\nThe only reason I'm giving the one star it's because of the service. The dining assistant that we had was really professionals and attentive. He gave us a great service and he was always on point about our request. He brought us a taste of ana amzing wine to pair it worh the duck to apologize about the pprk dishes. I wish the wine list would be more clear, I wouldn't order a $35 wine by glasse but it worth it. \nOverall, I'm disappointed about that experience and mostly about the fact that I was so sure that the chef would stop by to our table so my husband could finally meet him.", "date": "2019-12-18 03:54:45", "user": {"name": "Giovanna", "review_count": 3, "yelping_since": "2016-09-16 13:06:31", "elite": "", "average_stars": 2.33, "fans": 0}}

Any argument I can come up with is half-baked and flimsy. This is a five-star experience from start to finish. Your night will be perfectly choreographed and it will feel like an art as much as a science. The service is impeccable, the food is outstanding and somehow it's been shimmying out with this excellence for years and years and years. It would be easy for a place like Vetri to become tired and caught caught flatfooted after so much time in the world, but it continues to dazzle and impress, even amidst the hype. Expect to be full as can be at the end of your dinner here. And expect to be treated like royalty -- even if you're the ultimate difficult patron, as I am. I'm seriously impressed -- hence the hyperbole oozing out of this intro. This is where to book your special occasion dinner. Old school vibes and modern technique come together at Vetri for a masterful performance, and you'll get a personalized menu at the end of the meal to remember it for all of eternity. \n\nCame here as a party of five on a Friday night at 9pm. It's an intimate space -- quite small, in a homey way. The vibes here will assure you that you'll be taken care of in a thoughtful, genuine way. Somehow upscale and cozy at the same time, you'll find dim lighting, antique fixtures and aromas for days. You 100% need to make a reservation -- the space is as small as it is popular. When you reserve, they'll ask about specific dietary preferences/restrictions, which they will confirm when you arrive. Very thorough.\n\nUpon sitting down, you will be greeted with a welcome cocktail (but do *not* forget your ID -- Pennsylvania liquor laws are far more stringent than most, and a few of us weren't thinking about it and didn't bring out wallets which stirred up some frustration but ultimately it all worked out...story for another day), a sparkling vermouth-based drink (wine/beer only here). There's a fabulous wine selection here, which I urge you to take advantage of is you can. That said, I actually would advise against the wine pairing -- while it seems obvious to opt for it at a place like this, it was a little much for me. By the end, I really didn't want it anymore, which was a shame. At the same time, the wine pairing could be worth it just for the sommelier. The gentleman who was helping us had comically extensive knowledge of each wine, which he shared in an animated and painstakingly thorough way. I don't think I retained any of the knowledge he was dropping, but the theatrics of it are hard to beat. \n\nThe most unique thing about Vetri is the way that they structure their tasting menu. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of it or not. It's not better or worse than what I'm used to, it's just different. Unlike all other tasting menus I've had to date, Vetri curates a unique menu for each party member as opposed to bringing everyone the same set list of dishes. Meaning all five of us has slightly different meals. For example: I have a gluten sensitivity and Vetri serves two pasta dishes as part of its menu, so they gave me the option of doing one pasta dish, one alternate (they ended up bringing me a mushroom dish that was bonkers good). My sister doesn't eat duck while I love it, so I got a juicy duck breast for my entree-type dish while she got steak. Little things like that. They will personalize as best as they can. \n\nI tend to find it onerous to detail each dish in a tasting menu, so I'll just give highlights and overall impressions. Start to finish, everything was delicious and well-paced. From the first array of bites in the beginning, we knew we were in for something special. The cheese was fluffy and perfect, the roasted cauliflower seasoned perfectly and super satisfying. \n\nOther highlights:\n-The onion tart. This is a staple here and for good reason. Impossibly rich and flavorful\n-The spinach gnocchi and almond tortellini were outstanding. I'm very sensitive to gluten so I didn't finish this part of the dinner, but my god, it was worth trying. I've never liked gnocchi -- even great gnocchi, usually I just don't jive with the consistency -- but this was special. \n-The prosciutto served family-style during the appetizer portion. They said its magic was simply due to being \"doused in oil and pickle juice\" but it must have been more than that. Like everything else, just incredibly flavorful and delicious\n-The octopus was cooked perfectly, paired with pork belly which was a treat. I've often seen octopus paired with chorizo, so this was some extra special luxury. \n\nThey will bringing you lots and lots and lots of bread (and it's already a pretty heavy tasting menu) so do yourselves a favor and save it to take home.
