Cheese is excellent, coming from \"the house of cheese\".  The blue cheese was both creamy and had these little crunchy ends to it which made me smile every time I took a bite.  The Parmesan was also fresh and really popped with flavor.\n\nAs for the meats, i'd never tried pate before Di Bruno Bros, but how delicious!  The prosciutto wrapping the blue cheese was some of the best things we'd eaten in Philly.  \n\nEverything we sampled was fresh, and even if you weren't sure about a cheese or a cured meat, they'd happily slice a little off for you to try, and try we did.

I didn't realize they had a store here (I usually would get it from the Giant supermarket). So I had to stop in. CHEESE AND YUMMY THINGS GALORE!! My favorite is their basic sharp provolone, but really I imagine you can't go wrong with anything from here.", "date": "2017-08-25 20:48:02", "user": {"name": "Dana", "review_count": 1107, "yelping_since": "2010-06-19 22:12:40", "elite": "2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.7, "fans": 117}}

There were only about 15 of us and it was just the right amount. Rocco and Dana were in charge our night and they both are amazing! Great personalities, knowledgeable and just cool people to enjoy an evening with. We were able to try tons of cheeses that they would pair as an appetizer or with a jam, etc. They told us what wine or beer goes best with it too while we drank of course. We could purchase whatever we wanted in the store but the Mike's Hot Honey is my favorite. I would definitely do an event like this again there!", "date": "2017-08-03 02:04:54", "user": {"name": "Lindsay", "review_count": 15, "yelping_since": "2014-05-19 04:43:25", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.53, "fans": 0}}
