We opted to wait and we're seated shortly after. While we waited for someone to take our order, about two more crowds walked in and were politely greeted immediately and told them someone would be with them in one minute. Right after, another group walked in and after being greeted, they were advised to have a seat and would be asked to show their cards when someone came to the table.\n\nMy partner and I immediately noticed a large difference in customer care between us and the groups following us; I'm not one to say this often but it definitely felt like it was because we're are people of color.\nWe decided not to eat there and didn't even bother to try their food based on their service.

So I was confused about what they had & ordered 2 berry smoothies if there wasn't any peanut butter or if they Couldn't take out the bananas & I asked if he could check with the kitchen first before anything & let us know & he made us pay for everything before we even tried any of what we ordered. We paid & tipped before any of our things came, while everyone else had the opportunity to pay once they were done their meal (there were 3 other tables in front of us that we watched this happen) We got our food & smoothies( we received one smoothie without any Nutella when I never asked for that ) didn't like the smoothies so we asked if they can just give us orange juice in exchange for one smoothie we didn't like, yet they still tried to charge us for one small $4 cup of orange juice. Our tabs total came up to $66 with the tip included & they couldn't give us a complimentary orange juice? I was about to pay for it with my card when my boyfriend tried to take my card because we were just going to leave a $5 bill for the orange juice. The server tried to snatch my card from his hand & I asked to speak to a manager & he insisted he was the manager. We said we weren't going to pay for the orange juice because that was terrible service as paying customers. He also said he was going to charge us for the orange juice anyways without our permission.
