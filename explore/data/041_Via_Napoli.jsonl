I went here almost every month for \"date night\" with my wife before we would go to movies and it was the best Italian food I had ever had. Nothing in Michigan came close to the authentic Italian food that they served. When relatives were in town from Michigan we took them here and they agreed, this place was amazing. This place was the best until they changed the menu. They used to serve fresh bread from their oven that was literally worth the trip itself, now they serve bread that you can pick up at shoprite. The menu has been downsized to such a miniscule variety of the same themed food that its redundant to even try new things here. It seems like the menu has been downsized to reduce costs but from the reviews here it seems like it has also reduced appeal. They had a \"build your own\" pasta menu that had more variety than their entire menu does now. The portions are smaller now, there are fewer choices now, the price has gone up, but the service remains decent. The staff is friendly but they went from serving \"grandma's house\" to chef boyarde. Go here if you have never had decent Italian food and you will have a somewhat pleasant experience. Don't go here if you went here 2 years ago and loved it, it will ruin your opinion of this place. I'm giving it 2 stars for the memories and the service (after all I have been here literally about 30 times). My wife grew up in philly, she can make me the food that they now serve here.

It also seemed like our waitress was uncomfortably pushing extras or add-ons like sausage or soup/salad, which aren't included in the meal, when we were ordering.\n\nThe portion of gnocchi I got was much smaller than it used to be (almost half the size!). The arrabbiata sauce wasn't even listed on the menu anymore, and when the dish came out, my gnocchi were dense and the sauce was overwhelmingly oily and not spicy at all. \n\nWhen we looked online, we saw the old menu was still posted, and they had RAISED THE PRICES for many items-- my gnocchi used to be $10.95 but is now $13.50 for half the portion. The pizza my boyfriend got was also no longer made with fresh mozzarella. While the service is okay, they've definitely lost our return business.

The one thing we all agreed on is WE WILL NEVER RETURN HERE AGAIN...THIS WAS OUR FAVORITE PLACE TO COME. Note it is the past tense.\n\nThe new menu and new recipes are terrible. Everything is excessively salty or has that out of the jar chemical taste. \n\nThis was a better than average place, but with the new menu/manager/owner the place is still pretty inside, but everything tastes of cutting costs.\n\nHere are the reviews from us\n\nThey previously served a fresh out of the oven bread with olive oil and parm cheese , it is now a COLD STALE BLAND probably mass produced , dare I call it bread that are now half slices.\n\nHere are a couple reviews from us of the main courses we had.\n\nThe \"grandma's house\"\nThe pasta was server in a puddle of water.\nThe big homemade meatball has been replaced with 2 little ones That taste like is came out of a bag frozen ones. The sausage was boiled then grilled (YUCK!)\nThe escarole was replaced with poorly cooked broccoli rabe.\n\nThe gnocchi was GRITTY like SAND.\n\nBoth Veal Parm that were ordered were excessively over cooked.\nInstead of baked cheese, a couple of cold cut slices were slapped on top with a splash of sauce, just like diner does, NOT LIKE FINE ITALIAN DINING As the store front signage promises.\n\nThe Veal tortellini was not good enough to feed to the dog.\nIt was so salty, it was disgusting. and not even close to what\ndescribed in the menu.\n\nThe \"baked ziti\" was more like boiled ziti slopped up in some sauce with a sprig on top. This seems to be the new theme here.\n\nWe skipped Dessert and Coffee to go somewhere else.\nWhen a meal experience is this awful, and the personnel\ncare so little to make it right, you have to know to cut your \nlosses and move on. And if they screwed this much up, \nthe rest will be two.\n\nThe pictures look nothing like what you will get now. They should be removed \n\nThe changes are just more then the menu, its the owners obviously do not care and are all about profit....Send out the SLOP, most won't complain mentality.\nThe one thing we all agree on is none of would even bring any of our EX's here, we just aren't cruel", "date": "2013-12-29 01:10:18", "user": {"name": "Michael", "review_count": 7, "yelping_since": "2013-11-01 23:53:26", "elite": "", "average_stars": 1.0, "fans": 1}}
