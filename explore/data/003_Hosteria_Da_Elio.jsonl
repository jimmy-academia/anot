The eggplant appetizer was the best thing of the night, but was very small, comparable to a square of lasagna.  The grilled calamari was good too, well done with a fresh little salad.  Neither of the appetizers were very good for sharing though. All of the dishes were well done.  My veil cantaloni was good, the blush sauce tasted wonderful.  The birthday girl got the gnocchi Gorgonzola, that was just too heavy, it needed to be cut with something, she couldn't finish the dish and ended up eating mostly off of my plate.  The veil saltanbucca got a thumbs up, but two of my friends got the shrimp and scallops, and while the flavor was nice, there were maybe two shrimp and one scallop on the whole plate.  \n\nTo summarize, ok food and services, I wouldn't recommend for a bigger group, and with all of the fantastic BYOBs in the area, I can't say I'll go back.", "date": "2014-09-08 15:56:27", "user": {"name": "Jessica", "review_count": 179, "yelping_since": "2012-02-22 16:09:09", "elite": "2014,2015,2016,2017,2018", "average_stars": 4.26, "fans": 21}}

Being Italian American it's possible I held the food to a higher standard having grown up eating most of the dishes on the menu but I doubt many people regardless of background would have been thrilled with my meal or experience.  \n\nFirst of all when we arrived the restaurant wasn't crowded but we were still sat at one of the most cramped tables I've ever seen and no coat check was offered.  In truth if it were my restaurant I don't think it would even occur to me to fit a table against the wall next to the hallway but I wasn't going to let that get me down it was a special night and I was still looking forward to my meal.\n\nAppetizers\n\nThere was a limited menu for New Years eve so I was unable to order the grilled octopus appetizer that I was really looking forward to.  Instead I ordered the soup of the day which was an 8 dollar bowl of bland and uninteresting lentil soup.  For 8 dollars they might want to look into a sausage and lentil option because I can't imagine anyone getting excited for the current version which is not dissimilar to a can of progresso. In addition to the lentil soup we also ordered the stuffed eggplant which was similar to one medium sized square of Eggplant lasagna again nothing to write home about.  The eggplant was over salted but it was almost a pleasant surprise in comparison to underseasoned lentil soup.\n\nMain Course\n\nMy girlfriend was so excited they had the sweet potato gnocchi on the menu this is one of her favorite dishes.  All I can say is it must have been an off night for the gnocchi because that was easily the worst gnocchi I've ever had.  It was so bland and the texture was so soft, it was kind of like eating gnocchi made from Elmer's glue absolutely terrible I have no idea what everyone is raving about.  I had the Veil Marsala which again was pretty bland.  The meat was nicely cooked but the sauce and pasta left loads to be desired.  \n\nDessert was a slice of chocolate ganache with whipped cream it was good but not the most creative dish \n\nI'd give this place 2 stars I wouldn't waste my time going back.

It certainly sounded like what we were hoping to find: a small local place with a unique feel that had good tortellini (it was my daughter's 10th birthday and that's one of her faves).\n\nSo I don't know. Maybe it's one of those places that has variable quality, that sometimes has a down night because the cook's girlfriend left him or bad weather made everyone perform poorly. If that's the case, the cook's girlfriend has been really really nice to him and the weather was great yesterday, so Hosteria da Elio really knocked it out of the park for us.\n\nThe front room here is very not impressive, but that's not what you should go for. When the weather is nice (and, to re-state my earlier... uh, statement, the weather was fantastically gorgeous last night), the back patio is the epitome of what you want a restaurant's outdoor dining area to be like. Beautiful plants, very serene, cozy, just fantastic. The wine was great, because of course it's BYOB and we had a very nice chardonnay and a cold Sierra Nevada. The service was great, not pushy or fast moving, but well paced for the evening.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the eggplant parmesan appetizer as well as a gorgonzola salad. Again, in comparison with some other reviews where people talked about not being able to find the eggplant in their eggplant parmesan, our experience could not have been more different. The eggplant was sliced amazingly thin, lightly breaded, then layered thickly into a two-inch thick chunk of meltingly tender delicious goodness. The best eggplant dish I've ever had except for one spicy eggplant dish I had at a now-defunct Chinese in Santa Cruz, CA.\n\nThe tortellini with white sauce was tortellini with white sauce, well executed with bits of prosciutto and really tasty fresh sweet peas, but not anywhere off the range, as it were. Which of course is just what a 10-year-old wants from her tortellini.\n\nMy wife had the sweet potato gnocchi, which was, hands down, the best gnocchi I've ever had. I should interject here, I've lived in Florida, San Francisco, and St. Louis, all of which have quality Italian food, and been to New York and Italy as well, so I've had lots of gnocchi, good gnocchi, and my wife's a huge fan. This stuff blew us both away. Absolutely fantastic. It melted in your mouth, no chewiness or elasticity at all, but full of flavor.\n\nFor my dinner, I had the veal cannelloni with blush sauce. I seldom eat veal (for the obvious reasons, but it's so tasty that I sometimes break down and have it), so when I do, I really want it to deliver. This cannelloni delivered. And how. I'm used to cannelloni basically being like a meatball wrapped in a crepe. That's OK: when done well, it's a very tasty meatball. But the minced or ground meat has usually solidified into a mostly coherent structure. Not in this one. The meat was very finely minced and mixed with herbs and fell apart once you took a bite of it. The blush sauce gave a nice bit of sweetness and acidity to the dish, but didn't overwhelm the subtle flavor of the filling.\n\nThe portions were perfect, with no left-overs to take home, but our bellies well sated. The price was good, mid-range basically. We did not try the cannoli as many suggested, since my daughter wanted to go out for an ice cream cone afterwards and she's the boss.\n\nWe probably won't be back in Philadelphia all that often but when we are I would definitely make this a can't-miss place on each trip.", "date": "2013-08-05 20:03:48", "user": {"name": "Rick", "review_count": 11, "yelping_since": "2010-09-19 14:45:36", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.5, "fans": 0}}

Elio will come to your table and go over the specials.  My husband loves the veal cannelloni - the blush sauce is amazing.  I enjoy their Caesar salad, which includes a nice garlic taste, just like good caesar dressing should!  And you have to save room for dessert.  Their cannoli are the best I have ever tasted.  And the tiramisu is delicious too.\nI will mention that the portions are a bit small, BUT they fit the price.  This is a very affordable place to dine.  It's BYOB, which just adds to the value and laid-back feel.\nDuring our last visit, my dish didn't have much eggplant in it.  I mentioned to the waiter that I wasn't sure if they forgot it... they were very  accommodating and brought me a HUGE portion of eggplant to make up for it.\nAgain, I like the cozy feel, like you're stopping by Elio's for a true taste of old school Italian.

I was worried it was going to be heavy since it came in a cream sauce, but it was the perfect portion and was seasoned and prepared perfectly!  I loved it so much that I continued to dunk my bread in the sauce long after the gnocchi was gone!!  My boyfriend had a shrimp and scallop pasta dish that he also enjoyed.  We finished the meal with Italian wedding cake, which was also divine!   \n\nWhen the bill came we were both pleasantly surprised by how cheap it was.  So overall, average starters and great main course and dessert at a cozy and relaxed BYOB for a cheap price!  We will be returning soon!", "date": "2011-02-24 16:40:51", "user": {"name": "Meredith", "review_count": 37, "yelping_since": "2010-10-25 18:35:57", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.9, "fans": 1}}

I think I lost my hearing over dinner!  Don't come here unless it is empty.  I was excited about my first trip to this Italian BYOB but it was a lame experience. Service was from an old Italian dude but he sucked.  Absolutely no interest in serving my table, checking on water, he delivered dirty utensils I sent back, and was generally apathetic. Sir, please find your passion and pursue it. It is obviously not in the food service industry. \n\nFood was ok to bland.

We had a private party of about 25 and we had the entire outdoor patio to ourselves and enjoyed a 5 course prix fixe meal!

My friend supplied the many bottles of red wine (it's a BYO) and the entire meal/experience is one I will never forget. The owner came out several times to check on us and he was super nice.

We live in the neighborhood and have eaten at every BYO in the area. After two tries with Hosteria Da Elio we've decided it's just not worth it. There's just a weird lack of professionalism and a slight sense of hostilty about the place, the quality of the food is inconsistent, the service is earnest but odd and spotty, and the prices aren't low enough to make up for those facts. Go to Gnocchi or La Fourno for better food and service at the same prices.

My friends and I visited here last Saturday night. We were looking for a casual BYO in the Queen Village area that we hadn't been to before, and stumbled upon Hosteria Da Elio. \n\nCute little place. We were seated in the front room, but there is a back dining area as well as a patio off the back. Most of the parties were couples on a night out - and the place is conducive to a first date \"getting to know you\" conversation, but it also accommodated our more rowdy group of four well and, with the multiple dining areas, could easily fit larger groups. \n\nI just wasn't overly impressed with the food. I ordered the linguine and clams - granted, a simple dish. My dish arrived with just the linguine tossed with diced clams. I was disappointed to not get a least a few clams still in their shells, if only for appearances sake. The rest of my party wasn't wowed by their dishes, but they were decent and filling.\n\nService was adequate - neither lacking nor overly exceptional.  \n\nAs a BYO in my neighborhood, I'll definitely give it another go, especially if I can sit outside.", "date": "2010-04-07 22:34:28", "user": {"name": "Lauren", "review_count": 115, "yelping_since": "2009-10-22 17:07:52", "elite": "2010", "average_stars": 3.59, "fans": 16}}
