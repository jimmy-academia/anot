Perhaps it's because I didn't start with the mimosa (or two).\n\nI ordered my standard breakfast - two eggs over medium, corned beef hash, potatoes, and got the biscuit.  The bf ordered pancakes and fruit and grits.  I got two eggs over easy plus all the rest of my order at a temperature that was luke warm. The biscuit was probably from scratch, but not particularly good.  Likewise, the corned beef hash was made in house (according to the menu), but overly salty, and without that good melded flavor that the potatoes and beef should get from cooking together with a binder (and also not that good luke warm).  Bf got pancakes that were burnt on the bottoms, artificial maple syrup, and fruit.  The grits never showed up, but were still on the bill.\n\nService was friendly enough.  Tea was an uninspired tea bag and cost as much as the corned beef hash ($2.50), which was a very bad deal - go with the mimosas, like everyone else said. Skip the tea and the corned beef hash.

It's hard to screw up breakfast (although I did get the breakfast sandwich on a very small biscuit and ended up having to deconstruct it since it was piled so high). \nSince I'm always willing to give a place a second shot, we tried it again a few days ago. On a Monday around 12.15 p.m. we sat at our table for 15 minutes before we were even greeted. All 3 of us in our party have worked in the service industry at one time or another so we're pretty patient and understanding if a server is in the weeds. I even told my husband, \"If they're busy then I get it, just tell us you'll be right with us and get us a water or something!\" Nothing. The host wouldn't make eye contact and there wasn't a manager to be seen. We ended up going to the bar to get our drinks, which took a long time, too, because the bartender automatically made my friend's drink a double and then had to void it out with a manager. \nWe waited about 50 minutes for food, no apologies for the slack service or time of our food. There was no check-back to see how our meals were until our plates were almost cleared.\nAgain, the food was just okay. Definitely not worth the wait.\nThe building is cute and it's convenient for people on the Uptown side of the Quarter or in the CBD. The waitstaff and host all seem like they have better things to do, though. \nIcing on the cake: as we left a server was sitting outside, near the entrance, smoking a cigarette.

Well, I really wanted to like this place based on the menu and that I snagged a table at the sidewalk on a beautiful day.\n\nI just wanted a little bit of food so I ordered the shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes with a side of cheese grits.  The tomatoes were in a good, flavorful breading, and fried nicely; not greasy at all.  Next to them was a little bed of mixed greens, and then the chilled shrimp remoulade.  If I were plating this, I would have put that over the tomatoes (especially since that's the menu description.)  Instead, it was off to the side and there was barely any sauce to it - I don't know, it just seemed plopped there and I would have liked enough sauce to actually dip more than one bite of the tomatoes in.  The shrimp also had an off texture, even accounting for the fact that it had been refrigerated.  The grits were standard mediocre diner fare, gloppy, and with just a sprinkle of shredded cheese.  They also committed the cardinal sin: no salt.\n\nSo I got my bill to put an end to all this, and thought I would just pay it and leave.  But wait, what's this?  Ummmmm, $2.00 plus $8.00 plus 98 cents tax equals a total of $10.98, yet the amount due is $11.00 even?  This doen't add up, literally.  The young waiter's explanation?  The computer does this sometimes randomly on people's bills?  Adds a cent or two?  Uh, no, I'm pretty sure you can't just do that.  I'm pretty sure that I've never seen that done anywhere else, and that if your establishment is well aware of this, then you should probably fix that - unless you're doing it intentionally.  I know it seems silly over just a couple of pennies, but if they do that to enough people, it can add up.

Then we noticed the tables along the back wall and one of our group asked if we could sit there. After some unnecessary discussion (why should there be a discussion--sitting at adjacent tables in two groups is better than sitting across the room from one another?), we were seated. Our group was the table of 5. Each group had a different server, in case you try to blame the service I will describe on just being an overwhelmed Waiter with a 9 top. \n\nI was excited looking at the menu, and almost went for breakfast at lunch, but since it was my first visit, I played it safe with the burger, but opted to pay $2 extra for the sweet potato fries since I saw that they came with a side of creole tomato dressing. \n\nThe burger was okay--just a burger, although I was happy to see that it was thoroughly cooked but not burnt. The sweet potato fries were very good--crispy with a slight flaky texture. I asked if they came with some sort of sauce and Waiter offered to bring out some of the dressing. \n\nThe bacon was left off of one co-worker's sandwich; this wasn't addressed with Waiter. Another coworker was served regular fries (kinda meh--seasoning reminded me of Rally's) instead of sweet potato fries. This was addressed with Waiter; he brings her a handful of fries on a plate and says the rest will be out in a minute. They never came, but when she was charged the full $2 for the fries on her bill, I asked Waiter if her fries were coming out soon when she asked for a to go box for the rest of her club sandwich (she's not as confrontational as I am). FYI, she said the club was delicious.\n\nWaiter offered to separate the checks, which was fine with us. We each gave him a card, and when he brought them back, he set them all in a pile in a wet spot on the table, with a \"Thanks, guys,\" and walked off. At this point, the lunch rush had leveled off, and there were many empty tables--it wouldn't have been impossible for him to take an extra 30 seconds with our table. We were left to sift through the wet receipts and credit cards to figure out what belonged to who. I tipped less than 20%, which I NEVER do--I can almost always rationalize poor service, but today, not so much. \n\nI'd heard really good things about the food at this place, and would have been excited to go back and try the breakfast menu.

I was in a tank top and shorts; froze the moment I walked in.  Asked two servers to turn up the A/C but finally i flagged down the manager who was happy to accommodate my request.  Our wait at 11:30 on a Sunday was about 15 minutes.  We had been told 25-30 so this was nice.  Make sure you check in on Yelp as you get 2-4-1 Mimosas!\nThe restaurant is cute but not over the top.  Three panels in the back talk about the food, the drink, and why they opened (to revitalize after Katrina).  I happened to visit the day before the six-year anniversary of Katrina and basically the whole city made no mention of it really.  No opinion either way on this. \nThe food: my table of 4 split the Peanut Butter Oreo pancakes (3) and some of it wasn't finished, only because we were saving room for our orders.  The pancakes were a little doughy (fixed by syrup) but definitely tasted like Oreos.  In fact, huge cookie pieces were evident and yummy.  I tasted no peanut butter.  \nI ordered the Eggs Blackstone.  Interesting take on Eggs Benedict but a miss in my opinion.  The server told me as he put down my plate that one of my eggs had broken and they gave me a little dish with a perfectly poached alternative.  However, after removing the broken egg (myself!) and putting the unbroken egg on top of the biscuit, i was in need of more hollandaise sauce.  Requested and served by the time i went to eat the second biscuit.  The taste overall of the blackstone, with applewood smoked bacon and tomato on biscuit instead of muffin, was okay.  The Hollandaise Sauce wasn't anything like what I've had in the past.  It was orange and not very buttery at all.  Two people who were traveling with us but weren't at breakfast with us, ate here about 3 hours after and felt the same about the sauce.  It's served with a small bowl of fruit, which contained about 7 1-inch square pieces of pineapple and honeydew, one strawberry sliced in half, 3 grapes and two small orange slices.  For $13 I would have appreciated a heartier side.  Oh well. I wasn't fulling sickenly full at the end of my meal so i kind of appreciated the fruit after teh fact.  My tablemates commented that their food was fine but not what they expected after hearing reviews from friends.  Service was good and they break out your check by seat #.  I had bottomless cup of coffee because I was so cold and it tasted fine.\nIf I go back, I will order the Bananas Foster French Toast.  Looked delish!", "date": "2011-08-29 18:45:48"}

It is hard to miss as it is surrounded by a swirling mass of people, as if they were caught in some gravitational pull.\n\nDespite the very long line, I was able to sit at the last seat at the bar (it pays to go solo sometimes). However, once I sat down, service was a little slow, In defense of the waitress, it was at capacity at around 25 people and she was the only person behind the bar. That is a fail on the part of management that couldn't predict a Saturday morning rush.  \n \nWhile waiting, I pulled up Yelp and instantly saw my choice--the Eggs Blackstone. Pretty much eggs Benedict, but on a biscuit. If ever you should see something like this on the menu, get it!\n\nAfter waiting a good 10 minutes, I got the menu and ordered my coffee. Another 10 minutes pass before actually getting my coffee and being able to order... which ended up breaking my heart--they were OUT OF BACON!!! \n\nBacon being the proverbial glue that connects the eggs to the biscuit is an essential component of the Eggs Blackstone. And they didn't have any. Breakfast without bacon is like an earth without water: incapable of sustaining life. Without this, it is just eggs with tomato on some carbs. Unacceptable. In my sorrow, I ordered what appeared to be the closest thing--Eggs Cochon: slow cook pork debris served over an open-faced biscuit, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise.\n\nTrue to its word, the slow cook pork came slowly. About to eat my hand off and having finished my coffee 5 minutes ago, this beast of a plate appeared before me. I didn't really know what to expect, but what I saw made me think of pulled pork in gravy sloppy joe, with poached eggs and sauce. Hiding beneath this mountain of fat and grease were some carbs in the form of soggy biscuits. While no means bad--and actually good at first--it was a bit much. A bit much for breakfast and a bit much to eat without having my coffee refilled. After putting it away, I finally got my first refill and downed that in a heartbeat. \n\nOverall, service was crap due to so many people and poor management. I felt bad for the waitress, but still begrudged my lack of coffee. Then for not having bacon, I am sorry. There is no excuse for an established early on Saturday morning to have run out of bacon. Together, this knocks off two stars. The food was food, but not worth the wait to get in, fight to get attention, and disappointment of maybe not having bacon. I'd consider coming back here, but only if it were not busy, which I am not sure happens.\n\nBacon.", "date": "2011-12-07 16:13:20"}

My sister (a professional waitress) gave very high marks to our server for her performance for being prompt and knowledgeable. I started with a wonderful mimosa that hit the spot and tasted the coffee which was also quite good. Just FYI, the banana fosters french toast is all that it is cracked up to be!!! It is beautifully presented and by far the best french toast I've ever had! The bacon was also delicious! Everyone was happy with their breakfast choices, commenting and all the nice touches, including the refreshing-ness of the multi grain toast served as opposed to the traditional white bread at many breakfast venues.\nWe were so happy with this place that we ended up coming here again the last morning we were in NOLA. Interestingly enough, you can skirt the high price of the Blackstone ($13) by ordering the breakfast sandwich with poached eggs and a side of hollindaise. ($6.75) You don't get the side of fruit/toast, but you still get full! The waitress the second time around was different and was really pushing the up-sales so it wasn't as pleasant, but the food makes this place worth it. A must eat!\n\nBottom Line: Average priced restaurant with an inspiring story and an OUTSTANDING breakfast just west of the French Quarter. Eat here!!!", "date": "2012-03-06 06:47:30"}

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and the culinary genre I enjoy the most. Their dishes were such a fun, and sensational twist on the average eggs Benedict or French toast. Skipping the menu entirely I choose their special of the day- poached eggs over French bread, fresh spinach, seasoned artichoke hearts and plump champagne cherub tomatoes. The sauce was a red pepper pur\u00e9e and while that sounded spectacular enough to a Texas girl visiting the Big Easy, I'm a sucker for hollandaise and the heart wants what it wants! Not wanting to miss ANYTHING I ordered both sauces and was in heaven. I actually thought to myself whether the looks I'd potentially receive would be worth licking the plate clean- it was that good! My friends had the classic scrambled egg breakfast with homemade buttermilk biscuits. They were in love with the red pepper pur\u00e9e and found themselves adding it to everything- roasted red potatoes, eggs, sausage...\n\n If you are in NOLA do yourself a favor and try this place!

We asked where my plate was \"ummm... you didnt say you wanted us to remake it?\" What?? So I waited over an hour to just sit here and not eat anything?!?!  Even the side of pancake NEVER came. My husband's chicken sandwhich was rubbery and the caprese sandwhich had no flavor. The best thing was the fries. As my friend was eating his food, a busboy came over and  as he asked if he was done, took his plate away with fries still on it. My friend said no, I wasn't done yet and the guy said \"that's why I asked\" and threw the plate back down. It was obvious that coming late screwed us- they were out of food and clearly just wanted us out.  PS: I'm still hungry!", "date": "2013-03-11 16:44:46"}

We tried to find a few other places via Yelp but they were both closed. This was our 3rd choice and it said it was closing at 2:00. we got there at 1:40 or so.\n\nWe got 2 things, 1 recommended by the waitress (and people here) and the catfish special. Because I wanted catfish and it looked good. \n\nFirst was the eggs cachon, as recommended by several people and the waitress. This was average. I liked the toasted roll as a base and the meat was obviously well-thought out, but it lacked flavor to bring it all together. The eggs were poached too long so they weren't very runny. And there was too little sauce. On that note, too much meat threw off the balance because it didn't have enough flavor, not enough sauce, and not enough egg yolk. \n\nI love the concept though. Maybe it was rushed because it was too close to 2:00? We didn't get the feel from anyone working there that this was the case. They were content to let everyone just sit there and enjoy the day. \n\nSecond dish was a catfish special, which had plenty of sauce and some pork and spinach and tomatoes and artichoke hearts and was nothing short of incredible. Go here, get this, if it's on the menu that day.\n\nOverall I'm a fan and it's possible I go back to try the Migas or the lox, but there's so much good food in this city I try not to go back to the same place twice.\n\nIn edit - I changed this from a 4 to a 5. After spending 5 days in NOLA I appreciate this place more. The food was fresh and innovative, and in light of everything else we ate it was a 5 star breakfast place. Since it was the first meal we had here it was hard to judge it in any context.

We went for 11am Sunday brunch (I'd rather wait than get up early, whatever) and waited a little less than the 35 minutes they told us.  Pleasant that they give you a wait time, so you can decide if it's worth it.  My biggest complaint is that they don't advertise that you can get a drink at their bar (not seated, just order it) to have while you wait.  I would have loved to ease the wait with a bloody mary (hell, it's NOLA, okay!), and it would be more profitable to them, anyway.  I only realized they allowed this when I saw several people get seated with drinks in hand (and they both state and enforce you can't enter with outside beverages).  Their rules are posted, and are legit: no outside drinks, no reservations, and have your whole party ready.  We watched a number of ignorant patrons try to break all three, but they do it to keep things moving, and really, they're quite efficient.\n\nFood is great, as everyone says.  Bananas foster was invented in New Orleans, so if you're a tourist you have to get that.  It's amazing, and the bacon is a nice salty compliment to the sweet dish.  They make a good bloody mary, not really hot but very peppery and spicy.  Also, their founding story about coming back after Katrina and doing their part to rebuild the city is nice; a feel-good yummy NOLA Sunday brunch.", "date": "2013-07-29 20:26:43"}

We went on a weekend and waited about 20 minutes to get in, which we were fine with. From what we noticed, it's much busier on weekends.. So hit up a week day if you have the time! \n\n  We sat at the bar, which was perfect for the 3 of us. The atmosphere was so fun and the interior so vibrant with Dorothy's Ruby Slipper accents all over the place (from art on the wall to a tape dispenser on the bar!) After looking at the extensive menu we all decided on the blackstone. It was INCREDIBLE. Served on a soft biscuit, the eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly and the bacon was delicious. The home fries were out of this world and I would definitely suggest getting them over the fruit cup (nothing special there). \n\n  The special on the day we were there was the turtle pancake. It was a fluffy pancake with chocolate and carmel syrup and pecans. We got one to share between the three of us and although it was delicious, we were too full to finish it!\n\n  The final highlight of the meal was the Bloody Mary! I am not typically into spicy things, but this was incredible! They have huge jugs of the mix up on the bar and add it to the vodka (filled to about 3/4 of a pint glass with ice!!!) when you order. It is garnished with a lemon, lime, olive and 2 green peppers that soak up the spice and alcohol and are a tasty treat at the end!! Just thinking about the Bloody Mary is making me itching to go back!!\n\nOverall we had a great experience and it was worth the money! I spent about $24 with tax and tip for the Bloody Mary and the blackstone. I will definitely be going back on  my next trip to NOLA!!", "date": "2013-08-21 13:41:30"}

Every time we walked by this cafe, we noticed a huge crowd, so one morning, when we did not feel like walking back up to the French Quarter for the umpteenth time, we decided to stop by Ruby Slipper.\n\nWe were there on a Saturday around 11 so the breakfast crowd was just starting to leave while the lunch crowd was beginning to trickle in. As soon as I opened the door to the cafe, I was greeted by a blast of noise from the multiple conversations going on all at once in a large echoic building. Since we were there for a nice romantic weekend together, my boyfriend and I did not feel up to sitting in such a crowd shouting at one another just to have a conversation, so we opted to order to go. Unfortunately, the cafe does not take to-go orders on weekends, so we decided to get a table and hope for the best. \n\nAfter about a fifteen-minute wait, we were of course seated between two large groups of young men who had arrived to cure their hangovers. Nevertheless, we felt that if we could not enjoy the atmosphere, we could at least enjoy the food. We took advantage of their breakfast-all-day menu. Since we were both big fans of the original egg benedict, I ordered the eggs cochon, and my boyfriend ordered the CBH Benedict. The eggs cochon basically consisted of pulled pork, with eggs benedict. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the dryness of the pulled pork, especially since I was expecting braised pork, and the way it sopped up the egg yolk so that it became just one very salty, soggy mess. I was only able to stomach one of the two I was served. My boyfriend, however, did not mind downing his CBH Benedict and my remaining eggs cochon. His CBH Benedict consisted of beef hash and an egg benedict. The one bite I stole from his plate revealed a very moist and tender slice of beef that surprisingly complimented his egg benedict. But, like my eggs cochon, it seemed rather salty. \n\nWhile the Ruby Slipper was conveniently close to our hotel, had quick service, and had an impressive menu, I was disappointed by the fact that we spent the entire dry, salty meal in silence. On our next trip to NOLA, we'll have to pass on revisiting this cafe.", "date": "2013-09-18 13:08:25"}

Or, we tried to at least. \n\nWhen we got there, the wait was twenty minutes. This wasn't a problem so we crossed the street to wait in the sun, like so many other patrons. More diners came after us and, after twenty minutes of waiting, we went to make sure we hadn't missed our name. \"One more table ahead of you,\" we were told. \n\nSo we moseyed back over and resumed waiting. Then, a couple who had arrived after us got called. Since they were two and we were three, we assumed we would be next. Over the next fifteen minutes, however, we saw at least 4 groups of three and a group of six, all of whom arrived after we did, get called in to eat. \n\nBefuddled, we headed back into the busy restaurant to see what was happening. We were first ignored for a solid five minutes before anyone even looked at us. When we finally were spoken to, we were frustrated and we may have expressed that in our tones. We will admit that. However, instead of being apologetic, the host was curt and abrasive, putting his hand up and shrilly exclaiming, \"give me a minute!\" Seriously, dude?\n\nAfter he and the other host talked quietly for a minute, the host said \"it will be another minute.\" We were over it, so we left. Why should we want to give our money to a place where we have to throw a fit to get served? The food may have been good, but we'll never know. \n\nInstead we hopped on the 11 bus and found our way to Surrey's, where we were seated and served promptly and had a wonderful breakfast. \n\nMy advice on the Ruby Slipper? Avoid, if at all possible.", "date": "2013-10-25 16:21:39"}

I was really not expecting that. Dont wait until the last minute if you have to potty. There are only two stalls and since its a pretty sizable restaurant and its sharing with another business, you WILL be in trouble. \n\nThey had bellinis though.

The omelet was quite large, however the amount of filling was just adequate.  The chorizo was good, but it wasn't the super-intense style (which was OK, given that it was in an omelet). Overall my omelet was very good.  \n\nThe omelet came with a choice of grits or breakfast potatoes and toast or a biscuit.  Since I'm not from the south, I opted for the potatoes and (multi-grain) toast.  The toast was ordinary (but isn't most toast ordinary?).  The potatoes were large-ish chunks of small red potatoes.  They were likely partly cooked by boiling, then finished on the flattop.  They were moderately browned (but not crispy) and had a hint of rosemary flavor. Overall they were quite tasty taters. \n\nThe coffee was better than average. A nice touch  -- my server gave me a full to-go cup of coffee when I left. \n\nI sat at the counter; service was prompt and courteous.  My coffee cup was kept full.  \n\nDecor is pretty old school. The high-ceiling space has a nice feel.  Everything looked clean and in good repair.\n\nThe food alone would be four stars, but taken as a whole, I'll give the Ruby Slipper the full five stars!", "date": "2014-01-10 13:55:35"}

Wait was tolerable, they were turnin and burnin. Had a Bloody Mary to kick off the day, and it was very spicy, and had pickled green beans as a garnish (a first for me). \n\nTable ordered French toast pain perdu, spinach bacon and Swiss omelet with deep fried potatoes, corned beef bennies, shrimp and grits. \n\nThe biscuits were epic in size and flavor, kinda crusty, crispy but very soft inside. \n\nThe shrimp and grits were good, not fabulous, lacked some basic seasoning and needed something else. Not sure. It wasn't horrible, just not memorable. I also ordered the corned beef hash side, fresh, good, again lacked some seasoning or that one ingredient that makes you go WOW. The horseradish cream sauce I ordered with it (one of the 'Bennie' ingredients) made it, that and the bottom half of the epic biscuit. The top half was munched with butter and grape jelly. Too bad they didn't have some sort of home made jam or marmalade.\n\nI tasted the French toast, it was made with French bread (like po boy bread I guess), very good. Boss finished her omelet, the potatoes were reported as really good by number one son, I did not partake. They were small, maybe new or red potatoes that were halved or quartered and fried to a dark golden brown then had some sort of magic seasoning. The omelet was fried well in a thick circle of eggyness, then folded over. I like mine very thin like a crepe, but I didn't order it, so who cares?\n\nSolid choice for breakfast, and they also have brunch and lunch items but our krewe did not go there. Portion size is large. No cafe au lait, but they had steamed milk? That confused me. The server didn't seem to know what I was asking for on that one. For some reason he did not charge for coffee and tea and chased us down outside when they lost one of the signed receipts during busing. We liked how a larger party could pay by the seat (put seats 1,4, and 6 on this card, and the rest on that one).  Very convenient. We had 6 people, gratuity was added for us.\n\nI answered the survey questions and they do have two televisions at this location, the one I noticed was tuned to CNN, no way you could have heard it in this place when we were there. Probably convenient for the business types' weekday breakfast routine.", "date": "2014-03-16 08:13:37"}

We arrived at 9:30 and only had about a 30 min wait.....I was expecting worse.  However, when the hostess came to see us she freaked out that there were only 5 of us present (my boyfriend had gone to add more change to the meter).  She even started asking random people if they were our 6th.....ummm, chill girlfriend.  She was obviously quite flustered and wasn't dealing with the hustle and bustle very well.\n\nI saw that the menu only mentioned the double sized alcoholic beverages, so when our waiter arrived I asked if I could have a regular size (as I have always done at another location).  He was very unappologetic when he informed me that they had recently revised the menu and only offer the double size.  REALLY?  Um, not everyone wants to get schwasted in the am.  First, I think this was a dumb move by management, and I wasn't impressed by my waiter's response.\n\nOther than some mildly rude service, the rest of our experience was great.  Our food arrived pretty quickly considering how busy the place was.  I ordered the Eggs Blackstone (poached eggs, bacon, tomatoe, biscuit, hollandaise) and it was delicious.  My egg was a little over cooked, but it was still very tasty.  Other folks at the table ordered the Smoked Salmon Bennie and commented on how good it was.  Although the salmon wasn't really smoked salmon....looked like it had been baked....but again, still tasty.  2 other friends got the Costa Rican Breakfast and raved.  The shrimp and grits were delish too.  Overall a solid experience.....but I think the staff needs to brush up on their manners a bit.\n\nUpdate: Revised to 2 stars.  I've eaten here again and another dissapointing experience.  I ordered the migas which I've had several times at another location.  They were not good here.  And just this morning, my boyfriend tried to take his parents from out of town here because they were staying near by and it's closed.  Nothing on the website....just closed for maintenance.

On Tuesday we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Their signature dishes all look great. I can vouch for the Eggs Cochon and Bananas Foster Pain Perou.

Our group of 7 only had to wait about half an hour.  The space is large and beautiful.  The menu includes typical brunch staples such as omelets, pancakes, and French toast.  It also offers the southern breakfast (which I had), shrimp and grits, and a bunch of other goodies.  My breakfast left me full and satisfied.  The biscuits were perfect without butter.  The eggs were fluffy.  The bacon was crisp.  And the fried green tomato hit the spot.  Everything that everyone at our table ordered looked amazing.  It also was pretty easy on the wallet, which is always appreciated.  \n\nI only knocked off a star because they \"forgot\" my order when everything else came out.

Oh my lawd (southern enough?) was this brunch delicious to the point of forcing me to redefine what I find delicious.\n\nLets start with the bad - not that there is such a thing.  You have to wait to come here.  There are no reservations and there will be a line.  You can't wait inside, either, so not a great place in bad weather.  People mill about on the side walk outside and across the street.  But, even the bad isn't that bad.  I know this wasn't mardi gras or jazz fest, but it was Easter Weekend and it was in between Easter parades (not to go off on a tangent, but you need to visit NOLA on Easter.  It is a trip).  Anyway, we were told a table for 2 would be 30 minutes.  It might have been 40, but not too far off, and based on the crowd, we thought it would be more like 60.  They move it fast.\n\nIts a cute place, nothing too memorable, but bright and pleasant.  Service was great - server was on top of things and friendly.\n\nBut the important part was the food.  If I can quote Frank the Tank when he saw Blue in heaven, it was \"glorious.\"  Anyway, I got the Eggs Cochon - I was waffling (get it, waffle? brunch? waffling?  I know I know, I'm a riot) between that and the Chicken St. Charles.  The latter has fried chicken, the former has apple braised pork debris.  I almost went with the chicken because I ate lots o' pork this weekend, but in the end, I went with the signature item and am I glad I did.  This came out with what seemed like a mountain of braised, slow cooked, pulled pork on a buttermilk biscuit and 2 perfectly poached eggs.  It was so much wonderful food.  I haven't had a brunch that good since...well, the day before actually at Stanley's...but this was much better than that, and that was great.\n\nAnd, because I am a piggy and my girlfriend allows me to be a piggy and will participate in my pigginess though in no way in the world am I attributing pigginess to my girlfriend, we also got their bananas fosters french toast.  Never tasted anything like it.  You have to get this - it was so deliciously wonderful (and it came with a side of bacon, so more pork for me!). \n\nRuby Slipper has to be a go-to place for you if you want a fantastic brunch in NOLA.

He was willing to make suggestions which is always nice. We only had one misstep from a small miscommunication; my Bananas Foster was supposed to come with applewood smoked bacon.

(I'm sorry, did you say IN PLACE OF THE BACON?! Obviously not). Anyway, he assumed that I meant fruit instead of bacon, when I meant in addition to. My fault? His fault? Who knows.

I have my theories as to why but I wont say but yeah I guess i wasnt the right....\n\nAnyway, worse than the awful service my food came out cold, like completely cold.  I cant even call it luke warm it was cold like maybe it had been sitting in a refrigerator and warmed up to room temperature.  I dont understand even how a breakfast can come out cold when breakfast food cooks so quick (especially what I ordered).  I ordered the southern breakfast. I mean it doesnt even make sense that it would be that cold from them waiting but I dont understand how the man next me and my order came out together even though he came after me, it still shouldnt have been THAT cold. The grits were were room temp. gross. the bacon was undercooked and floppy and cold!! just straight cold. The fried green tomato was mushy all around.  The more I type the more Im coming to realization, Im starting to think this was someones breakfast from earlier and they sent it back or changed their mind and the cafe left it sitting there and decided to serve it to my black self later. The biscuit was room temp and the worse this is what really did it for me the eggs were cold.  HOW ARE EGGS COLD??!!!! when they supposedly just came out of a skillet, clearly these were not.  Even the coffee wasnt hot it was just warm.   \n\n\nI was so disappointed in this place.  After coming here on recommendation and it getting great reviews I did not have a good experience.

I must say, the hostess' pretentiousness is outstanding! Bravo! At least at Per Se the host/hostess graciously decline your rumbling, empty stomach with a smile, rather than a yelling, meth and/or tobacco stained RBF. Seriously girl, the hostess on the morning of Sept 14th needs some Crest whitening strips, STAT! Moving on, we were told there was over an hour wait on Sunday morning by the meth girl wielding an ipad. I was apprehensive to give it another try the following morning but the yelp reviews (and proximity to the hotel) swayed me. Upon arrival Monday morning, there was a 15 minute wait. Ok, great! We were asked to wait outside bc of fire hazards, yadda yadda. I had no problem with this however, I think the older couple wheeling their oxygen tank should have received preferential treatment. Making two octogenarians wait outside in 100% humidity (no joke, my iphone said so) is just WRONG! When our time was up, the hostess (the one that looks like the boss-lady on Workaholics, for real) called our name and began walking us past the podium asking \"Is the bar ok?\". In unison, we responded \"NO?!\" We just waited 15 minutes for a table!!! We could have sat at the bar upon initial arrival!!! WTH?\nMy bf and I had decided on what we were going to order while we waited to be seated. Being so efficient blew the waitresses mind. I ordered the house specialty, Eggs Cochon. I can't even remember what my man ordered, it was so blas\u00e9. My plate was literally covered in a layer of grease. The way the biscuits were plated made me think the server pulled the plate prematurely bc they had been huddled on one side of the plate, leaving the other side completely empty, aside from the grease layer. The meat was flavorless. It speaks volumes that they cook and serve flavorless pig! Yes, it was juicy and tender- really fabulous texture, BUT flavorless! This makes me very sad. The poached eggs were poached eggs. Frankly, if you cannot cook an egg properly, you should not own a breakfast/brunch restaurant, so I don't feel compelled to give exemplary marks for such a simple task. Onto the hollandaise... What a joke??! Hollandaise should NEVER be highlighter orange a la Kraft Singles! I don't care if your yolks are so friggin vitamin/lutiein rich, cage-free fresh! Anyone who has ever eaten a real/proper hollandaise would find what the Ruby Slipper serves to be disgusting and an insult to eggs, chickens and palates. Without a doubt, it started off as a pre-packaged powder that morning. The foundation of this food tower was a biscuit. It was good but heavy- not in the \"I just soaked up some pork juice\" heavy but more like \"the butter was not cold enough when baked\" heavy. I also ordered a double mimosa, which, I must say, was amazing! I must have gotten a bottle that was freshly popped bc the drink was crisp, refreshing and just what a girl needs before a three hour flight! The coffee was nice and hot but upon asking for a refill, we were met with a chilly response. If the d\u00e9cor wasn't so in your FACE about \"home\" and \"hospitality\" I probably would not have found the service to be so rough. The fact that the menu preaches about coming back home after Katrina to serve the community speaks volumes. The hospitality we received made it crystal clear they have ZERO interest in serving anyone but the locals.\n***For a good time and AMAZING FOOD (and no wait) try Red Gravy- just a block away! We went after being rejected from RS on Sunday and were introduced to Southern Hospitality with a NJ flare. Everyone working was wearing their warmest, most sincere smile. My goodness, what a gem?!", "date": "2014-09-22 20:35:37"}

I thought the seasoning was fine on my dish. Not too heavy either.\n\nThat's it. That's the review. The 2 others in our party had other food which I'm sure was good but I didn't try it so there you have it. If it sucked they would have said something.

I had already been in town for 3 days and hadn't noticed the sweet little caf\u00e9 right around the corner from our hotel (just off Canal).\n\nFirst, let me say that all the food we had during our visit to New Orleans was superb. We had delicious fish, Cajun, pasta, steak (and that's saying a lot coming from an Iowan), and of course beignets. The two meals we had at Ruby Slipper were bar none the best of our entire visit.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe wait:\n\nThe line for a table appeared to be long each morning (we could see the front of the restaurant from our hotel room). We waited for the line to die down each morning, and visited around 11:30 on a Sunday and 10:30 on a Monday morning. We got right in on Sunday and waited about 10 minutes on Monday.\n\nThe service:\n\nGood on our fist visit and fantastic on our second. Our fist server was attentive and our order was correct on our first visit. The server on our second visit was personable and proactive (my coffee cup was always full--my #1 priority). \n\nThe food:\n\nThe real star of the show. Between our two visits, we tried the sliders, French toast, breakfast sandwich, and an eggs/grits/bacon breakfast. It was seemed to be \"normal\" food...we should be able to get an equivalent meal somewhere else, but it wasn't normal. It was delightful. The bacon, for example, was maple-y and cooked to perfection (again, we live in Iowa, home to Baconfest, so us raving about bacon is not to be taken lightly). The French toast was warm and melted in my mouth goodness, and everything else was just magical. \n\nDrinks:\n\nThe coffee was great diner-style coffee, and I also had a mimosa, which was strong and had what seemed to be fresh squeezed OF. \n\nThe cost:\n\nAffordable! Each plate was about $10, making our meals not only the best of our visit to NOLA but also the most budget-friendly.\n\nBe sure to visit The Ruby Slipper next time you are in town.", "date": "2014-11-24 19:57:14"}

I waded through the crowd and the super friendly hostess took my name and said it would likely be 10-15 minutes for a table.  \n\nI wanted something different and local so I went for one of their signature items, the Eggs Cochon.  It starts with a homemade biscuit that's halved, then each half is topped with a pile of pulled pork debris, a poached egg, and finished with hollandaise.  It was freaking great!  The biscuit tasted very fresh and the pork had a nice hint of smoke to it.  The whole thing was just what I needed as a base for a busy day of bar hopping.  I tried their grits and wasn't too impressed, but that didn't take much away from the great meal.  My brother got the Eggs Cochon too and loved it as well, and his wife got the Eggs Coubion.  Hers was \"Thin-fried Mississippi farm-raised catfish over French bread  spears, topped with poached eggs, a saut\u00e8 of spinach, tomatoes, artichoke hearts and tasso, finished with a Creole tomato Courtbouillon\".  Wow, she shared some of her catfish and it was awesome.  At first it seemed weird to get fish and eggs for breakfast, but after seeing it I could see trying it out sometime.\n\nThe next time we had a longer wait, more like 30 minutes.  Probably because we had a couple of more people then, making a party of five.  I went for the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu.  I wanted something sweet and it fit the bill nicely.  They use French bread spears and cover them all with the rum-flamb\u00e9ed bananas & raisins, with some bacon on the side.  It was great!  Everyone else loved their choices too: a couple of Eggs Blackstone, Louisianan omelet, and a Spanish omelet.  \n\nI can't vouch for all their locations, but this one in the CBD was awesome.

Our waiter was personable and very helpful with the menu. We all got a morning beverage to continue the Bachelorette fun. Two of our friends opted for the bloody mary which they thoroughly enjoyed and the other 3 of us got the mimosa. The mimosa was memorable because it was made with orange juice, champagne and pomegranate juice. The pomegranate juice was a pleasant surprise. A few of us asked the waiter for a suggestion on the menu and recommended the Catfish \"St. Peter.\" We were sold. When our meal came out, the presentation was beautiful. The catfish was cooked to perfection and the cheesy grits melted in our mouths. The waiter knew what he was talking about!!

I am a very impatient person at times and did not want to wait but I was convinced that it would be worth it so we hung around. It was about 20-25mins until we were seated at the bar where I was greeted then served by Gina. I ordered the short stack with chicken sausage, which was great as I do not eat pork, eggs and their home-style potatoes. I had a cup of tea to cap off my meal as anything too sugary would have been a bit much after pouring a mountain of syrup on my cakes. \n\nNeedless to say I loved it! I will definitely be returning there again as I am eager to try some of the many options they offer on their menu.

In fact they are some of the most non-personable, unpleasant, unwelcoming hostesses I've ever experienced in New Orleans! (Last year when my sisters were visiting from Atlanta, one of the hostesses was so unfriendly they vowed never to return--right before hitching a taxi across town to Atchafalaya;) Perhaps these girls should be reminded that this is not Lilette, Le Petit Grocery, or Revolution so there's no need for the snobbery. Secondly, there's a \"bipolar\" bartender that's sometimes very nice and sometimes considerably bitchy. (Though the other bartender MJ is the cat's meow.) Thirdly, on two occasions my eggs have been brought out completely cold, and the last time I visited I had to wait over 30 minutes for the Southern Breakfast (eggs, grits, a biscuit, and a flavorless fried tomato) when people sitting around me who'd arrived way after I ordered seemed to have only waited 10-15 minutes for their more elaborate meals...\n\nNow clearly this place is not suffering from a lack of patrons, with endless winding lines around the corner almost every weekend (though my guess is that it's gotten lots of possibly outdated press and has become a trap for tourists who don't know any better), so maybe there's not much of a motivation or desire to improve/modify anything going on there.

We took our place in the 30-45 min. line and waited with the other loiterers outside. Three years ago we were told to try this little place called  \"the Ruby Slipper\" for breakfast...now they have several locations. This trip we were excited to find a location near our hotel the Marriott JW but we had a plane to catch. Still, we felt determined to complete our mission. I was pretty surprised that there was not a solid fried oyster option on the menu, although the menu did offer many delicious options with easy pricing. I wanted to order the fried chicken breast with hollandaise sauce on poached eggs etc. etc. but I chickened out no pun intended. I ordered the bacon lettuce tomato fried green tomato sandwich on toasted brioche roll with shoestring french fries. Because it was breakfast and because of other reasons that are obvious I ordered a over easy fried egg to go with the sandwich. Even before the fried egg sandwich was too big to eat as a sandwich. It was delicious and every way and if it were not for the guy sitting next to me at the counter eating the fried chicken with sauce and poached eggs I may have been completely satisfied. My husband enjoyed his dish and loved the homemade sausage. I had a bite and it was very interesting as he described it with lots of herbs. \nWe enjoyed the Ruby slipper immensely and Will keep it in the rotation for next time.", "date": "2015-03-28 13:50:36"}

But my number one is service, and because the restaurants food is good, it doesn't compare to the way your treated because that has a significant impact on your visit.\n\nWe were really excited to try the food cause we had heard such good things about this place. We had bought Starbucks on our way to the restaurant. The hostess told us it would be about 20mins for a table yeah sure fine. Our group of four all had Starbucks in our hands. So it was clearly visible to the young lady we had them.\n\nWe waited the 20mins and my friends all finished their Starbucks before me and I still had 2/3 of my latte left. When the hostess sat us down she said \"oh by the way there is no outside drinks allowed\" there all of us were dumbfounded like uhhhhh NOW you tell us? I just spent 6$ on this and she is telling me I can either throw it away or she can hold it at her little host stand. \n\nI get it you don't want to take away from your business of your crappy auto drip bland coffee but she should have told us to make sure we finished the drinks before we were called in. My friend far from ok with this got a separate cup to put the coffee in so I don't have to throw it away. Of course the hostess being a major B word decided that's not ok and my friend asked for a manager. And I spent four years in food service and I still haven't forgot the days that the customer is always right. But this guy started arguing with us claiming we were verbally 'attacking' him. What? Look if taking away from your business of the Starbucks coffee is threatening to you why is the big deal putting it in a damn cup a problem that has no logo on it? \n\nIn the end the manager caved giving us the cup but by the time we all sat down we were so emotionally withdrawn with two horrible service contacts one including a manager we decided to leave so they didn't spit in our food. By that time after all the arguing I had already finished the latte.\n\nThe situation could've been handle so much better then the way they presented it too us. It all started by us checking in, if the hostess told us when we asked for a table to finish before be walked in there would've been NO issue at all.", "date": "2015-03-29 01:04:30"}

Because of this, I knew I had to pay them a visit to see if the \"shoe\" fits and it certainly does!\n\n----The Food----\nEggs Cochon ($13.00)- This dish was a dream, mainly because of the pork! Noted as their signature item, it's an eggs benedict with slow cooked, apple braised pork stacked on homemade buttermilk biscuits, topped with large poached eggs, and drizzled with hollandaise sauce.  I could eat that tender, flavorful pork all day.  While this plate is one of my favorite dishes in NOLA, I felt the thick hollandaise sauce could've used more kick/flavor.  Thankfully, the perfectly poached eggs provided some yolk to amplify the taste.  The buttermilk biscuits are admittedly better than Stanley's too.\n\nBananas Foster Pain Perdu ($11.00)- I commend The Ruby Slipper Cafe for trying to bring a different element to this popular dish by using actual french baguette and cutting it in odd/unique fashion to form their french toast on this plate.   However, I feel it took away from the texture of french toast that I prefer.  While it was still enjoyable, I felt myself quickly overwhelmed at meals end.  The Banana Foster at Stanley wins in this battle.  This plate is also served with rum flambeed bananas, raisins, and applewood bacon which all overshadowed the french toast, easily.  \n\nCheese grits ($3.25)- Who doesn't like cheese grits?! \n----\nConclusion: With the fun, charming atmosphere and vast, affordable brunch menu, I'd recommend this spot as a must-visit in NOLA--ESPECIALLY for their Eggs Cochon!\n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Parties of 6 or more will be charged a 18% service charge\n-Love the decor, seating styles, chalkboard menus, and picnic tables outside\n-Wait times seem to be fumed about on Yelp, but I was seated quickly\n-Service could be more attentive here, but friendly\n-Restrooms could be cleaner", "date": "2015-04-15 22:09:27"}

I has a bad ass breakfast sammy, a buttered biscuit filled with two eggs with american cheese, a slice of fried green tomato, two strips of candied bacon, changed my mind about 12 times before blurting out bananas foster on french toasted bread...to say these were two of the best meals we had on this trip would be repeating myself.  We'll definitely need to plan another trip to this city of food heaven.", "date": "2015-05-15 00:39:19"}

I was greeted promptly, and didn't wait long for my coffee.  The menu had a lot of items I would enjoy.  Which is great for a limited menu.  I had the Chicken St. Charles.  It's a biscuit split in 2 both sides have chicken fried chicken breasts, poached eggs (I got mine scrambled), topped with gravy.  The eggs were great.  The chicken had a saltier style breading, which I like, but if you're sensitive to salt, maybe not for you.  The biscuit was good, but I would have enjoyed it a little softer.  With the chicken being crispy, it would be nice to have it surrounded by softer items.  However, I enjoyed the breakfast.  I felt rejuvenated after eating it.  Service was great.  You won't get 5 star service in a place like this.  What you should expect is fast and courteous service.  You will get that here.  The team seems comfortable with high volume, and work as a team.

The boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary and it was nice and spicy. I think they pre-made large quantities of mix and it worked soooo much better than zing zang. \n\nThe food!! Was the crowning point of the experience. I ordered the salmon, poached egg, hollandaise with capers on a biscuit and let me tell you, yum!

Sorry for all the text, I promise I'm a man of few words - so you know they're required...\n\nWife-unit's Eggs Cochon: overall she enjoyed them, but noted a few things regarding her plate: 1. there wasn't enough sauce, 2. her bacon wasn't crispy (as requested), 3. the egg was almost cold (even sitting on top of warm meat).  You can see from the pics here on Yelp the inconsistency in the sauce... some have quite a bit, others very little.\n\nMy \"cheesecake\" french toast: unfortunately worse.  Actually, again you don't have to look any further than the pictures right here on Yelp of the french toast or pancakes to again see how inconsistently they are cooked.  Mine was basically burned on one side of the bread (even darker than any of the pictures I can find posted here), and the other side was completely uncooked.  Maybe they thought it would even out? ;-)  I realize they're kinda making a sandwich with the \"filling\" between two pieces of french toast, but it ends up being too soggy if they don't fry both sides of the toast.\n\nWith so many other options, I'd be hard pressed to go back.", "date": "2015-10-26 15:38:56"}

Apparently, they don't start taking names for the list until after they have filled the entire restaurant for the first time.

CHARLES for $13 (fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit topped with two poached eggs, finished with a pork tasso cream sauce). Sadly it looked and sounded better than it was. The biscuit was stale, the chicken was over-breaded and the cream sauce was nothing special. And I could not finish it, and not because I was full, but because I couldn't handle the staleness of the biscuit and the breading on the chicken - and I love fried chicken! The second time I visited (felt I had just come on a bad day the first time), I had the EGGS COCHON for $13, which is one of their signature dishes (slow-cooked, apple-braised pork debris served over an openfaced housemade buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with hollandaise). This dish was better than the fried chicken Benny, but the pork was really dry. Good thing I had taken a friend's recommendation and asked for extra hollandaise. The biscuit this time was not stale and enjoyed the dish well enough. Now, do I recommend this place? Definitely go once to see what all the hype is about, but I don't think I would return if I visited NOLA again. Also, the service is hit or miss.

There was no smile, no \"hello\" or \"welcome to Ruby Slipper\" which sucked. She was also less than encouraging about the 15-20 minute wait that I thought was pretty minimal but from the look on her face and the \"Debbie Downer\" tone of her voice you'd if thought she was the one having to wait in line!!!\n\nThe rest of the staff were quite friendly, smiling and welcoming. We were seated at the bar/counter which I typically don't care for but it was spacious and fun. Our drink and entree order was taken timely and came out within 15 minutes.\n\nI ordered an Irish Coffee w whiskey & whipped crenels which was excellent and heavy on the whiskey, so much so that I had to ask for a little more coffee to mellow it out, lol. I also tried the Bacon Bloody Mary (I had too! It looked so good and I love bloody Mary's). I was disappointed though because it was lacking the flavor and spice I look forward to. (There are much better Bloody Mary's in town - I will not order it again).\n\nThe dishes were ordered were the Cochon  Benedict and the Migas egg scramble. At first glance the dishes looked very incomplete and scarce,especially the Benedict - it just seemed like it was missing a side of fruit or something which would have made the plate more appealing. My husband said the Benedict was just okay (not great by any stretch) - the biscuit was dry and the pulled pork wasn't as flavorful as the menu suggested. The poached egg and the hollandaise were good and prepared well, but he won't order this dish again.\n\nI loved the Migas scramble and will order it again & again! It was fluffy, spicy and full of flavor. I especially liked the sour cream sauce it came with. I wish it would've had at least half an avocado instead of the two small slivers and maybe some toast. In hindsight, I should have ordered toast or a pancake with it to make it complete. It was still delicious and very filling.\n\nI recommend checking this place out.

The biscuit was so perfectly fluffy with buttery flakey goodness. Plus you get to try a fried green tomato and grits (something relatively new for a Californian like me).\n\n3) The Bananas Foster ($11) is decadent and absolutely worth trying! The bread is outstanding alone, and the flamb\u00e9ed bananas and raisins complete the package. My boyfriend ordered it and we ended up sampling the savory from my Southern spread and the sweet from his.\n\nI thought the quality of the food matched the prices.

Lol. \n\nEggs Cochon - the biscuit was very flaky and buttery, the pork was very tender with lots of flavor, the egg was fried to perfection (I don't like poached eggs) land the hollandaise was creamy and cheesy. \n\nBananas Foster - the bread was soft and fresh, there were a lot of raisins but very few bananas; however, the rum sauce was very nice, it was thick with a little cinnamon and nutmeg flavor, yum!.  And it came with two slices of bacon on the side.  The bacon was nice and crispy just like I like it.\n\nI also ordered a mimosa and asked for more champagne that OJ and our waitress informed me it is a double mimosa but she would make it a triple! And at no additional charge! She made a new friend that day...lol. It was great!.  \n\nMy other friend ordered a short stack of buttermilk pancakes (2/$7) which were golden brown and fluffy. She really enjoyed them.  And the other had the Gulf Fish St. Peter ($15).  The presentation was awesome and the smell was even better.  She killed that plate! So I guess it was good.  \n\nI would recommend this restaurant to everyone, all ages were represented and seemed to be happy with their food.  Lots of smiles could be seen and laughter to be heard.", "date": "2016-04-07 19:00:44"}

Great service, great food....Unfortunately one day I had a horrible service experience at this CBD location. I know (or thought I knew) how the seating worked. There was no line of people waiting outside to be seated. When I came in the hostess had just left from her station to seat a family of 5. I saw several empty seats at the bar so I went ahead and seated myself. I sat there for almost 3 minutes with no acknowledgement from either of the two workers behind the bar. There was a guy that seemed pretty busy but there was a woman who appeared to be free. I managed to make eye contact with her, she came over, I asked her for a menu she told me I would have to be seated by the hostess...I would have to get up from a row of empty seats, walk back to the welcome booth and ask to be seated?!?\n\nI did so....The hostess apologized and stated I could have stayed put as there was no one waiting to be seated. While waiting to be acknowledged (again) another patron came in and made the same \"mistake\" as me by just sitting at the bar. The rude server also instructed them to see the hostess to be seated, their response \"I have to ask to be seated at the bar???\". After the person got up, she rolled her eyes and began complaining to seated customers about how she has to \"answer that kind of question all day\" and how \"people think they can just sit wherever they want\". I was looking dead in her eyes in disgust. How dare you complain about customers!!! There was NO LINE. I'd understand if it was a busy time of the day. The rudeness was just uncalled for. I placed my order with the order server at the bar (luckily) and had pretty good service from him throughout my short meal. The rude server picked up my check (rolls eyes) and did not utter a \"Thank You\" or \"Have a Nice Day\". I won't be returning to this location, I don't care how much I'm craving RS while in the area, no thanks!!!", "date": "2016-04-07 20:47:14"}

I also ordered the candied bacon as an addition.  FGT- the tomato itself was perfect but it was heavily breaded, and not fried to crisp and I believe these may have been frozen because they were not hot and cool in center. Bacon was delicious but 2 very skinny slices so I would just say not as generous as I would have liked.  Biscuit was huge and perfect.\nSide note- a couple of locals (meaning a young couple - she from east bank and he from west bank) were seated next to me about 5 minutes after I was seated.  ( at bar) they were very friendly and were the folks that make you want to come back.  The kid - he was 27 - helped himself to my cheese from the omelet, friend green tomato and was just as generous with his food to me.  Without my knowing they paid for my breakfast.

I am always hesitant to try a place that has multiple locations over a place that stands all on its own, but this place absolutely smashed that rule. \n\nThe first thing that really impressed me about the Ruby Slipper was how genuine and friendly the staff all seemed to be. They all were very busy but completely hustling to take care of people. It was sort of a team effort; multiple servers topped off our coffee & water, cleared plates, etc. I think it says a LOT about a hospitality crew when they all work together like that! \n\nNext up: the beverages. When in NOLA... Well let's just say they go all out with their bloody Mary's. We're talking whole huge strips of bacon, large pieces of lemon and lime, whole veggies pieces... It's like a salad in a boozy, tomato-y cup. Also, the coffee was darn impressive for diner coffee! \n\nWe had the salmon benedict breakfast and the country breakfast. Both were outstanding. And the biscuits.... Ugh, the biscuits. They have absolutely ruined all other biscuits for me. They were just the perfect amount of dense, yet fluffy. Flaky, yet moist. Buttery, but not at all greasy. Just off the charts great biscuits. The grits were super tasty as well with good corn flavor, and not too mushy or sticky. My eggs were cooked exactly how I ordered them, which almost never happens because I have an oddly specific order that most chefs just can't or won't do: 'over hard, fried, dead, browned, solid, cooked all the way through'. Sorry, but that's how I like them! The ruby slipper nailed it. I finished my eggs for the first time in I can't remember how long. Yay! The salmon benedict was just bursting with meaty chunks of smoked-in-house salmon. Really, really nicely done. \n\nLastly - for this incredible breakfast experience, the price was very reasonable! About $30 all in for the two of us. \n\nI absolutely will go back any time I'm in NOLA and can't recommend this place highly enough!!", "date": "2016-05-14 03:45:22"}

It's obvious that this place has a ton of business knowing that as soon as I walked in, practically every table was filled! The place has sort of a classic feel, you have your bar, booths, and numerous tables made out of old wood. Sort of nostalgic if you ask me. Anyways, lets get onto the actual review.\n\nChicken St. Charles (4.5/5)\n\nThere's always something so satisfying about eggs when it comes to breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The fact that it adds consistency in flavor and texture is the reason why this was the perfect combination with the fried, crispy chicken breast placed on top of a warm buttery biscuit. I always save the yolk for last, and tend to eat around it until there's only the last bit of food left. So, as I placed my fork into the egg white and got a small bite of the chicken, biscuit, and egg together, my mind was definitely blown. I guess you could say I had got so used to seeing \"Shrimp & Grits\" on every menu, this was refreshing for me. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the biscuit was soft, crispy and golden. Once I got down to the last piece of the Chicken St. Charles, the yolk was still sitting on top of the piece of chicken which I carefully placed my fork into. The yolk ran over the chicken and piece of biscuit just like a waterfall in Hawaii. \n\nThat one bite was heaven. It was it. Paradise. Cue mic drop. \n\nBanana's Foster Pain Perdu (4/5)\n\nNothing really too different from your regular Banana's foster. The french toast was moist, and the distribution of the sauce was perfect. I liked the fact that they used fresh slices of banana on top of the french toast, other then that, not too mind blowing.\n\nIn conclusion, the experience was nice, but I certainly think that the one thing which separates the Ruby Slipper from any other breakfast place is their signature benedicts. So, if you do decide to go there, don't pass them up!", "date": "2016-05-26 21:36:14"}

Seated at the bar, the never-ending blur of activity that turned out to be the bartenders/servers extraordinaire greeted us and immediately made me homesick to move back home to LA. \nAnd then the morning went due south. While waiting just shy of an hour for our breakfast, we saw and heard our servers get repeatedly jerked around and lied to as they were told our order, and many others for those seated at the bar, were \"on their way,\" \"the very next ticket,\" & \"just waiting on 1 thing.\" No food came out for any of us. Then, after visiting with every one that had food and dodging everyone that had been waiting, the manager came to apologize (Good!) and let us know that our food was \"on its way\" and \"the very next ticket\" (No, that's not going to work after the \"almost an hour\" range). We left, mildly hungry, and royally pissed that they treated their staff that way. \nI'd like to think this was a blip on the radar. I've worked as a server and a bartender over several years in the past, and few things suck as much as the BOH making a mistake, not owning up to it, and leaving the servers baffled, standing around, not especially eager or able to help their hangry customers. And then for the MOD to try to keep up the pretense can feel like a punch to the gut. I've heard the food is really good. Maybe I'll find out some time. And hopefully the next time there's a mistake, the servers and bartenders will be given an explanation that's a little more straightforward.", "date": "2016-06-16 01:46:52"}

Just cool little spots. \nIt is known for a few things, one of which is the unique and amazing eggs benedict they have. There was a fried chicken breast, a salmon, a debris-pork type....and I can't remember the rest, but ALL of them were awesome. Because you get two, they let you mix and make so the BF and I got to try 4. I don't think I could pick a favorite but I think the BF liked the salmon the best. They range between 13-15 dollars, which may sound a little steep to some, but it was a mountain of food. Both time the BF and I spilt one order. $15 for a breakfast is more than worth it. We got potatoes and fried green tomatoes, and even though they weren't anything fancy, we both remarked at how good the potatoes were. Really, everything was fantastic. I could have drank a vat of the hollandaise sauce with a straw it was so good!

Decent sized shrimp, a perfect blend of herbs, spices, and grits that were perfect in texture!\n\nMy kids ordered the French toast and candied bacon. The serving size was HUGE.

WTH is this? At first, I wanted this, but since P ordered it, I didn't want to get the same thing and I was a bit jealous, but after tasting it, we both were like whomp whomp.\n\nEGGS COCHON - Slow-cooked, apple-braised pork debris served over a buttermilk biscuit, \ntopped with two poached eggs, finished with hollandaise.\nOkay, why is this a popular dish? It wasn't good, I don't know what the hell I am eating here.\n\nCHICKEN ST. CHARLES - Fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped\nwith two poached eggs, finished with a pork tasso cream sauce\nThis was another restaurant favourite and again, why? The chicken is dry and the biscuits are the worst biscuits I ever had in the South. This is blasphemy. I couldn't even eat the biscuits...they were hard as a rock.\n\nHOT-SMOKED SALMON BENNIE - Salmon hot-smoked in-house served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with red onion, flash-fried capers & dill hollandaise\nOkay, before I even ordered my meal, I was in between what I wanted. I wasn't sure if I should get specialties or the Benedict. When I finally decided just to go with the Peacemaker,, I asked the waitress SPECIFICALLY if I should do the Smoked Salmon, Corn Beef or the Eggs Blackstone. She said, do the Smoked Salmon.\nWhen my dish arrived, I noticed my Smoked Salmon was not smoked at all. It was like a regular cooked salmon, which I hate eating and so I called the waitress over. I said this isn't smoked salmon and she replied, we don't have smoked salmon.\nYes, my bad for overlooking the pre-fix word \"HOT\", but since I didn't even know it was hot, I kept saying Smoked Salmon to this waitress and she even repeated back to me the same thing, SMOKED SALMON. Why would you now say you don't have it? She could have corrected me and said Hot Smoked, but instead she used the same verbiage as me and Smoked Salmon is totally different than Hot Smoked Salmon.\nYeah, I definitely didn't enjoy this dish at all. Salmon is not done well - I can do regular cooked salmon if you have the skills to execute it properly, but this was not the case.\n\nYeah....nopes. I would definitely come back just for the pickled string beans.", "date": "2016-08-22 20:17:58"}

Although our food was great, our experience was completely ruined by a lack of professionalism by management. We ordered an Arnold Palmer drink, mimosas and a Bloody Mary. When the Arnold Palmer arrived at the table it had two ice cubes in it as if had been left sitting at the bar for 30 minutes. We pointed it out to the waitress who politely said she would get the manager. The manager, Raffeal, came over to the table and said there was nothing wrong with our drink that's just the way they look. At that point we asked for the drink to be removed from the table and for him to get us another drink at which he refused and said our policy is not to remove drinks from a table. So he left the watered down drink at our table throughout the entire meal. When we were presented with the bill, that same drink now was on our check, even though the drink was never even touched. When we asked to speak to Raffeal again he became combative, disrespectful and threatened to have us removed from the restaurant because we complained about the drink. Had I not watched the table next to us complain about their food and this same manager swiftly remove their entrees and replace them with new ones then I would be more inclined to believe the policy. Another manager stepped in and removed the drink from the check but we never should have been treated the way we were by Raffeal.

I admit I got lost but what matters is that I found the place. \n\nFirst thing I saw was the freaking line outside.  Since it just me, I didnt think it would be a problem getting a table. 45-minutes later, I sat at the bar.  To say this place was busy is an under statement!

Of course a family here and there.  Lucky for me they sat me next to another lone woman. After scrolling through the menu and looking at what others were getting, I decided on Gulf Fish St. Peter.  Everything about that dish was freaking amazing. My tastebud was having party at each bite.  Fish and shimp was soft/tender combined with the crunchiness of the grit cake was texture heaven.

While there are multiple locations in New Orleans, I went to the Magazine St. location as it was closest to my conference hotel.\n\nOur group of 2 (yes, tiny I know) was promptly sat and we were greeted in seconds by our server Sommer. I'm not a morning person, like at all, so breakfast at 7:15am is more like torture, but our server was so polite and bubbly, it totally set the mood! She quickly got our our coffees and was totally able to read body cues when we were ready to order food. \n\nI personally had the Peacemaker. I think the Peacemaker was created for people like myself who consider ourselves foodies, but we can't make a damn decision. In essence, the Peacemaker allows you to pick 2 eggs benedict option out of the 8 total options they offer. So one half of my eggs benedict was called the Eggs Cochon (pronounced koe-shawn) and the other half was called the Shrimp Boogaloo. The eggs cochan was delicious, and started with half of a biscuit, shredded pork, a poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. While it was quite tasty, my taste buds exploded when I had the Shrimp Boogaloo! It consisted of shrimp cooked in/with pork and tomato, a fried green tomato, a poached egg, and a delicious buttery, tomato sauce all over a buttermilk biscuit! It was savory, rich, but not overwhelming, and had the perfect amount of seasoning! And I think what really sold it was the fried green tomato!! The fried part didn't fall off when you cut it, and had just the perfect amount of tartness that complemented the richness of the dish. WHO KNEW A GREEN VEGGIE COULD PACK A PUNCH???!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I was a really happy person! The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 stars was because the hostesses seemed more concerned about texting or talking among themselves rather than helping us right when we entered, but then again it was 7 in the morning. It would be hard for me to be super attentive at such an ungodly hour.", "date": "2016-11-05 19:38:49"}

The line can get long so try to get there early. The earlier the better. This is one of the best breakfast spots in NOLA so expect lines if you don't come early. They do a great job of getting the food out so you should be seated in 40 mins or so regardless. So just walk around and they will give you a call/text.\n\nOk so what to try:\n-The first day I tried one of their signature benedicts. Absolutely delicious. You can either just get one or try multiple benedicts. I tried the salmon, corned hash and the chicken St.. Charles. \n-The buttermilk pancakes are really amazing as well. I tried the banana pecan and my god it was good. \n\nCan't wait to be back here!", "date": "2016-11-06 00:37:28"}

We removed the over cooked eggs with the sauce on it and after waiting for a while, our dish became less appetizing. When the poached eggs came, we asked for extra hollandiase  sauce. He never brought it out even though we waited for like 10 minutes. Our benedicts got cold and dry so we just picked at it. \n\nOur server a asked us if anyone brought out Hollandaise sauce for us and when we said to forget about it (because it took so long) he already had our check ready in his hand.

I simply wanted 2 egg whites and 1 full eggs. My mom also wanted her eggs cooked over medium well (just a little runny egg yolk). They were unable to accomodate either. Rather, they were unwilling to. \n\nOnce the food arrived, neither of us were impressed. I was so disappointed because the reviews were awesome. My mothers eggs were too hard, her fried green tomato was unseasoned. The only redeeming quality was the Ruby Sunrise.\n\nNow, to my surprise the guy next toe noticed me typing my review and asked that i add the wait to get your bill. He mentioned others around us who were seated after us had their bills AND had left. Even as i am writing this, i am waiting for the server to take my payment and EVERYONE who was seated after us (with 10-15 mins) have ALL left.\n\nUnfortunately, i must rate my experience as a 1 star.

I love being in Nawlins for bloody mary's because they usually add either a shrimp, a crawfish or something pickled such as okra or green beans to the drink. Additionally, the tomato base is always on point!! I was NOT disappointed. My linesisters ordered the peach bellini. They weren't that fond of their drinks and thought it to be syrupy. I tasted it and... it tasted like.. a bellini LOL. They changed to a mimosa instead and were satisfied. I order the gulf fish dish. It came over a grit cake with a hollaindaise cream as well. It was good but not the explosion of flavors that I am used to receiving in NOLA. My line sister ordered a side of a grit cake but was given cheese grits instead. Somehow something got lost in translation during the ordering and the server informed us that they don't provide the grit cakes a la carte. Whatttttt? Oh my, if I can make one suggestion, add the grit cake to the a la carte menu or offer as a side.\n\nIt was a busy Sunday afternoon so service was slow but actually a lil slower than I would have liked but hey, I had my bloody mary.

Another 5 minutes pass, he says I haven't forgotten you and again walks away again. No water, no drink order, nothing. By this time I'm frustrated. He finally comes to our table and tries to apologize but it was too late. The sad part is that he was attending to a table right beside us. All he had to do was take our order.

That way when you get there, you might only wait 3 - 5 min to get a table!\n2) The RS makes their own biscuits, & they're incredible.  Huge & fluffy.  IMO, the buttermilk biscuits are reason enough to visit this restaurant.  \n3) If you love Eggs Benedict (and who doesn't?), Ruby Slipper is the place to get it.  Perfect poached eggs are challenging for any kitchen, as is a good Hollandaise sauce, so it's always a pleasant surprise to find a place that gets them right.  The Ruby Slipper takes it a step further, though.  Instead of using English muffins for the base, they use those heavenly biscuits I mentioned.  Next, they offer 6 deliciously creative takes on the classic EB.  Here's the best part: can't decide on just one? No problem.  They have a 7th option called The Peacemaker; pick two, & they'll put one of each on the plate.  How's that for service?  I had the Eggs Cochon EB & the Chicken St. Charles EB, & both were absolutely incredible.  The fried chicken was crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside...details, details, details.  The apple-braised pork debris on the Eggs Cochon was to die for.  I regret not ordering a pound of it to take home.  FYI: \"Debris\" a term used in Creole & Cajun cooking to refer to a braised meat. Best known for use in a hot po-boy sandwich, RS has used it here in an EB, and it's out-of-sight.\n\nMy dining companions ordered a florentine omelette (gigantic), a biscuit, and the Bananas Foster French Toast respectively - all were hits.\n\nDo yourself a favor & make Ruby Slipper one of your breakfasts on you next visit to the French Quarter.", "date": "2016-12-24 19:09:05"}

One son ordered a croque madame, which he devoured even though he's not much of an egg person. The other ordered a Louisianne omelette, which is a shrimp and thyme omelette. I think he ate the shrimp out of it when he started getting full. Can't blame him. It also included an excellent pancake, half of which I stole. \n\nI think I ordered best: they have several takes on the traditional Eggs Benedict, and I couldn't decide between the Benedict Cochon (a barbecue version) and the Blackstone (a bacon and grilled tomato version). Fortunately, you can order a \"Peace Maker,\" which allows you to have one of each. It turned out to be a good combo. \n\nThe Eggs Blackstone has a terrifically crisp tomato, which may be the best use of a tomato I have ever experienced. I don't even like tomatoes much. Add in some perfectly cooked bacon and a poached egg, and it was a taste that made me feel smarter for ordering it. \n\nBut, being in New Orleans, there was a decadent side that I just couldn't resist. That Eggs Cochon (French for pig) should probably give you a hangover if there were such a thing as food karma. It was wonderfully rich and flavorful and chewy and had just the right density. I had to force myself to quit eating it a couple times so I would have time to enjoy it. Now that I'm writing about it, I may have to go back tomorrow for more. \n\nCoffee was nice and strong, as coffee in New Orleans tends to be. There's no need for a Starbucks here - I don't think I've seen one, now that I think of it. The coffee all over town is better and less expensive than Starbucks anyway. Have a couple cups so you avoid the temptation to lapse into a food coma after your dining experience. \n\nYeah, I've definitely talked myself into going back tomorrow.", "date": "2017-01-04 06:02:33"}

When I checked in with the hostess, she told me she would text me when my table was ready. After not being texted for some time, I went back over and just waited outside. I could see that NO ONE was getting texted, instead, they were just yelling names. When they yelled my name, I heard another patron say that I had been called a long time ago, but yet, I NEVER received a text. If you don't plan on texting people when their party is ready, just tell them to wait around and they will be called. Simple.\n\nOn this visit, I initially tried the french toast logs or whatever they are called. WAY too much sugar. Then I switched and tried the steel oats. My mother tried the southern breakfast.

Excellent choice! One of the best Bloody Mary's I had! The  Bloody Mary mix is made in house, perfectly balanced...salty, spicy, tangy...pretty much how an excellent Bloody Mary should taste, topped with a piece of Bacon! BACON!!! \n\nI got the Gulf Fish 'St. Peter' - The fish of the day was a Big Red Drum also called  Channel Bass, Redfish, Spottail Bass, or simply Red (Information was from Jacob...free of charge). Its a local Atlantic fish, which happened to be exactly what I was looking for...something local. The Pan Seared Fish was excellent, light flakey perfectly complimented by the mustard sauce. I only wish the piece of fish was a bit more generous. Never had a Cheesy Grit cake before, this was something foreign to me...tasted like a lighter hash-brown, the inside was softer.\n\nMy buddy got the BBQ Shrimp & Grits. I got to sneak a taste of his dish. This was simply amazing...pretty much perfection! This is exactly how I pictured Shrimp & Grits in my head. Fresh local plump and juicy saut\u00e9ed gulf shrimp with creamy flavorful grits! Yaassss!

Most of their menu consists of those amazingly delicious, gut wrecking, artery clogging amazingness (think biscuits, gravy, sauces, fried, and butter). Then, to give it their own unique take on things they add a creole flair to it. For us this meant adding shrimp and andouille sausage to the eggs Benedict and stuffing the french toast with a pineapple cream cheese concoction.\n\nWe went here for our final breakfast in NOLA and I feel like that was the best time we could have gone. The breakfast was very heavy and we spent the next few hours walking around the city burning off the breakfast. Heavy DOES NOT equate to bad in any way, in fact the food was delicious. What it means is that you definitely wouldn't want to eat here each day, and you probably wouldn't want to eat here and then sit for a long time, unless you want to fall into a food coma LOL. \n\nI really enjoyed their unique take on breakfast items but would definitely hold off on visits for days I either really need some comfort food or when I need to only eat 1 meal that day.", "date": "2017-01-26 22:07:30"}

I figured I give this place a try.\n\nI ordered  all 3 of their signature items.\n\nEggs Cochon (2/5) - Biscuit was surprisingly amazing, but the protein was lacking salt.\n\nChicken St. Charles (3.5/5) - Biscuit was amazing again. And again, the chicken could use more seasoning\n\nBBQ Shrimp& Grits - (1.5/5) - Shrimp&grits is a sensitive topic only for me because i'm always looking for the best in New Orleans. Currently Surrey's hold the title and still does. Ruby Slippers version is just a little to watery for me. Although a friend of my preferred their grit texture to be more creamy than Surrey's version.\n\nBananas Foster - I won't give this a rating because all you have to do is make sure it's sweet and fattening. Nailed it.\n\nI will say this. They use the same biscuit for every dish. Their biscuit is ABSOLUTELY amazing. It was the star on the plates that had biscuits.  \n\nThe service was standard given that it was busy. Be mindful that you have to have a full party in order to be sat. \n\nWill I ever come back?

We only had two mornings in New Orleans, going to Ruby Slipper on the first morning and one of their competitors on the second morning.  After our second breakfast, we deeply regretted not just going back to Ruby Slipper.  If/when we go back to New Orleans, I more than half expect that we'll just go to Ruby Slipper every morning.\n\nMy wife had the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu, which was a big hit.  I was going to order one of their Bennies.  They have a bunch of these, consisting of buttermilk biscuits, topped with poached eggs, some kind of delicious meat (corned beef, pork debris, fried chicken, ...), and some kind of sauce (hollandaise, pork tasso cream sauce, horseradish cream, ...).  I was planning to order the Corned Beef Bennie, but the waitress suggested the \"Peacemaker\" instead, which is one biscuit each of two different bennies, instead of two of the same kind.  I'm glad she did.  I enjoyed the Corned Beef Bennie but I liked my other bennie even more, the Chicken St Charles, with fried chicken.\n\nFinally, I had seen many warnings about the wait.  We went on a Friday morning.  They opened at 7 and we arrived at about 8:15.  To my surprise, there were still plenty of tables available and we were seated immediately.  By the time we left, about an hour later, there was a small crowd waiting outside, but that crowd seemed to be growing as we watched.", "date": "2017-03-25 22:05:16"}

Food wise you really can't go wrong, the biscuits are out of this world, DELICIOUS.  I had the southern breakfast and everything about this dish was complete perfection, eggs, grits, fried green tomato, and applewood smoked bacon.  This was my favorite breakfast spot during my weekend in NOLA.", "date": "2017-04-28 03:20:53"}

They food always comes out amazing and I come here 4/5 times a year, for the past 3 years. I have not had anything but awesome experiences and that's what keeps me coming back. I've hit this place three times this trip and 2 out of the 3 times Jacus has been my server. I used to manage a restaurant and I would have fought to have a full wait stay as attentive and knowledgeable as Jacus, he remembered us, knew what I had two days earlier and even convinced me to get something else too even though I wasn't sure I wanted to try it. He was spot on, the special was wonderful and I thanked him for pushing it!! If your in the NOLA area get in to the Ruby Slipper, I've tried the other locations and this one on Magazine St is the best, fight the wait or come early and ask for Jacus, if you do these things you can't go wrong for Breakfast or brunch... thanks again Ruby Slipper and I'll see y'all next trip!!", "date": "2017-04-30 19:40:44"}

My friend and I came here on our trip to New Orleans when we saw the high reviews. However, neither of us loved our meals. I got an omelette while my friend got the cochon Benedict. My omelette was fine but nothing special. The potatoes it came with were on the bland side and the biscuit was a little too floury and lacked salt. I stole a bite of my friend's dish and thought it was bland. It could have used a salsa verde or something to accompany the pork. In fact, my friend had to get extra hollandaise sauce to add more flavor to the dish. The service was good and our waitress could not have been nicer. However, I would not come back here and would check somewhere else out for brunch instead", "date": "2017-05-31 04:47:09"}

The girls who worked at the bar and who took our order didn't downgrade their passion and smile because of how busy they're. The wait for our food was a bit long but I didn't really mind because I was sipping the best peach Bellini. Then as the food finally came we were completely blown away.

We walked by the day before and the lines were pretty crazy...so we were glad for the timing.\n\nWe opted for first available seating, so for our party of 2, we got seated at the bar.\n\nhad the bacon bloody mary, which came with green beans and olives...had a really strong kick, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was like a meal in an alcoholic drink, with the bacon and veggies....bacon BM's seem to be pretty popular in the area and I gotta say that this one was pretty good.  Asked for some extra olives, cuz I love me some olives with my drank, and they happily speared 4 for me.  :) PLUS on that.\n\nAlso had the signature eggs benny...you have different ones to choose from, and if you can't decide, you can go with the peacemaker and choose two...we got the cochon (pulled pork) and the traditional bacon and eggs benny.  Wifey had a really awesome blueberry sweet pancakes...I think that's what it was called, it might have been fruit-filled sweet pancakes and blueberry was the choice this time around...but our bartender recommended it...wifey and i LOVED it!  As well as the eggs benny...prob would've ventured out a little further on the 2nd choice, but it was pretty good still).  \n\nService - The place got pretty busy after we got seated and we didn't get the pressure from our server to move quickly like some other reviewers mentioned, there was enough turnover and we never felt rushed.  In fact, we had pleasant convo's with our neighbors to the right and left of us, as well as our bartender.  Maybe it's just my winning personality (joke joke, it's the wifey who has that) that prevented that from happening.  But overall, all the servers were quite friendly.\n\nDefinitely touristy, but I guess there's a reason why...if you're a tourist, you typically go to the places that everyone else goes to...but you can avoid the crowds by coming early enough I think.  I also think there's another one in the area, but we wanted to go to this one, esp because it was close to where we needed to go next.  I could see that sitting with a fairly large group might incur long wait times...but again, I think that can be worked around.  \n\nBut for what we had, I would definitely come back here.", "date": "2017-06-01 22:00:10"}

My first time in New Orleans, I skipped Ruby Slipper because their line was crazy long. I was pleasantly surprised when my coworker friends called and said they were seated promptly, menus in hand. It was a less busy time of the morning. \n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by the hosts and let them know that my party was already seated. I found my friends center of the dining room, I took a seat, and browsed the menu. \n\nTheir server approached the table and quickly informed me that \"there are no joiners.\" She repeated this line several times before I realized what she meant. I said, \"Ok. That's fine.\" I smiled passive-aggressively and proceeded to find loopholes to this ridiculous rule. (I thought, surely she doesn't expect me to just sit here and watch my friends eat). I ordered at the bar and clumsily walked back and forth from the bar to my friends' table. \n\nAnother server brought my food from the kitchen. He explained the \"no joiners\" rule, which is in place to to minimize confusion on their busier mornings. My friends' server continued to check on my friends, but she did not look at me, ask how my food was, did not ask if she could bring anything. I didn't even get coffee or water. We had zero contact for the duration of breakfast.\n\nMy first impression of this restaurant was a server telling me no. She did not offer any solutions on how I could be served. It seemed like she might have look around, saw they weren't swamped, and thought of how she could have said \"yes\" that day.", "date": "2017-06-03 22:47:46"}

At this point no matter what the food taste like, I am completely turned off by the service and lack of hospitality!!", "date": "2017-06-30 18:44:23"}

Erin said, \"I will be right back and I will sit down with you and go over the menu!\"  Sure enough she returned a couple minutes later and sat down with us. She made a few recommendations including splitting the eggs Benedict. We had the fried chicken eggs Benedict and the pork eggs Benedict along with French toast. Erin's recommendation was spot on. This was a very delicious breakfast. Erin had great customer service and a very cute sense of humor. I told her I was going to do a Yelp review.

As there is only one small bench outside to wait (forget about waiting inside, not gonna happen), Hubby suggested we take a short walk around the block. As I was already the gnarly kind of hungry, I made him stand there with me. I'm glad I did, because we were called in about half the time. \n\nWe were given the option to sit at a table or the bar, so we opted for the table, a high two-top next to the bar. We were quickly greeted by our server and our drink orders were taken. The Yelp Bloody Mary certificate was staring at me in the face, demanding that I order the Bacon-Infused Vodka Bloody Mary, so I did as I was told. \n\nOH.EM.GEE. The bacon bloody mary is SO good. Maybe the best bloody mary I have ever had. It has just the right amount of spice and topped with green beans, lime, olive, lemon, and of COURSE a strip of bacon (Note: No crappy celery stick). I could just drink these all day and be pretty damn happy. Be careful though, that sucker took a long time to creep up on me. I didn't feel it until I stood up to leave, but man, I felt it. Good thing I didn't order a second one!\n\nOur food came out in a fair amount of time. I was, and still am, a little sad that food was not very warm. More like warmish. I had the Eggs Cochon. The biscuit had the perfect texture and just the right size to not overwhelm the dish, the pork debris was sweet and delish underneath the egg, and the hollandaise sauce was divine. But it would have just been so much better if it came out hot. \n\nHubby had the Corned Beef Bennie. He also found much joy in the hollandaise sauce, but did comment that he maybe should have tried the chicken. I am not a big fan of corned beef, so I have no comment. \n\nThe service was friendly and wonderful. It was fun watching the bartender pour 17 quarts of vodka into a bucket for the bloody marys. \n\nWonderful spot for breakfast/brunch. Take warning, though, the food was so rich and filling that I was only able to finish one of my eggs cochon, but Hubby happily devoured the second one for me after he finished his. I was still full until dinner, so if you are on an eating tour, you will want to plan to share.", "date": "2017-07-02 19:40:52"}

No big deal, as we were able to grab cocktails to-go and walk around with a Bloody and Mimosa in tow.

We both opted for the \"Peacemaker\" Benny option, which allows you to get two different types for $15.  I got the fried chicken and the Rueben, while my date got the salmon and shrimp. All were great, with the fried chicken being the favorite between us.  The biscuits are the bomb, and I regret not ordering a few to walk around and eat.  Maybe later.  The drinks were great, with 3 different Bloody Mary options and a handful of Mimosa variations, in addition to Irish coffees and other adult drinks.  We sat at the bar to eat and I was amazed at just how much orange juice and champagne they went through in our time there.  \n\nAll in all, our service, food, and price point were great.

Like \"30 people standing outside on the sidewalk\" busy. The Ruby Slipper has a good-sized menu with lots of choices, from Southern specials to standard-fare pancakes and bacon. Our waitress Julie was excellent- one of the best waitresses I've had anywhere in a long time! I ordered coffee and the Bam Bam biscuit, which was fried eggs, pepper jack cheese, a fried green tomato and two strips of candied bacon on a huge biscuit. It was delicious - no fuss and good home-style cooking. My friend got the cinnamon swirl pancakes which were also delicious and a huge portion. If it had been later in the day I would've loved to have tried one of their mimosas, but sadly, although it was 5 o'clock somewhere, it was 9:30am here. I would definitely go back to the Ruby Slipper!", "date": "2017-07-14 12:27:08"}

We arrive when it said we should and we were immediate seated. Love this functionality so this get half a star (3.5)! \n\nWe ordered the shrimps & grits and the peacemaker which is pick 2 Eggs Bendict from the menu for 2 to share. We picked egg cochon and chicken St. Charles. Honestly, the peacemaker would've been enough for 2 to share!!\n\n- Shrimps & grits was good but don't think I would order this in general. It's almost like a rice porridge with shrimp and some sauce on it. I took a couple bites and was done but of course I don't like wasting food. I dipped it with the biscuit. \nThe peacemaker:\n- Egg cochon was delicious. poached egg was cooked just right and goes well with the pork! \n- Chicken St. Charles was the fried chicken and was just ok. I would suggest to add some hot sauce with this. \n- Big mimosa - Peach bellini $10 meh wasn't peachy at all   didn't enjoy this.

Sat at the large circular bar in the center\n\nThe food looked really good and from reviews and photos from other Yelp reviews, I was stuck between the Chicken St Charles and the Egg Cochon from the Eggs Benedict section on their menu.  I ultimately decided on the Egg Cochon, with the poached eggs lying on slow cooked pork and finished with their hollondaise sauce.  I did not regret it, and enjoyed the flavors as they melted together.  I even added some Southern Louisiana hot sauce and it was great.  You get 2 of them, so if you're not that hungry or want to try something else with someone, it's a good order to share.\n\nThe food was worth it, and I could see why there was a wait.

This is one of those places. First, they have an online wait list that tells you the time they think you'll be seated, which was super handy, as the last thing I want to do is hang out in a restaurant foyer waiting for my table. So the app told us it was a 46 minute wait, and we waited a good half hour before heading over there. My goodness, there were 100 or 150 people in front, waiting for their table. This place must be something. \nIt is.\nBecause it's New Orleans, you can get an alcoholic beverage right on the street in a to-go cup, so they had a person getting people cocktails. I had the Bloody Mary with bacon-infused vodka. Yes, bacon-infused vodka. It was as spectacular as you would imagine. \nWe sat at the bar when we were called, exactly at the time quoted. I don't know what kind of magic that online wait list works on, but it's something special. The bartender was super friendly, and gave us huge mugs of coffee. My wife ordered the shrimp and grits, and I had the Migas. The shrimp and grits were simply to die for. There was tremendous seafood flavor in the grits, and the shrimp were enormous, yet tender. The dish comes with a biscuit and some kind of sugar/honey butter. Fabulous. If you're hung over, this is the dish to eat (we were). \nAs for the Migas, I thought they were okay - not really a composed dish, rather it was a bunch of stuff I like that I had to kind of put together myself. I ordered wrong. I should have had one of their signature Benedicts, which my neighbor had. It looked like a work of art. Oh well, I guess I'll try one next time.", "date": "2017-10-17 19:38:00"}

Or maybe an idiot savant? So I am a visual guy. I actually DID use Yelp...and typed shrimp and Grits into the Yelp search menu. I then browsed pics of which places grits looked the best. As Andrew Zimern would say, \"if it looks good... eat it!\"\nBrowsing images of this place, I saw the shrimp and grits in that sculpted do-hickie bowl along with buttermilk biscuit. But it actually looked too Foo foo-e for me.  \n\nHowever having worked in the hotel til noon, I looked up at clock, Holy Guacamole! Famished I redid the \"shrimp and grits\" search and the Ruby Slipper showed up closest walking distance. Yep that's my lazy ass scientific search criteria. It wasn't til I was done eating that I bothered to read my fellow elites reviews; raving about the place. \n\nWhen I arrived walking down Magazine St,  I thought there was a street party as folks were hanging out with bloody Mary's in plastic cups and a strip of bacon as the swizzle stick. I Bogarted my way up to the front and a gorgeous young lady all 4'9\" of her asked if I wanted to sit at the bar. I was ok doing that. Then she started talking and I couldn't understand so I leaned down and she got mock mad at me for implying she was short and I couldn't hear her way up in 6 foot land. Short Stuff lead me to the bar and literally in 2 minutes I was seated. In another minute I had hot coffee and water and my order of shrimp and grits on its way. \n\nI then proceeded to search for \"Dubs\" tickets on line since they are playing the Hornets 2-nite (sorry ya'll, I can't bring myself to call them the P-bird word).\n\nThe bar is a great place to hang, catch up, make new friends, and score some hella good seats for a fraction of Oracle prices to see the Dubs!!! The waiter delivering my plate saw the section I was purchasing and said \"Score.. great seats\".\n\nThe shrimp plump and well seasoned the grits were no big thang except I like the rosemary they used to  season them. I'm totally steeling that idea! It's not like the grits were bad, they were perfectly cooked but pa-leeze when do you ever rave about toast or mashed potatoes? Only when they suck! Well these grits did not suck. \nThe biscuit was as big as an 8 month pregnant hockey puck but cutting into it was light, flakey and moist as a cloud. Great with some buttah and Honey. \n\nThe coffee was awesome; had two there, and my waiter hooked me up with a fresh cup to go. \n\nThe meal was uneventful except some dude in a Chiquita Banana outfit apparently delivered a banana-gram to someone in the restaurant. Also Short stuff stopped over to inform me two ladies wanted to speak to me. I told her to tell them I was her squeeze and to back off. That got a big hug from her. \n\nFeeling stuffed and accomplished that I scored Dubs tickets and likely saved $500-1000 smackers, I headed out coffee in hand and managed to get another big hug from short stuff on the way out as well. I assume that was the signal to whomever those ladies were to back off jack!", "date": "2017-10-20 19:35:37"}

This time around, I was super excited to make it out. I'm a sucker for eggs benedicts and the RSC has plenty for you to choose from. I had looked at the menu before even stepping in line. Oh... the line, even though Yelp tells you that there's no line... you'll be waiting at least 10 mins. I sat at the bar and ordered the Brandy Milk Punch which was light and delicious. For food, I had the stuffed cheesecake french toast that came with a side of bacon. Yaassss!! Give me some bacon! The french toast was not as sweet as most places so I was very happy with it. I couldn't decide between a few of the bennies so I opted for the \"Peace maker\" which allows you to choose two different eggs bennies. I chose the Chicken St. Charles and the Cochon. I didn't care for the chicken, it was just boring. Should've gone with the Shrimp Boogaloo ... fun to say and it looked amazing! The Cochon was reallly good. I would recommend the Cochon, for sure, it's pulled pork. The only thing I was kinda disappointed about was the eggs were overdone. \n\nThe staff was friendly and efficient which kept the place running like a well oiled machine especially with the traffic they get.\n\nIf you are traveling by yourself, definitely sit at the bar because there are so many people from all over the place!", "date": "2017-11-01 19:33:00"}

Our server Demetra who was very awesome gave us the low down on the good menu items as there were so many to choose from. She started us out with some Big Easy mimosas which were bigger than normal mimosas...more like 4 mimosas in one glass. I started out with the Ruby Slipper mimosa which is OJ + pomegranate...pretty good! Then I did the blood orange mimosa which was much better. \n\nNow onto the food!!!!\nI knew I probably was gonna go with the BBQ shrimp & grits, but Demetra did a great job of not letting me sway away from that idea. I was a little weary as some places don't do shrimp & grits well, but dammit this is Nawlins!!! Very good dish and a nice size! The shrimp were saut\u00e9ed along with an amber beer and rosemary reduction. The dish came along with a big ass biscuit.

The wonderful lady at the front desk told us to go to the Ruby Slipper Caf\u00e9, which happens to be right next door to our hotel.  I go to my trusty Yelp app and make a reservation although we were only 500 feet away from the restaurant.  We were greeted by the host that got my reservation and had a table ready for us.  We get seated and begin to review the menu the waitress suggested we try a variety of eggs Benedict that they have.  We both opted to go with the Peacemaker which lets you choose two signature eggs Benedict.  I ordered the Eggs Cochon, the Chicken St. Charles, a side of cheese grits and a Peach Bellini to make my brunch just a little better.  After my friend and I shared some stories and a drink our food came right out.  The presentation of the food had my mouth watering.  The Chicken St. Charles Benedict was a warm biscuit topped with a fried boneless chicken breast, a poached egg and a cream sauce.  My favorite of the day is the Eggs Cochon Benedict also served on a butter milk biscuit, topped with pulled pork, a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. Talk about Heaven all on one plate!!!  If you are a grits fan then you must try the grits with the pepper-jack cheese, just trust me! The food was made with love, the biscuits were moist, the chicken was season and cooked just right and the pork was slow cooked to perfection!  If you are not hungry just from that description I do not know what to tell you!!  Ruby Slipper Caf\u00e9 turned me into a fan quick because I ended up coming back the next day for brunch.

If you need to know how good all of this was, just know that when we went back on Sunday we had the exact same meal -- and I would order it again and again in a heartbeat!  I can't believe I have been coming to NOLA for 30+ years and have never tried this restaurant before now.  Part of that was that it always had a huge line and I didn't want to wait, but now with being able to add your name to the waitlist, there is no reason not to go.", "date": "2017-12-06 22:20:09"}

The house cooked smoked salmon is meaty and tender, with crispy capers, the ideal poached egg and just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. I recall that it is a very rich dish so I would  balance it out with  the fried chicken bennie.  A few dashes of self imposed hot sauce and I was all set. In the end, I wanted to try something else\n but again, I was Not disappointed woth my cave. In-fact, I believe that my over all experience at Ruby Slipper might just make me a better person over all. I left feeling upbeat and more positive about the human race.  It could be the simple things in life- a delicious meal, lively, friendly, diligent service from all the servers especially Brandy or from the friends we made in the rest room and at neighboring tables.

We used the yelp waitlist and were able to walk in without an issue. If you're in a party of 3 or less, just go ahead and take a bar seat. It's very open concept and WORTH it. You'll get better conversation with the bartenders, your drinks (alcoholic or nonalcoholic) will come out faster, and there are three TVs hanging strategically so you can watch the games from any position at the bar. Also the noise level was lower at the bar than the floor seats. \n\nThe food: \n  We got The Trifecta and The Skinny Florentine. The Skinny Florentine tasted extremely light, save the healthy portion of goat cheese in the middle otherwise a very good omelette. The Trifecta was chicken Benedict, pulled pork Benedict, and a shrimp Benedict. In my personal opinion, the chicken was the best tasting one, although two out of three eggs were over cooked and the pulled pork was a little dry. The bottoms of the benedicts were biscuits instead of English muffins, so they have the potential to be a very thick dish. However, as far as the eggs, people sitting near us got perfectly cooked eggs on their Benedicts, so it was probably just a mistake. \n\nThe service: \n They were military friendly, extremely attentive, answered all our questions, and made small talk that was inviting. Ended up getting a discount and several dinner recommendations from our server. \n\n4.5 out of 5, would definitely come here again!", "date": "2017-12-24 19:00:41"}

We had a high top table in the back of the restaurant close to the restroom, but it honestly was far enough away to not be a problem.\n\nWe ordered the trifecta, the chicken benedict, and the chicken sandwich.   Everything had such great flavor -- the trifecta had a selection of chicken, pork, and shrimp on the benedicts, the chicken sandwich had a cajun slaw included. The chicken sandwich was tasty, but the piece of chicken was quite large it made it difficult at times to bite because the tomato kept slipping from between the bread. The chicken benedict order needed a bit more hollandaise sauce, but the fact they served it on biscuits was wonderful. \n\nThe waitress was really sweet, but she was extremely busy so she did not check in on us too often. My friend wanted to get an extra order of hollandaise sauce, but it was impossible because the waitress never came back. The place was always crowded when we passed so it's not surprising that this was the case, but we did notice other waiters were more available to their tables. \n\nIf you're staying on Canal St., I suggest stopping by, but don't count out other breakfast spots in the area which are just as good.", "date": "2018-01-11 12:01:32"}

We got to our table and our waiter Devin (Devon, Devan?) was the best. He was very helpful with navigating the menu when everything looks so yummy. The food was so good and it was served timely, hot, and correct. With it being so busy- it is easy to make excuses about why the quality will decline so when it came out perfect, we were impressed. I got the banana fosters French toast with the candied bacon. It was so great! The portion was huge. I had lots to share with the group which was so great because I don't share well. Haha The other items we got was the Trifecta, Peacemaker (Chicken St. Charles, Salmon Bennie), and another Peacemaker (Salmon Bennie, Eggs Blackstone). They all enjoyed their Benedicts!

Nice, loud ambiance and had the southern type of charm. Service was good. I ordered the cochon Benedict (it think that's what it was called, it had the pork debris) and Benedict with the fried chicken. Unfortunately mine barely had any of the sauces that were supposed to be \"smothered\" on top of it. The pork debris tasted great, but unfortunately the chicken was underwhelming. Both of the biscuits that they were on were good but not great. And the egg was poached very nicely to a medium.  My wife had the BLT but asked for a fried egg instead of the bacon because she does not eat pork. She felt the bread was too thick for what was inside of the sandwich. And looking at the bread, I felt the same way. But again, who orders a BLT with an egg and no bacon?? Haha. The iced coffee was nice and strong and tasted delicious, according to my wife. I don't drink enough coffee to really have a great opinion. But tasting it, it did taste delicious to me. Strong, sweet and a nice aromatic, crisp taste. I feel they prob just were running low on the sauce and was unable to smother mine. Or at least I hope that's the case. THe lack of sauce didn't give me the \"all warm inside\" feeling that southern food and Benedict's give you. It was unfortunate because I saw the guy next to me get the same things and his Benedict's were oozing with sauce =(. Service was really good and food came out in a timely manner. Yelp came clutch with letting us book a table so we didn't have to wait in the rain forever. This place has all the potential but didn't quite meet the hype it was given when we were served. If they have me enough sauce and the fried chicken wasn't thin and didn't taste slightly over cooked I would've Gave this place a 4 or four and a half star rating. Just constructive criticism. Sorry ruby slippers! I know y'all work hard to protect your reputation and I'm not trying to bash that. Just feel I got slighted on my food. Maybe it was my fault for not asking for more sauce.", "date": "2018-01-30 05:03:05"}

I find that most bloody Mary's tend to either be under seasoned, too watery, or too cold. But this one suffered from none of those. It had a thick consistency, and the perfect blend of spicing, pepper and horseradish, as well as taking compliments from a rasher of bacon, pickled dilly bean and olive. Seriously tasty, and you also get a choice for it to be made with either normal or bacon vodka. Rave reviews and we're only at the drink!\n\nFoodwise, like I mentioned, it's Cajun classics fused with Brunch. Think blackened shrimp Benedict, red beans and rice hash, and pulled pork stuffed omelette.

My group (table of 6) waited for 12 minutes before our server even came over to ask if we wanted drinks. Some of us ordered Bloody Mary's and some ordered coffee. We then waited for her to come back and get our food order. About 20 minutes later, she comes back saying she forgot to put in the coffee order, so it'll be a few minutes. At that point, we worried she'd forgotten to put in our food as tables around us were seated after us but fed before. We then ask her and SURPRISE SURPRISE, she's forgotten to put in our order. I spoke to two managers, a white woman and a tall black guy. They came by, were polite and asked to wait 10-15 min for our food and were comp'ing our meal. We waited 25 minutes before our food came.

If you are going to go I would go early- there doesn't seem to be a slow time based on what we saw.\n\nThe food was good- not the best we had in NOLA by a long shot but perfectly fine. My husband got 2 different types of eggs Benedict and he loved it, I had the cajun ruben which tasted like every other ok ruben I have had- didn't taste anything cajun at all.\n\nService was good. It was very busy but our waiter stayed on top of things. Overall, for the people waiting more than 1 hr for this place I don't think it is worth it- at least based on what I had.

Anyway moving on I believe I reserved the table through Yelp but we still had an hours wait when we arrived, that's OK because we ordered Irish creams (spiked coffee) to keep us warm well waiting outside, plus we huddled. Once we were seated (a bit tight for six people) they took our drink  orders immediately.  after a bit of a wait --which is not a problem when the spiked coffee keeps me grounded (pun intended)--the food started to flow out.  Everyone's meals look incredibly delicious.  I ordered the Cat fish and Grits with a side of grilled shrimp, didn't realize it came with a biscuit so I ordered  rye toast so I just used that to sop up the rest of the grits. Everything was excellent, I sampled my daughters smoked salmon eggs Benedict w/hollandaise sauce.  The service was great considering how busy they were. I made the mistake of going to the restroom once my meal was almost complete and upon returning to my table my chair was missing, everyone around us were just as perplexed as I was.  My group were either on the phone or in tents in conversation to not have seen it taken. I stayed for quite some time which is why they are not getting five stars, one of the server said she saw being taken but did not offer any explanation as to why she allowed it.

I ended up choosing the Chicken St. Charles- fried chicken served on buttermilk biscuits, topped with two poached eggs and a pork tasso cream sauce. This dish was so incredibly tasty. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The buttermilk biscuits were flaky and buttery with a slight crunch. The sauce tied the dish together- it was creamy and super savory. I'd highly recommend this dish. In addition, I had some breakfast potatoes and they were pretty good, but they were a bit under seasoned in my opinion. I also tried the french toast and I really liked it! To be honest, I feel like you can't go wrong with anything at this restaurant.

I'm a fan of dark roast, so I found the coffee wanting. I ordered a cold brew iced coffee and felt I should have just stuck with the water. \n\nThe server will want your full order since they may not allow additions later on because of the crowds. I was thinking about getting French toast, but wanted to see if I was still hungry after the other dishes. \n\nNow the reason I did not give a 4th star is that we felt that we were a bit rushed to finish up and leave.

The St. Charles chicken, and pork were great. It was a lot of food, and I couldn't eat it all. My husband got the shrimp omelette, and added a side of chicken sausage which he really liked. He said the omelette was good, but didn't blow his mind or anything. \n\nService was pretty good, our waiter was friendly and got our food correct. I felt like once they realized we weren't ordering drinks though, they lost some interest as is the case in many restaurants we went to in NOLA sadly. Overall, I'm glad we went, but also glad we didn't make a trip specifically for it. We had wanted to go to some shops on Magazine, and thought it was a perfect opportunity to go.  I would have been disappointed if we had gone just for it.", "date": "2018-04-03 04:23:40"}

As we looked over the menu we decided on trying a few different benedicts that they are known for. I ordered the Pulled Pork Benedict. My wife ordered the Bacon and chicken benedict. All came out with different hollandaise sauce. \nAt the end of the day we both agreed that the pulled pork benedict was better in taste as the pork was so moist. All the benedicts are served on a biscuit not a muffin as it normally would. We also ordered a side of Breakfast potatoes and fried green tomatoes.

We also ordered the Ruby Slipper Salad, which I'm guessing is their signature salad. It was the perfect complement to the bennys, although the salad had a bit too much vinaigrette for my liking.

I sat at the bar and watched the bartender pour more mimosas than I could count. The benedicts are some of their classic dishes. Order the Peacemaker Benny and you can try two different bennys. I tried the Eggs Cochon and the Hot Smoked Salmon. Both were delicious. The Eggs Cochon was a Benny with apple-braised pulled pork and it was amazing. Staff was very friendly.

The pancake was perfectly sweet and fluffy, not overdone on the edges, and we absolutely devoured it. I got a traditional mimosa which wasn't super stellar. It was good just nothing to rave about. I did see a few people with the house special mimosa which seemed to be popular- maybe give that one a shot instead. \n\nAtmosphere:\nCasual and bustling for sure. They had the floor to ceiling window/doors which are ever present in this city. So it had a nice charm to it. It was definitely busy for a Saturday brunch however.

Ruby Slipper Cafe had been recommended to us by several people,and it happened to be 2 doors over from our hotel- perfect! We literally rolled out of bed on a Sunday morning and walked over. We were told there was a 30 minute wait, but that we just had to check Yelp to let us know where we stood in line (so cool!). We just walked back to our hotel room, waited like 5 minutes, and just like that we were notified our table was ready! We walked back over and were seated almost immediately. \n\nI ordered a hot green tea and my husband went with coffee. We had both read reviews on how good the benedicts were, so we knew we had to go with those. I was super excited to see that you could order \"The Peacemaker\" which allows you to try two different benedicts. I selected the Chicken St. Charles and the Shrimp Boogaloo. Sam went with the Chicken St. Charles and the Eggs Cochon. \n\nThe food came out surprisingly fast! The benedicts looked amazing! I tried the shrimp boogaloo (Gulf shrimp sauteed with pork tasso and creole tomato sauce served over fried green tomatoes, a buttermilk\nbiscuit and two poached eggs) first and OH MY GOD that creole sauce. The shrimp were so good!!!! And on that biscuit! Ugh! Amazing! I then tried a bite of the Chicken St. Charles (Fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with a pork\ntasso cream sauce). This was also very tasty, but not nearly as mind blowing as the shrimp. My only complaint is that the eggs weren't runny. They were basically soft boiled. Runny egg yolk mixing with the sauce and sopped up by the bread is my favorite part of eating eggs benedict. I didn't get that with what we had at Ruby Slipper Cafe. Sam loved his Eggs Cochon (Slow-cooked, apple-braised pork debris served over a\nbuttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with hollandaise), and was happy, but not blown away by the Chicken St. Charles. \n\nOverall it was a good visit. We had very attentive servers and tasty food. I would definitely come back. I would just request that they not cook the eggs as long.", "date": "2018-06-27 15:41:08"}

My one recommendation to all my fellow Yelpers who plan to come here is to JOIN THE WAIT LIST AHEAD OF TIME IF YOU PLAN TO COME ANY TIME AFTER 9:30 A.M. There is always a wait here of at least an hour even if it's just a party of 2. However it's well worth the wait.", "date": "2018-07-29 23:46:19"}

The BBQ shrimp and grits are pretty good--I could drink the sauce by the shot and the grits are perfect, fluffy and silky at the same time (how?! how they got such good grits?! witchcraft probably), but my shrimp were a little rubbery.

My friend had the coconut mango french toast and scraped her plate clean. The Eggs Creole other September special is to die for!", "date": "2018-09-12 01:02:55"}

We wanted a good authentic New Orleans breakfast so after seeing the reviews, we decided to go here. We thought we were in for a treat but this turned into the worst breakfast I had ever had. \n\nFirst, the food took a while to come out. Then when it did, my friend got the wrong omelet. She bit into it and told the waitress it was wrong. They took FOREVER bringing out the correct omelet. Then when that came she said it was nasty. We spoke to the manager and she then recommended a third dish. My friend said this was better than the Mexican omelet but not the best. So, out of three tries, the amigo breakfast but the best - but it was still mediocre. \n\nI got the catfish and grits. The grits were plain underneath, no butter, salt or pepper or cheese. The fish was barely seasoned and the sauce on top was not enough. I had to ask for extra to try and her some flavor. When I mentioned to this manager, she said she knew the seasoning was low on the food and that was HER number one complain. MA'AM.. Smh\n\nLastly, my sister got the meal with three different biscuits and she for hers comped because it wasn't good, either.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't even recommend this place. Hopefully, they make some necessary changes in the future. I have never had a breakfast so bad before. Try anywhere else! I urge you.", "date": "2018-09-16 14:20:35"}

I think if they didn't have it, it wouldn't be worth coming here & waiting the entire time. So definitely use the yelp app to add your name on the waitlist!! If you have a party of 6 or less, you have the option to put your name on the list. However, if your party is 7 or more, you have to go see the host and put your name on the list. We came on a Sunday and put our names on the waitlist around 10 am. They said it'd be an hour and a half wait but it was an hour and 45 min wait. There were 64 parties ahead of us (gasp)!! The waitlist is live so you can check on the yelp app how many more parties are ahead of you. If you have 7+ more people in your party, you can try calling them and putting your name on the list or the host told me you can choose 6 people in your party & then in the notes, say the actual amount of people in the party. When you get to the restaurant, checkin with the host and have the host update the correct party size. I wish I knew that beforehand!! We sent our lovely brother in law to hurry there and put our names on the list. So definitely do that so you don't have to waste your time walking there & physically putting your name on the list. Also, make sure to get there a little early so you're there when your table is ready. There were 2 groups that kept getting called & no one was there so they gave the table away. Also, if you're no longer going to go there, take your name off the list! \n\nFood: we ordered SO many meals... there was 7 of us and we all got one drink & we ordered 9 entrees.. it was almost $250!! Super expensive. However, the food was AMAZING! One of us got the trifecta (3 Benedict's) and the chicken st Charles (fried chicken) Benedict was everyone's favorite Benedict. We also liked the eggs cohon Benedict and stuffed French toast. The BLT was really good. The pancake flight (mix of 3 pancakes) was alright... not that good. Our favorite meal though was the banana foster!!! SO good! Omg. Drooling just thinking about it. It was super sweet though so I suggest getting one to share with the table... it might be a little too sweet as a whole entree for one person. Vegetarian wise, you can order something without meat. I got a Benedict without meat & just added avocado. Boring but it was still good :) Make sure to order ASAP. We ordered around 12-12:30 and the Benedict special was sold out already and one of our guys in our group got the last one!!! So since you're waiting for a long time, I recommend you figure out what you want to eat & order ASAP after sitting down. The food also takes awhile to come out so it's nice to order sooner rather than later. \n\nService: I think you might be able to split bills which is nice. The waiters have tablets and they select what each person/chair wants. I hate when you go to a popular restaurant & the staff sucks... not the case here!! Everyone was so friendly!!! The waiters and waitresses work hard & are all so nice. The hostess was so friendly too! I'm sure they get bombarded with people repeatedly checking in/getting updates on the wait, etc but she was so friendly!!! It was such a delight to have such friendly staff! \n\nOverall, we really liked our meals here. I'd definitely recommend going & putting your name on the waitlist. Do not miss out on coming here!! Especially when the restaurant has a chain of them, you suspect the meals won't be as good... not the case here! Everything was amazing & super filling!!", "date": "2018-10-11 20:37:58"}

While scouting a good breakfast/brunch place we met an elderly couple who suggested this place.\nRight off the bat, we could sense that this place was in huge demand because there was a queue outside the restaurant and the hostess was taking down everyone's names and phone numbers and telling them to wait for 25-30 mins which is totally normal.\nI was given a wait time of 25 mins and I was told that I'm in the queue. I even received a message with a yelp link which allowed me to check my place in the queue. I went away and kept monitoring my place in the queue. And I was back at the restaurant  entrance 5 mins before my waiting time was up & before the app showed 0 parties ahead of me in the queue. I kept waiting patiently for my name to be called out, but that never happened even when the app showed that I'm up next. I was standing right there in front of the hostess. She never called out my name and finally I went up and told her that my waiting period was up already and I've waited an additional 10 mins and still my name hasn't been called. She took down my phone number again and told me to step in and wait there.\nThen I waited for another 10 mins inside the entrance of the restaurant, only to be seated at the bar, which was still fine. It was my friend's birthday and I wanted to at least sit at a table with her, but I let it go as both of us were super hungry.\nThen we ordered food. The guy who took our order was very enthusiastic and nice and great to talk to.\nI read the menu very carefully and ordered an omelette which clearly did not have bacon as one of its ingredients.\nI received my food and my omelette was stuffed with tiny pieces of bacon, like the most finely chopped bacon and way too many of those tiny pieces. The guy who had taken our order was very polite and so I didn't complain about the food right then. Plus I was super hungry and didn't want to wait another 20-ish mins just to get the right food. I ate it the way it was, by separating out the bacon pieces as much as I could. I have nothing against bacon, absolutely no restrictions as such but I just choose not to eat any type of red meat. Our interaction with the person who took our order, was the only pleasant part of our experience here.\nThe food was good. The place was crowded which meant that it was a very sought after brunch place. The ambience was good and easy going.\nThe restaurant seemed good overall, but I couldn't have a good experience majorly because of the mismanaged queue system and the screw up in my food order.", "date": "2018-10-15 22:09:39"}

Although we had about a 45 minute wait to sit (group of 9), the time flew by between the outside conversation with friends and the waitress they send around to those waiting outside for drink orders.  The Bloody Mary is a must.  A nice twist on the traditional Bloody Mary with a house mix and nice garnish of lime, a seasoned string bean, queen olives, and one or two giant pieces of bacon.  The service was great, and if you're lucky enough to draw Devin, he's pretty hysterical.  The menu offers a mix of what you would expect to find at any breakfast place (omelette, eggs Benedict, etc.), but also offers New Orleans/Southern-style dishes like chicken biscuits and gravy and shrimp and grits.  Highly recommend The Peacemaker, which is a pick-two option for Ruby Slipper's take on eggs Benedict.  Pictured in the review is the Eggs Blackstone (applewood smoked bacon and grilled tomato served on a buttermilk biscuit topped with 2 poached eggs and hollandaise sauce) and the Hot Smoked Salmon Bennie (hot smoked salmon served on top of a buttermilk biscuit topped with 2 poached eggs, finished with red onion, flash-fried capers and a dill hollandaise).  It was out of this world.  It is a little pricey if you're not watching how much you're ordering, especially the drinks, so keep that in mind.  Do yourself a favor and endure the wait.  It's well worth it.", "date": "2018-10-25 23:59:53"}

She was right on both fronts!!!\n\nRegarding the line,  my wife and I had learned once we got to the hostess stand which is just right in the doorway for the restaurant with a lovely, patient hostess, that you can either put your name in at the door or use the Yelp App to put your name in and track where you are in line to be seated.  We put our name in with the hostess and used the Yelp App to track where we were in line to get seated.\n\nAs we were waiting I had a chance to look inside.  Plenty of seating, but quite the busy place. A large U shaped breakfast bar in the middle, surrounded by 2 top tables on the left and a larger dining room to the right of the bar with 4 top tables and booths. There is also outdoor seating in the front and side of the restaurant. \n\nAfter looking at the menu, and seeing the great breakfast dishes all around me, I can definitely see what all the hype is all about. People were PATIENTLY waiting outside like this was \"the attraction\". And it certainly was.\n\nWhen our name was called, we thankfully got seated a the breakfast bar which I preferred.  There is a lot to see sitting there and recommend it if you can wait for that.  We were greeted by our vibrant and friendly server, Nicole C. (she never gave us her last name) when I asked.  We immediately knew she was from the midwest and had some fun with that when talking to her.\n\nCoffee Anyone?  Here, like many places in New Orleans, they have the BEST coffee.  We had to have the NOLA roasted coffee which was served in the special Ruby Slippers red Coffee Mugs.  Delicious.\n\nJust looking at the Specials for the day posted on the Specials Board,  which included Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes and Nutella & Raspberry French Toast and looking at the menu, this was going to be a tough choice.  The choices of 7 different \"Eggs Traodianary\" Eggs Benedict dishes and \"Momma can't make this\" Specialties alone had my head spinning.  At least my wife was with me so we could both order something different and share.  \n\nIt was no surprise that she ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes. There was no doubt that I was going to choose one of the Benedict dishes, but I was torn between Chicken St. Charles and the Eggs Cochin. Of course, Ruby Slippers had a dish called THE PEACEMAKER, which definitely gave me a piece of mind to be able to get combo of both dishes. The Chicken St. Charles is one of the most popular dishes here; Fried Chicken breast over a buttermilk biscuit topped with 2 poached eggs and a delicious sauce to top it off.  The chicken was a tender chicken breast, definitely fried Southern Style.  Juicy and tender and that Buttermilk Biscuit, well, let's just say, you would remember it after leaving here. The reason for the Eggs Cochin?  I love pulled pork, and to have that on top of the buttermilk biscuit served Benedict style with Hollandaise put me in Heaven. Between the 2 of these, I was in \"food mode\", for sure. \n\nMy wife's portion of Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes was HUGE, thankfully, topped with a powdered sugar and some special sauce drizzled on top. Amazing amazing, amazing.  I could smell the Pumpkin as soon as Nicole put it down in front of us. \n\nThe menu choices on the Momma Specials can also make your head spin, but as I learned from a gentleman sitting beside me, they have a dish called the Trifecta which allows you to combine 3 of he dishes.  Clever for a menu like this to offer that. Every dish is better than the next and to be able to try 2 of the Benedict dishes or 3 of the Specials is a smart option.\n\nFor every minute you wait, it is worth every bite you take here.  The atmosphere is lively with a lot of happy diners.  Nicole C. made our experience special and there is no doubt that a whole lot of love was put into the menu and food preparation.  \n\nABSOLUTELY the place to go when I come to NOLA, and will again and again. After all, there I a whole lot more to try here.", "date": "2018-10-28 14:41:31"}

Wait was about 30 minutes...no issue! Called inside at 12:16, seated at bar...waited & we waited! Finally about 10 minutes with no one even speaking to us, I asked a waiter if we were supposed to order on the iPad laying on bar, didn't know since we had never been there before! He said he would take our order. Person with me went & asked if we could have a table since there was such bad service at bar.  After this waiter I asked about ordering finished washing glasses & silverware he did take order, but I guess he was mad because we complained. Quick order, rude waiter, took another 30 minutes to get food. Then had to ask for coffee refill! Laid the ticket on bar & never asked if we wanted anything or if order was ok...I had to ask another waiter to take our payment!

The portions were large. The biscuits fell a little of shy of being flaky goodness, the cinnamon pancakes were average and nothing unique that you would remember after you left the establishment, and the baton sticks were on the greasier side. \nGiven the popularity of the restaurant, as seen by the number of customers patronizing the establishment, and the fact that there are three locations within a short area, my opinion definitely seems to be of the minority of customers rather than a majority of customers...so proceed forth with caution and decide for yourself if you are in the majority or in the minority.", "date": "2018-10-29 08:46:56"}

Firstly the egg chacon is delicious. My boyfriend and I visited from California and went to Ruby's twice during our stay. The first visit was to the Ruby's on Decatur Street. We waited about 10-15 minutes. Not too bad. We were greeted by our waitress, I wish I could remember her name, but she was great! Very warm and welcoming. I got the eggs chacon, I believe that's how it's spelled and my boyfriend got the Benedict with fried chicken. The fried chicken was bland and boring to us. We weren't too thrilled so my boyfriend decided to not eat it and ordered what I ordered since we were both drooling over it. We left and promised we'd return again before we left. We decided to visit this Ruby's and were extremely disappointed with the quality of service we had received. We arrived at about 10am on a freezing 45 degree morning and the wait this time was nearly an hour. I had reserved us a table for a party of four on the app. Our two friends hadn't arrived by the time our table was called and they began to inform us that they could not seat us since our full party was not there yet. I've never ran across a policy so strict. It really made me feel like Ruby's was only after the dollar sign. They want to push in and out as many customers as possible instead of seating those that have already made reservations and sat out in the cold for an hour. We decided to just seat the 2 of us hoping that they would still serve them anyways when they arrived. Once they arrived they denied them entry to us and our waiter said even if they come in he will not serve them. I was hoping for the southern hospitality when visiting Nola for the first time. And while the first experience was great the second one left a bad taste in our mouths. Needless to say we up and left and promised not to return again to give them our money. We're from California where hospitality is little to none but we have not once encountered such a ridiculous policy towards a paying customer.", "date": "2018-11-11 05:39:35"}

Then the omelette shows up and doesn't have the right ingredients. Dude goes and asks for another omelette vs. asking us how to proceed. When two people get food eating separately is annoying. Then the bill comes and they don't comp the food or anything. I think you missed the mark on customer service and if you are going to have build your own omelettes you either get the order correct or remedy the mistake to the customers liking. I don't think comping an omelette that is incorrect isn't unreasonable. I would have left a five star rating as mistakes happen and I am all about giving the restaurant an opportunity to handle. \nOmelette - goat cheese mushroom spinach roasted red pepper \nOmelette received - no cheese, no spinach, sausage, tomato mushroom. \nThis review is for the restaurant.

We were seated within 10 minutes at 8am on a Friday.  I also put on name on the waitlist through yelp as we were walking over.  Once we were seated, we ordered some coffee.  I got the NOLA iced coffee and my boyfriend got the vanilla iced coffee.  They both lacked much flavor and we ended up only drinking about half.  Our waiter was great and quick.  I can't remember his name.  We ordered the stuffed French toast with a side of bacon and eggs with cheddar cheese and the peacemaker with the chicken benedict and corned beef benedict. \nWhen our food came, that's when it really went downhill.  My boyfriend's French toast filling tasted sour and looked old.  They also put the strawberries in a bowl on the side instead of on or in the French toast.  the worst part was the side of scrambled eggs.  They brought out a small plate with scrambled eggs and they must've put the shredded cheese on 2 seconds prior to us receiving it.  The cheese was not melted and cold on top of the eggs.  It was gross and we didn't touch it.  The peacemaker wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to the hype.  Needed some more seasoning and better sauce.  Overall, we definitely wouldn't recommend.  We paid our $50 bill and took a lyft over to District Donuts for an amazing fresh breakfast for $20.  I highly recommend that place over Ruby Slipper Caf\u00e9.", "date": "2018-11-12 20:44:41"}

But the few times I have, have been like a dream. The waitlist should come as no surprise and no wait is too long for a taste of Ruby Slipper's incredible Bananas Foster French Toast--a creation of buttery rum sauce poured over a bouquet of crusty baguette and rum-flamb\u00e9ed banana slices--dotted with plump rum-soaked raisins and covered with a light, snowy dusting of powdered sugar. To add to the magic, Ruby places a crisp slice of applewood-smoked bacon atop of this sugar-butter mountain. \n\nI knew we would need a little more savory to help balance all the sweet, but nothing, not even the melt-in-your-mouth biscuits served with a side of maple butter and the pig candy--a slightly sugared piece of bacon--and the crispy breakfast potatoes that just burst with flavor as you bite down on them, none of these could come close to touching the greatness of that French toast. I am definitely a savory breakfast person. The last flavor in my mouth has to have some salt, but no matter how many times I tried to end on a salty note, I kept going back for another forkful of that Bananas Foster. \n\nSince last weekend, I've woken up every day craving that flavor that I can't seem to find anywhere else. Oh, other places have variations on that theme and they're all good, but they aren't haunting. When a restaurant is able to create a feeling of being \"haunted,\" that's when it manages to make followers out of people and I am now a follower for life.

I opted for a more flavorful fare and ordered the Peacemaker, which gives you the flexibility to mix and match any 2 of their Signature Benedicts.

They are generous with the bacon, and the pickled green beans are sublime. I still dream of that drink. All bloody Mary's dull in comparison. AFTER you've had a bloody Mary, continue your day drinking with the peach bellini mimosa, morning margarita, and the boozy iced coffee.\n\nBRUNCH IS LOVE -- I'm an eggs benedict fan, and kudos to the kitchen staff for nailing their poached eggs every time. I HIGHLY recommend: \n\n1) the Chicken St. Charles -- delicious, crispy fried chicken, topped with a perfect poached egg and a pork cream sauce of goodness. \n\n2) the Eggs Cochon -- they call it apple-braised \"pork debris,\" which didn't' sound appetizing to me, but I guess it's just a ton of small but delicious pork pieces mounded on a buttermilk biscuit, topped with a poached egg and traditional hollandaise.\n\n3) The Peacemaker for the indecisive -- if you can't choose between the two recommendations above, get one of each! They have plenty other bennies to choose from, so mix and match to your heart's content.\n\nIf you're too hung over to go with a creamy sauce, get some pancakes to soak up all the alcohol in your system -- the Pancake Flight will give you a sampling of all the delicious flapjacks they make, but if you have a sweet tooth, I recommend the Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes. Add the pure maple syrup for $1.50 more and thank me later. \n\nI also found the Southern Breakfast to be a good hang-over meal.

They're renowned for their benedicts and dessert breakfast more than anything. While our food was very good, I wish we had ordered some staple items.

It took 15 minutes to get our drinks (she forgot our order) and over 45 minutes after ordering (an hour after being sat) for us to get our meal and the server didn't seem bothered about it when we asked what was taking so long or why other's received their food first. She commented that it depended on what station we ordered from, but the party of 7 had eggs Benedict selections as well, so we weren't sure what she meant by that. After the long wait, One of our orders was wrong, and it took about 3 minutes for her to replace it with the correct order which made us wonder what the hold up was in the first place. The food wasn't that impressive. My biscuit was hard as a rock and tasted old, and the chicken on my Benedict wasn't as good as other places. A friend's plantain's tasted like cardboard and the specialty Bloody Mary wasn't worth $10.

Onto the food-\n\nSouthern breakfast - AMAZING!!! We went with this one since it seemed like a safe choice and we were mindblown. The highlight of this meal was the biscuit. It's enormous and fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside. The cinnamon butter that pairs with it is incredible. This was also my first time trying grits and they were so good! \n\nBananas foster french toast - there's a reason why this is one of those popular items here...because it's just that great. Hands down the best french toast I've ever had! I was afraid it'd be overly sweet but it wasn't at all. Even though my body was stuffed, it was so easy to keep going and going....we even got this again the 2nd time we went because I couldn't stop thinking about it. \n\nChicken St. Charles - fried chicken benedict on a biscuit. Another popular item and definitely a must-order. Not a huge fan of fried chicken or overly greasy foods but this is the one exception I'll make. The chicken is tender and seasoned well, and the batter is crisped to perfection.

Prolific as the New Orleans restaurants are, unless it's a famous place, the good \"local\" places can be hard to find without an assist. Yelp displayed Ruby Slipper as a close breakfast place near the hotel, which actually wasn't too exciting since I already know Ruby Slipper to be somewhat of a chain. Using Waitlist, we got in line online and took our time getting there. There was still a little wait - the customers were crowding the sidewalk and street, even across the street... like waiting to see a band - but not too bad, and well worth it. The wait staff are super friendly. No matter the crowd, they're not freaked out or rushed. Cool cucumbers be they. The food was served quickly, but again, not rushed. The place was filled up at 10am. While waiting outside, they take drink orders to help tame the otherwise ravenous savagery of hungover partiers. Bloody Marys with bacon were everywhere. Were I not with my son, I might have partaken. The coffee was great, but even bad coffee in New Orleans is better than anywhere you're drinking it. My son had two pancakes (yum - I tried them and recommend them) that hung lazily over his plate accompanied with scrambled eggs (good) and smoked bacon (me making Homer Simpson noises) and a hot chocolate. I had the southern breakfast. Good scrambled eggs, creamy and delicious grits, a biscuit that weighed a pound and a memorable slice of fried green tomato. The biscuit kept me fed all day. The food was great. The wait staff very friendly and accommodating. And the eclectic, bohemian ambience made the experience truly New Orleans. Can't wait to go back.", "date": "2019-04-07 20:29:43"}

Wow.  It's a busy SOB, and it feels special, definitely like your in the place to be.  Counter seating may be quicker, but we waited for a table.\n\nAlong with the daily special \"Nashville Catfish\", the menu has some cool things: Banana Pudding Stuffed French toast, 'Goo Goo' Cluster Pancake, BBQ Shrimp & Grits, Eggs Cochon, Shrimp Boogaloo Benedict, Corned Beef Bennie, Bananas Foster Pain Perdu French Toast, Bacon Praline Pancakes, and a slew of burgers, sandwiches, and omelets.\n\nI went with Croque Madame [$12.00, 4.0 stars].  Described on the menu as \"Coffee-glazed ham & swiss served on brioche bread, topped with Mornay sauce & a fried egg\".  The ham was a-m-a-z-i-n-g, but the bread was way too thick, extreme excess.  I ate a few bites, then picked out the ham & cheese, and ate the egg.  Served with french fries that were very much like McD's.\n\nOverall: This feels like the south, and it's great for that.

All in all I got called at about 1215 when there was a table available outside but I opt to wait for a table inside which took another 20 minutes so we got seated at about 12:35. \n\nI ordered the trifecta with the boozy ice coffee. I had the coffee while waiting outside for our table so I was slightly tipsy by the time I got seated. It's a good drink that was essentially an ice cafe Au Lait with a shot of alcohol. It hit the spot since I was on an empty stomach. I ate the Chicken St Charles and Shrimp Boogaloo Benedicts while at the restaurant but didn't make it to the Eggs Cochon since I was so full. The chicken was a bit hard. It definitely had a lot of batter and not enough chicken but the flavor was good. The shrimp boog was flavorful, moist and delicious. I definitely liked it better than the chicken. \n\nThe staff was very nice. Considering how busy this place gets, it's always wonderful to see that the staff can maintain their composure and great attitude.", "date": "2019-05-10 23:27:30"}

The fried chicken was also a little overdone and dry. With the addition of the biscuit, everything felt one note. \n\nShrimp boogaloo - the egg was perfectly runny on this one. The shrimp was a little over done for this one as well. I was not a fan of the fried green tomato because the batter got soggy with the sauce. I feel like if they grilled the tomato, it would be a lot better. You can get a little bit of the char from grilling it to add a smoky flavor to it. \n\nThe biscuits was probably one of the thing I liked most about both Benedicts. It was soft and buttery.

It arrived on a massive split buttermilk biscuit with hot, crispy chicken and a perfectly runny egg. He loved his meal and cleaned his plate. I ordered the peacemaker, which is a mix-and-match of two different bennies. One half of my biscuit was the shrimp boogaloo, which was perfect! There were shrimp, fried green tomatoes, sausage, and a sauce heaped onto the biscuit, and I couldn't inhale it fast enough. The other half was the smoked salmon Bennie, which I did not enjoy. The flaked salmon was dry, I didn't get enough capers to cut through all the fattiness, and it wasn't seasoned well. If I had to do it again, I would definitely get a full order of the shrimp boogaloo and leave ten pounds heavier and happier!\n\nWe ended our meal with bacon infused Bloody Marys. According to our bartender, the vodka is infused in-house with bacon, and the drink itself is tangy and spicy and just right.

I give the service and the corned beef hash a perfect score but my main meal was really subpar", "date": "2019-05-19 16:59:38"}

You can check in online and cut your wait time down significantly. Their menu has something for everyone, and the plating was great. The biscuits = excellent.\n\nOrder your mimosa with juice/puree on the side to get a healthy pour, otherwise its 50/50.\n\nThe cons: \nIt took 30+ minutes to get our food, which was a catfish benedict, a smoked salmon benedict, and a side of fried green tomatoes. The salmon had the same texture as canned cat food. If we weren't as hungry as we were, or knew we could get a replacement quicker, we would have sent it back. My gf is Jewish and eats lox/nova once or twice a month, and I grill/blacken/pan-sear fresh salmon at least 3x a month. Sadly, we both agreed it was unanimously the most disgusting salmon we've ever eaten.\n\nThere was a definite shortage of holl sauce. A biscuit as tasty and as large as a cinnabon needs some lubrication going down. We would have liked more sauce. \n\nOur side of fried green tomatoes were served with cold sour cream. I would suggest a cajun queso served hot, or a warm roumelade. Definitely ditch the sour cream.\n\nFor $15 & $17, neither one of our bennies included a side of ten cent grits, hash browns, home fries, or fresh fruit, which were extra. In visiting a dozen states in the past 4 years, I don't think I recall seeing bennies not include at least half of an orange wheel on the plate to balance the savory.", "date": "2019-05-20 19:53:16"}

This place is very popular so make sure you join the wait list before strolling through the streets to this establishment, which we did. Hubby ordered The Trifecta- 3 different style Eggs Benedict. One serving each of the Egg Conchon (apple braised pulled pork), Chicken St. Charles (fried chicken) and Shrimp Boogaloo (creole style tomato sauce) Benedict. They were served on freshly baked Buttermilk Biscuits. The eggs were perfectly poached and Aaron loved the entire dish. I ordered the Hot Smoked Salmon Omelette with Goats cheese, topped with dill, hollandaise, red onion and flash fried capers. My meal was absolutely delicious and I will say the small piece of Buttermilk biscuit that I tried was the best I've ever had. It was soft and not dense at all, in saying that I'm not a huge biscuit fan. You can order potatoes or fruit as your side with this dish too. Bloody Mary's and Mimosas are very popular over here when enjoying a Brunch. I order the Ruby Slipper Big Easy Mimosa which has OJ and a dash of Pomegranate added to the champagne. I must say this is the best mimosa I've had yet since moving to the States. They were not wrong when they said easy pour mimosa either! We sat at the bar so I watched them being made. A large wine glass 3/4 full with champagne then topped with juice for $10. Hubby had the Vodka based Bacon infused Bloody Mary which also was amazing! Overall the staff were fabulous, friendly and very accommodating on a usual busy long weekend Brunch morning. The menu has lots of choices and the meals were a fantastic price. A great birthday brunch was had and my husbands iced coffee on a very warm NOLA day to go was also very good to top it off!", "date": "2019-05-29 21:08:39"}

The chicken was done exactly how chicken in the south should be done - fried to perfection - crispy on the outside, moist (bad word I know, but apropos) and delicious on the inside.  Add an egg, sauce and put it on a monster biscuit and you've found the star of your show. \n\nThese are only a few of the dishes on their extensive menu and I have no doubt that the next time I visit New Orleans it'll be a Ruby Slipper everyday kind of trip. \n\n5 stars - great service, awesome atmosphere, amazing food.

Most of hte table I sat at ordered the peacemaker (you pick two) or the Trifecta (get all three). We had some debate about the best options but hands down it was the Fried Chicken (chicken st.

Arrived at 8:40 am ish with just a short wait.  Close to rounding to 4 stars but didn't make it as you will read. \n\nFood: 3 stars- Ordered Southern Breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon extra crisp, biscuit, fried green tomato, and cheese grits) with coffee.  Regular grits came out and cheese placed on eggs (NP for me).  Huge biscuit was so dense it was still a doughy in center.  Fried green tomatoes and extra crispy bacon spot on.  Coffee was fine.  Overall, standard meal.\n\nService:  4 stars- Greeted warmly at door.  Prior to seating, hostess cleaned top before seating.  Seated within 2 minutes.  Servers/bartenders got our drink menu within 1 minute and had our food ordered in another 3 minutes.  So pretty expedient process.  Coffee refilled PDQ.  Both servers were more on the matter of fact side rather than friendly and welcoming.  Great service just need a bit more \"personalization\" while serving and would have been a 5 Star easily (which would have given the establishment overall 4 star for sure). \n\nEnvironment: 3 stars-  average restaurant with Open seating area with some outdoor seating.  Sat at bar.  Restaurant is very noisy since it has no or to limited sound absorbing material so everything reverberated; therefore, was hard to communicate to server.", "date": "2019-06-08 15:35:41"}

It was nice to have it so close by our hotel. The waitlist option on Yelp was nice to have but it did not make a huge difference when it came to our wait time since after we checked in, we still had to wait for another 20 mins or so. \n\nAfter reading some reviews and reccomendations I had an idea of what I would order. The pictures were also helpful. Once seated, the waiter informed us that they are known for their Benedicts. Although I am not a runny egg, Benedict person I really liked the way the St. Charles option looked. I asked if I could have my eggs over hard and a non pork hollandaise sauce. Once I was was told it was doable, I was all set with my order.\n\nMy fried chicken was well flavored, my egg was not runny, my bisquit was nice and flaky and non doughy plus my side of corned beef hash was a nice compliment.  I will say, they skimped on the corned beef hash because it was more of a garnish on the baked potatoes that it came with rather than a true side on its own.\n\nMy sister had the Combo Pancake option: 1 Cinnamon Swirl  and 1 White Chocolate Bread Pudding,  they were really rich and delicious. I know this may not resonate with a lot of people but as a child I enjoyed going to McDonalds for breakfast on the weekends.  I can still remember the taste of those well balanced, buttery, and fluffy buttermilk pancakes. Strange enough, these Ruby Slipper pancakes brought back those childhood memories and I loved it.\n\nI won't say the hype is not warranted but I will acknowledge that this was a solid place for breakfast/brunch and would definitely return.", "date": "2019-06-24 23:58:10"}

After spending almost $200 on our family meal that day needless to say I was a little bit upset, but I kept it moving.  We were not going to hold up the table but just wanted to place the order.    Freddie on the other hand, we got him day 2.  He was GREAT! Very accommodating and took my togo order right from the table. My adult special needs child struggles with large group settings so we needed to take her food back to the resort.  Freddie apologize about the prior day and took care of my family.

In a huff she told us that we were in the staging area and we needed to stand there until the table was cleaned...Soooo another 10 minutes we go to our table . We sat for another 8-10 minutes before our waiter came to take our drink order.  He dropped off the drinks took the food order and vanished..............We sat for 30+ minutes...our waiter then stopped by to tell us that \" every time I pass you I feel like you want your food\"  ... \"Your food will be ready in about 19 minutes which is pretty gold for us when we are this crowded\"  another. 20 minutes and the waiter brought the food by now My husband was not happy with this and it showed on his face \" the waiter then said\" what's your problem?\" .... \"I feel like you have been mad since you got here!\" So that was the end for my husband he asked to see a manager , spoke briefly with her and we left it was too much the chaos, the loudness, the poor service, we couldn't take any more.

I did not make a reservation through Yelp (but I should have) because I did. It expect to to be super busy on a Thursday mid morning. It took about 20 minutes to be seated (not a problem for me but I encourage you to reserve through Yelp). It took the food a while (about 30 minutes) to arrive but it was good once it hit the table. It could have been a bit hotter (everything was about like warm). The coffee was a little weaker than I would have liked, but I added less cream on the second cup which helped me taste the flavor of the coffee a but more.

The servings were humongous. I don't know if anyone should eat that many pancakes in one sitting.\n\nThe shrimp and grits and the cat fish and grits were really good. My favorite was the fish and grits. They are both served with a humongous biscuit with some type of sweet honey butter which was fabulous.\n\n\nI also tried the peach Balenie. It was not good to me. Neither was the Mamosa. I think the type of wine ruined it. The sweet tea and lemonade was really thin almost taste like water with a tiny bit of tea.  I would stick to the sodas.\n\nIt took us 45 minutes to get seated the first time we visited. One of the waiters alerted us to the fact that there was a way to add your name to the list through yelp.

The crispy chicken filet (served with shoestring fries) was definitely crispy, but it was a bit underseasoned. I thought I wouldn't like the citrus coleslaw but that and the mayo definitely helped to add flavor to it. The seasonal stuffed French toast was bomb! It was too large slices of French toast bread with the filling in the middle like a sandwich. Also, this came with bacon which was cooked perfectly.\n\nThe worst thing about this place was the speediness of the service. Because we waited so long, everyone knew what they wanted to eat. It took just about another hour for us to get our food. Talk about HANGRY. Also, we didn't really get to enjoy our food because it was so rushed.

My boy FREDDIE C is the only server you should ask for. He was by far one of the nicest and most helpful fella I met in the big easy. Let me tell you about the banana French toast. Everything in this dish was delicious and worth every penny. Look at the picture it'll speak for itself. Enjoy a coffee or enjoy a beer. but I will tell you this: \"you can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning!\" Goooooo nowwwww", "date": "2019-08-18 16:35:23"}

My husband and I were visiting this place from out of state and to was my job to find a breakfast place. There were so many reviews when I looked it up that I couldn't not pass this place up! Everything was absolutely good from the service to the the drinks to the food. I was pregnant on the trip so I didn't get to partake in an alcoholic beverages, but my husband did. He got the bacon infused Bloody Mary ( house favorite drink) and be loved it! He said it was really good, especially the smokiness of the bacon in the drink. From the looks of it, seemed like either the classic Bloody Mary or the bacon infused Bloody Mary were the most popular drinks as everyone in the place pretty much had one or more on their table. The food was very good ! So fresh and hot. The pancakes had a nice little crisp to it, but yet we're still fluffy and filling. My husband said the Benedicts had so much flavor to it and that all the flavors were matched perfectly. There was not one flavor that overpowered the other. Definitely recommend if you are in town and I was also recommend checking in via the waitlist app on yelp as the wait to sit here can easily increase. We used the waitlist app and were placed no longer than 5 minutes after being there which a lot of people didnt like who were there before us butttt technically we checked in before them .", "date": "2019-08-18 23:57:23"}

When I gave the host my name he asked for my # and if we preferred indoor or out, I stated whichever gets me seated quickest.

Mind you i never got a text, I only knew this because I went the extra mile to download the app. I got to check-in and the host told me they already called my name and cancelled my reservation. Excuse Me! So, I showed him my app and how it still said I was #8 and to check in now. He then said oh I'll put you back at the top of the list and you'll be seated next. 4 tables of 2 say down, a table of, and a table of 6. So, was I really put at the top of the list?!

Is outside alright?\" At this point I didnt care anymore sure. We sat. We got a waitress who said it was her first day..she guided me wrong when I was ordering I did not get what she told me. It was still good, but not what I thought I was getting. She didnt check up on us. We got 1 refill of our drinks after chasing her down.

She explained all of the local foods and what was all in it. She gave amazing recommendations that were spot on. She had set such a high standard for your restaurant that I was excited to see your other location on canal street. Let's just say that they did NOT live up to Julie's standard or the quality of food at your location.  So the next day we decided it was worth the 15 min walk (I have two bad knees and my husband has two bad hips) just to see Julie and have that expert level of customer service and human kindness again. She embodies what my Memaw and my Mamaw said was southern hospitality . Even though we did not get her as are AMAZING waitress today,  she remembered us. She took time out of her busy day to come say hi and make us feel just as welcomed as she did when we were in her section.  I am simply shocked and baffled by the fact that she is not the regional trainer for waitresses.  If you staff showed 10% of the service skills that she has, you would be a national chain!

I enjoyed eggs cochon, which was pork debris, almost like a braised pulled pork over a buttermilk biscuit and topped with poached eggs and hollandaise. The Chicken St. Charles was an exquisite fried chicken topped with a decadent cream sauce. Even though I am not a big fan of fried chicken, it was crispy and still moist. The shrimp boogaloo was also good with big gulf shrimp over a fried green tomato and creole tomato sauce. My only complaints were the bottom of the buttermilk biscuits were very hard and my poached eggs were a tad bit overcooked that the yolks were hard, not runny. \n\nCORNED BEEF: A underrated dish at Ruby Slippers - corned beef hash served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, horseradish cream, finished with hollandaise. My SO favorite diner dish is corned beef hash and this did not disappoint. His eggs were perfectly cooked and biscuits were flaky and soft.

Most of the group did the mix and match with the egg Benedicts. They were hit or miss depending on which Benedict you chose. \n\nFood takes a while to come out, probably because they're so busy. Service is lackluster and sometimes rude. We heard our waitress yelling at a couple behind us because they wanted to switch tables since their fan wasn't working.\n\nOur seats were uncomfortable, food was ehhhh, and everything just underwhelming considering all the good things we heard.

It pains me writing this because I wanted to love this place so badly! I had been planning on stopping here on our trip to New Orleans because my friends had been raving about it. We checked into the waitlist on yelp but still had to wait for awhile when we got to restaurant, which is okay. This place is very popular so if you are going at a high traffic time you should plan on a bit of a wait. One thing I really liked is that you could purchase a drink or alcoholic beverage to enjoy while you were waiting. When we finally got seated at the bar we ordered drinks and food. We got our drinks and waited for our food. And we waited, and waited, and waited. After almost 30 minutes the bar tender noticed our food still hadn't come out and went to check on it. Which is not the bar tenders fault whatsoever, but of course we're hungry so we're getting a bit impatient. Finally when our food came out, the shrimp in my fianc\u00e9e's shrimp and grits were definitely undercooked. But at that point we'd be there so long we were just over it so he ate what he could instead of sending it back and ate part of my meal that definitely was more noteworthy than his food. While I really was looking forward to eating here, I honestly felt like it left me really disappointed and wasn't worth the wait whatsoever.", "date": "2019-10-22 23:44:11"}

Not nearly as heavy as you would expect... The business very light and there was just the right amount of rich, salty pork. The hollandaise almost tasted like cheddar, but it was really good.

The vanilla iced coffee was pretty weak and the spicy vanilla coffee was covered in canned whipped cream, but their regular old coffee is pretty good and definitely better than the fancier ones IMHO. \n\nAnd my second trip back I had the bananas Foster French toast, and I was not impressed... I think my expectations were too high because of what I had read online, but the bread was tough, there weren't very much bananas, and it was REALLY sweet (more sweet than flavorful).

So I ordered the tomato/tomato eggs benadict. \"Note\"; They did give me a complimentary cup of luke warm tea after a 1/2 hour into my wait. I Had to ask the server three times where my meal was. Each time he checked on it. Nice guy, he wasn't the cook. By the 3rd time and an hr later my blood was boiling. I dropped a few singles on their counter and hit  the door. Hostess did ask me why I was so angry? My Response was; you figure it out I've been sitting in here for an hr waiting for sum eggs. Be cautious and speak up or you'll just sit there with a cup of cold tea! Employees have to quit BULLSHITTING and do your jobs.

We came here on our last day in the city. Immediately, the outer appearance of the Broad St. location was odd... it looks like a government office building from that side... but that's the way our directions gave us. If you come in from the other side of the corner, that's the way in. Cute little cafe with bright colors and chalk-written signs with fun sayings about food, drinks, and brunch. A hipster's dream, but we found out they have the goods to back it up. \nWe ordered 2 bloody mary's and an Irish coffee... my Irish coffee was good, but the 2 bloody mary's looked totally different- one was very strong and almost clear, while the second was much thicker and darker with much more mix. Wish I took a side-by-side photo because it was so obviously inconsistent to serve to the same table at the same time. That being said, this was the one and only mishap of the entire meal. \n\nWe ordered the special crawfish benedict and the Eggs Cochon benedict. Both were amazing! The crawfish version was served on a grits cake and the cochon was piled high on a buttermilk biscuit. They could've used HALF the pork on the cochon- at the end, I had enough meat on my plate still to make an entire second order and I had eaten A LOT of pork already. The biscuit was buttery and the sauce was delicious and tangy. My friends raved about the Crawfish Benedict being the best thing they ate the entire trip... and we tried many different places over the week!\n\nThey also have a bunch of really cute logo swag, all made with quality fabric that makes you want to wear it. We bought a couple of shirts to commemorate our awesome meal, even though they were kinda pricey ($26 for a t-shirt and $40 for a long sleeve with a hood).\n\nOverall, this is a DON'T MISS when you're visiting NOLA and we will definitely be going back next time we're in town!", "date": "2021-02-21 22:51:43"}

It was surprisingly refreshing but dangerously good you do not taste the alcohol at all! The food was very good and full of flavor. I took advantage of the seafood and got the Gulf Shrimp Omelet.

The indoor seating is definitely more spaced out than in previous pictures, but it still feels a little cramped, so we decided to eat outside. The reason for my four stars was mostly because of the service. I've worked in similar brunch spots like this and what really makes the experience, in addition to food and ambiance, is service. Maybe our waiter was having a bad day, but you gotta put that past you when you serve a table and he didn't do that, so that's disappointing. Everything came out great, but just his attitude and lax demeanor made it a little less enjoyable. \n\nRegardless, food was overall good. The beignets were a little disappointingly small, but still good. My friend enjoyed the burger, but said it was a little dry (he doesn't eat pork, so he didn't get the bacon though, which we were told makes the dish, so make sure to have bacon in yours when you order this). The sliders were amazing and to be honest, I don't remember their names because I got four different ones. The best ones though were the chicken and gravy biscuit sandwich and the eggs Benedict with corned beef.

That was awesome.  I recommend them. Fried small bite sized  crispy square dough. It had jam and sweet cream cheese. I liked it.\n   My breakfast the corned beef egg Benedict. It came in a bed of spinach and potatoes on the side. It was great.  The eggs perfectly cooked. The corned beef was delicious also. The hollandaise sauce was very tasty. It was one of the best.

The drinks were my favorite part. \n\nIf your in need of a meal and this place doesn't have a line I'd go but it for sure isn't worth waiting in line.", "date": "2021-05-23 13:40:00"}

The best part of the meal was when the table next to us, seated well after us, ordered the special that was \"out\" . It sure looked good while they were eating it.

After about 20 minutes he finally took my order - I had the Bacon Bites appetizer, migas, and the bacon infused Bloody Mary.  The Bacon and the Bloody were top shelf - totally worth the wait and BS involved.  However, the migas were meh. Migas is my second favorite breakfast food next to only biscuits and gravy - I've had migas all over Texas so I feel like I have a pretty good frame of reference for what makes the dish well prepared.  Here the eggs were generally fine - maybe a little cool when they arrived - but the real disappointment was the tortilla strips which seemed to be either stale or soggy. Anyone who like migas knows that the tortilla really makes the dish otherwise it's just a chorizo and eggs scramble. Any way these migas were maybe a 5/10.  The bacon really saved this visit for me.

The food and service were good! \n\nI went with three other people so we ordered different dishes. We ordered two different omelettes, Chicken & French Toast Bites, and Biscuits & Gravy. Everything was good as it usually is. I had the Biscuits & Gravy. You could tell the biscuits were homemade. They had a good flavor as well as they were thick. I could have used a little more gravy but I made it work. My mom had the Chicken & French Toast Bites. She let me try them. The French Toast Bites tasted like a hybrid of French Toast and cornbread. It was an interesting taste. The chicken was ok. It tasted good where the spicy sauce was but where it wasn't, the chicken was a little bland.

There is not a ton of seating, so they can't really accommodate a lot of people, which definitely added to the chaos. Do not just show up, or you will be one of those people waiting for 2 hours.

From the Hostess all the way up to the Manager the Customer Service is as excellent!\nDay2- We bragged about it so much my Mom insisted on coming back on our final day. And once again they did not disappoint. And getting in went just as smooth as the first time.", "date": "2021-07-01 19:49:02"}

The hour wait didn't bother me. The hostess told me how long it would be, I chose to put my name in, I expected to wait. We got our text that our table was ready, we walked up to the hostess stand and we were promptly seated at the bar. I LOVE sitting at the bar. I love the energy of a bar, the activity and he people watching. We had just seen in a local magazine that the Ruby Slipper was voted best breakfast in New Orleans so super excited. I understand restaurants are understaffed, I understand where there are challenges, I am experiencing them in my business. As a restaurant owner, I tend to actually be much more tolerant and give the benefit of the doubt. We get out coffee, there are two bartenders working, a man and a woman. Coffee is hot, bar is great, we place our order. We ordered the trifecta (love the ability to try a variety), sausage, bacon, grits, home fries and a build your own omelet. Awesome, excited! See a couple across from us who order at the same time and a man across from us who orders shortly after. Order on our receipt went in at 10:38. Ok, cool, coffee, conversation, great energy in the restaurant. Fast forward 15/20 minutes, couple across from us who ordered at the same time get their food. Awesome, ours should be soon. Guy across from us gets his food. Um, he ordered after us, ok, ours should be coming. At 11:05 I ask how much longer. I know they are busy, I also know that people who ordered at the same time as us and after have gotten their food. Guy across from us ordered the same thing I got so it's not like it was a longer ticket time item. The bartender comes back and says we are the second order on the screen. I ask when the guy across from me ordered, turns out three minutes after me. The couple who ordered when I ordered is finishing up and getting their bill. Now I'm irked. Another 8 minutes. Now, this is where I'm really not happy with the service. Not once did the servers acknowledge that it was taking a while, nothing like \"hey, I'm sorry, that's super frustrating that you see food coming out and it's not yours\", not \" let me go grab my manager this really is taking a long time\". The female bartender avoided us once I asked where the food was. No one went to a manager to say hey, go check on these guests. No manager was required, but the bartender didn't even acknowledge the near 40 minute wait for food. The food was served, my food had been sitting under a heat lamp, plate was hot, top of the benedicts were hot, poached eggs were not hot. The omelette was not hot inside, the potatoes had no crisp and what looked like a beautifully presented meal was disappointing. The food was \"fine\" but nothing exceptional and certainly not worth the time or money. I realize there are thousands of amazing reviews and mine isn't like the other reviews but, an empathetic acknowledgment or a table touch by a manager could have turned this around. Obviously being voted the best breakfast doesn't happen with experiences like this and my little review isn't going to make it break their business but, I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in the lack of attention to service. I know a kitchen manages a huge part of a meal but the service was less than lack luster and it didn't have to be. I'd like to give 1.5 stars but it's not an option. One star is the kind of place you walk out of. If it had been 10 more minutes I would have.", "date": "2021-07-08 03:41:02"}

The Bellini has a fresh peach pur\u00e9e that adds sweetness. The food is so good.  Everything fresh and plated to perfection. I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. Let me be clear...this was my first time having poached eggs. And I almost cried after I ordered it. Just the thought made me a little nervous to have ordered it. But honey...when I tell you that thang was GOOOOD?!? OMG. I got the corned beef hash with mine. And I couldn't believe how amazing it tasted. The egg and the sauce were just fantastic. I ordered an extra side of the corned beef hash just because it was THAT good. Tried almost all of Benedict's during my trip. And the corned beef was my favorite. The crab cakes were perfectly seasoned. I never reached for seasoning for anything. The gluten free menu is extensive, too. Everyone on the staff was friendly and supportive to each other.

Everyone was greeting us with a smile and kind !! \nI came here on a early monday morning, but I've heard this place is VERY BUSY, so if you want to eat with out a wait, GO EARLY !!

It does get packed quickly so make sure to get there early or allow yourself the time to wait.", "date": "2021-10-12 20:57:00"}

We came here based on the amazing reviews, and stopped by for brunch.  New Orleans has some of the most amazing food, and so we figured this would be a fantastic place to continue our food extravaganza!\n\nWe ordered the Green Fried Tomatoes... and let's just say, if this was the last food on earth I'd get to eat, I wouldn't complain.  They were delicious.  So was the - french truck coffee which is code for - here's how good coffee can actually taste!  We sat at the bar, and the service was great - until I got my Breakfast Tacos which were super bland... as I was dissecting my order trying to match the ingredients list (which sounded delicious) to what was actually in the taco and trying to figure out where this whole thing went off track straight into bland town... I realized it was missing the sourcream, and cheese... so what I ended up with was a rather watery, eggy, boring tasting mess...here's where Jarod comes in.  Without me saying a word, and honestly, I would have kept my mouth shut, he could tell something was off, and quickly realized with a glance that it wasn't done correctly.  Without my prompting, or talking him out of it, he took care of it immediately and got me the correct plate...\n\n...This would have been a 1 star review - 2 if I was feeling generous, because despite the coffee, and the amazing fried green tomatoes... this is a big miss.  But Jarod saved it.  Kindly, with empathy, a smile, and without any hassle... if I as running a business, and had nothing but Jarod's working for me... it would be called SPACE X and it would be taking us to mars as we speak... so here's to Jarod, I hope he gets appreciation, kind words, maybe even a hug, and a raise!", "date": "2021-11-01 21:53:21"}

Follow my Instagram for more reviews!\n\n\nThis was my first time at Ruby Slipper. I got there early to avoid the long wait due to their popularity. I sat at the bar and the service was great. The bartender checked on me to make sure I was alright with everything. I seen another person ordered the \"Creamy Vanilla Spiced Latte\" and I had to get one myself!  It was amazing! Perfect drink for the holidays. They known for their Benedict's but I wasn't in the mood for one so I ordered \"Shrimp & Grits\" with bacon on the side. The gravy or sauce for the dish had a tangy taste to it that I didn't like. I can't describe it, but I didn't expect that taste from some shrimp and grits. Every thing else was good to me. Crispy bacon and a fluffy biscuit. Overall my experience was great just couldn't adjust to their sauce in the shrimp and grits.", "date": "2021-12-27 16:25:07"}

We are glad the wait wasn't too long, and definitely order more than we should, and definitely super stuffed afterwards. You can see the descriptions of our orders below.\n\n- Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes [GET]: Three giant pancakes filled with cinnamon and sugar topped with cream cheese icing. Pancakes were soft and fluffy, with a crispy and buttery outer layer, you can definitely can taste the butter. There's two slices of applewood-smoked bacon served on the side, crispy and tender. The maple syrup was high-quality and tasted amazing. I wasn't a big fan of the cream cheese icing, a bit on the saltier side, but just personal preferences. \n\n- Sweet Heat Chicken & French Toast Bites [GET]: Fried chicken and fresh strawberries tossed in Mike's Hot Honey Glaze over French toast bites. The fried chicken was phenomenal, super juicy and tasty drenched in sauce, but it wasn't overpowering the chicken. The French toast bites were my favorite. It was airy and light, once again crispy too and dipped in that heavenly sauce. This is the MUST get dish, like chicken with waffles, but much better.  \n\n- Chicken St. Charles Benedicts [GET]: Two fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit. Fried chicken was tender and juicy. I love the biscuit, because it was moist, buttery, and crunchy on the outer layer. They definitely nailed their biscuits. The eggs was poached perfectly with a running yolk, and finished with a pork Tasso cream sauce. \n\n- The Peacemaker [GET]: Great option if you cannot decide which Benedicts to get, so you get to mix and match two of their Benedicts. We picked the Bayou Shrimp and Eggs Cochon. The Eggs Cochon was our favorite. The shrimp was fresh, eggs are well poached, and the fried green tomatoes added a great crunch to the Benedict. The pork was well-cooked in their apple-braised pork debris, and the hollandaise sauce gave it a great flavor, and added a nice texture to the biscuits. \n\nAmbiance: 4.5/5 - Ruby Slipper is located on Magazine Street, walking distance to Jackson Square and the French Quarter. This place has a very cute exterior, looks like the Flatiron building in NYC from an angle. The place is lit with a bunch of people standing in line and waiters bussing to get between us. There's a bar area to sit along with some outdoor seatings as well. Indoor is loud, because it is packed with customers. I would say you can't get any more authentic NOLA experience than having brunch here. \n\nPrice: 4.25/5 - The cinnamon swirl pancakes are $12, sweet heat chicken & French toast bites was $14.50, chicken St. Charles was $15, and lastly the peacemaker is $16. The total after taxes and tips came up to be around $73. Portions are huge, especially the pancakes. We do not know how we finished everything, but definitely left with a food coma. Worth the price I'd say.  \n\nService: 4.25/5 - I think everyone here was friendly and helpful. The lady at the front was nice, and made sure we were on the waitlist. Our server was attentive, provided some good recommendations and let us know that the kitchen is backed up with orders. The food still came out in a reasonable time, hot and fresh. Had a great experience for sure. \n\nBLUF: A popular and famous brunch spot you should visit while in NOLA. Make sure to put your name down on the waitlist on their website, and check-in with the host for a shorter wait time. I recommend the Eggs Cochon Benedicts and the Sweet Heat Chicken & French Toast Bites, best dishes at Ruby Slipper.", "date": "2021-12-28 16:55:37"}

The waiter at first spoke back when we said it was cold rather than simply apologizing (and continued to provide poor service throughout the meal). When the food did arrive after, the flavors were overpowering and it was not in a hollandaise sauce as stated. The eggs were overcooked rather than poached properly. We even had bad stomachs after the meal (and I can now see another reviewer on yelp who had the same experience). Additionally the restaurant was very cold as they left the door wide open when it was very cold outside and everyone had their coats on, so the ambience wasn't comfortable. Giving two stars is actually generous and mainly based on a different waiter being nice. We wouldn't return here or recommend to others.

A group of us went during our girls weekend and we were not disappointed! We did wait a little over an hour but they have the bar set up so you can walk up and order drinks while you wait. The food was very good and service was great too. Definitely recommend a trip here!", "date": "2022-01-17 19:58:43"}
