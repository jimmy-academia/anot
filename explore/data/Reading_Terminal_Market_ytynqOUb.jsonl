Reading Market is one of my favorites. It's right in the middle of  Center City, which makes it a very convenient place for tourists to pop into when they're checking out downtown Philly. (There's a broad range of places to eat.)  It's a good example of local color, what with the Amish vendors. And it has some unique features that give it a quirky charm all its own. I liked the old guy who played the piano for tips, for example. And the book stall. And the way market workers wheeled flats of produce right into the middle of the the crowded public areas. (A nice retro touch.) But I especially liked the beer bar set right in the middle of the market. Reading Market is prime people-watching territory, and it was a stroke of genius to put a bar in the middle of it-----the only thing better than people-watching is people-watching while imbibing a tall cold one.", "date": "2006-06-05 23:01:21"}

Facing the main seating area, it possesses many freshly roasted gobblers for one's slicing pleasure; I got a cranberry sauce, stuffing, and turkey sandwich, and though it was expensive, it was gut-busting and absolutely delicious. The homestyle sides such as macaroni and cheese and greens, however, are less exciting; stick with the sandwiches. \n\nThere is also a Middle Eastern Joint that serves a variety of specialties, particularly hummus, baba ghannoush, grapes leaves, falafel, etc. This was incredibly expensive, I thought, at $6.17, especially when all I received was hummus, baba, and an eggplant stew which seemed to consist more of peppers than of eggplant; the pita was also quite thin, and lacked the fluffiness that others possess. \n\nThe \"stew\" and the baba were good, but I could have done without the hummus, which had an odd taste that I can't even describe. I was still hungry, in fact, so I ended up purchasing one of their spinach pies for the road. Unlike spanakopita, the spinach-minus-feta is stuffed inside of a bread-like shell rather than flaky phyllo; it was good but a little plain. This particular place also sells juices; my friend purchased one and really enjoyed it, saying it filled her up. \n\nThe various green grocers have tons of fresh fruits and vegetables, while the fishmongers and butchers have endless varieties of cuts and sea creatures. I've never bought from these guys because I don't live here...and I don't think I should let raw meat sit out for the bus ride home. \n\nParticularly enticing \"stores\" are the ones that sell cookbooks, kitchenware, unusual jams/jellies, and spices; definitely give those a try. \n\nNext time I'm out there, I'll be sure to get Bassett's ice cream, and maybe try an amish kiosk or two; that stuff is so exotic to me-heh.", "date": "2008-03-03 18:23:46"}

It's not that it's a good idea to have such a wide breadth of local flavor all in one place it's the execution that's lacking.  \n\nWhat I mean is that most of the local flavor is represented but it's represented poorly meaning that most of the food is mediocre which is too bad considering you can walk a couple blocks to get the best of (insert food style).  In most cases, it's not who makes the best of a certain type of food but who can afford to pay the rent there.  What would really make the pace special is if they chose the top vendors as opposed to whoever can pay the most rent.  \n\nThe other issue, and this is a big one, is the lack of being open on Sunday.  This is really a chicken/egg issue.  Are most businesses closed on Sunday because of lack of business or is there a lack of business because most of them are closed?  All I know is this seems to be an epidemic in what is a city the size of Philadelphia.  In order to attract people into the center of city during the weekend, it has to be open first.  I understand that many of the businesses have religious reasons for not working on the Lord's day but this is akin to Chinatown shutting down one day a week in New York.

I can't say for all of the Chinese food in there, but I think if you really want some you should just go to Chinatown a few blocks away.  The Amish places are definitely God-send.  Very, very good hot apple dumplings.  Iovine produce is great because they provided me with reasonably priced healthy snacks and fruits. The fresh juice place is pretty awesome.

Then we walk around for about half an hour to see what gets our taste buds going that day. Then we eat! And eat, and eat! We always have a cooler in the trunk of the car for this trip so we can bring home some of the wonderful looking fresh meats or fish. \n\nThis is a must-do if you visit anywhere near Philly.

During my trip I had planned to get out see some of the sights (the historic buildings around Independence Hall, the Rocky Statue, and the University of Pennsylvania just to name a few).  Not wanting to have to walk to a fast food joint for lunch, the hotel conceirge recommended taking a short walk to the market down the street.  Keep in mind that this was my first trip to Philly and so I thought this place was nothing more than a corner grocery store.  Oops.\n\nIf you have never been to Philly but are looking to make the trip, you absolutely must make this part of your itinerary.  This place will absolutely blow you away.  For the record, this a huge farmers market that serves, well, everything.  Italian subs, cheesesteaks, tacos, sausages, burgers, cajun foods, chinese foods, artisan breads, ice cream and yogurt, seafood, hoagies, fresh produce, specialty cheeses and they even have a full service amish bakery.  And thats barely scratching the surface.\n\nI was only in Philly for five days so there was no way to try out all these places, but I can tell you what I did have was all good.  Carmen's Hoagies were delicious, the Little Thai Market has outstanding chicken dishes, Olympic Gyro had a tremendous Pita sandwich and Beiler's Amish Bakery had an apple dumpling dessert that was out of this world!  In all I think I only had 3 or 4 meals during my trip that didn't come from the market.  For those of you who enjoy farmers markets, this place is the creme de la creme of farmers markets.  \n\nA couple of pieces of information for you if you decide to make the trip.  First, bring cash.  Some of the vendors take debit or credit, but most that I encountered only took cash.  Second, check the Reading Market website for hours for each vendor as they all have different schedules.  Usually a late lunch is a good time to go as the crowds aren't as thick and most of the vendors are still open.  Third and lastly, this is the perfect place if you want to try out true Philly food.  There's other famous spots in town, but if you're crunched for time like I was, this place has all the Philly staples you'd expect.  Pretzels, cheesesteaks, hoagies, you name it.\n\nIf you're in Philly and looking to sample some fresh local faire, it doesn't get much better than this.  What Pikes Public Market does for downtown Seattle, this place does for downtown Philly.  A wildly popular local market where people can load up on just about anything.  I don't know when my next trip into Philly will be, but you can bet your bottom dollar on where one of my first stops will be.", "date": "2008-12-04 21:43:43"}

I got a cornbeef sandwich at one of the Deli's and it was delicious, very fresh and good quality. It's fun to just walk around and look at all the things they have there.

Go early in the day because they sell out often - they're only $1 and are the closest approximation to earthly bliss I've ever experienced. \n\nFresh produce, fish, meat, flowers, baked goods (make sure to stop by Flying Monkey Patisserie for some cupcakes to wash down your Whoopie Pie) and more...the choices are outrageous and there's something for everyone. I also love me some Delilah's for Southern food and the Amish food counter for some breakfast delights.  If you have the option of not visiting at lunchtime, I highly suggest you stay far away, as the experience just isn't the same when it's crowded; and trust me, the elbow to boob factor is crazy high during peak hours!

This place is great and I'm a big fan of marketplaces like Pike Place and Chelsea Market, so I had to go visit. It's located conveniently near the Convention Center, so if you're ever in town for an event there it makes it perfect for grabbing an affordable meal. \n\nFor a Sunday a lot of the vendors were open. It was nice to just walk around and see all the varieties of food available. It seems like they have everything  from Indian to Mexican to Kosher Deli to Crepes. Along with prepared food, there are numerous meat, cheese, produce, bread, bakeries, chocolate, etc vendors. It is a foodie's heaven as any market is.  It was pretty busy around the one entrance we came through as a produce/meat stand was right there. My companion and I setted on some fried chicken from Delilahs which I was told was beat by Bobby Flay during a Macaroni and Cheese smackdown challenge thing. Afterwards we went to Flying Monkey Bakery for brownies and walked around. There is plenty of seating, as most food stands have counter seating and there are tables and chairs located throughout the market. The only downside is that there is one bathroom and it's pretty small so you probably have to wait.  \n\nAside from food, there are several plant, gift, etc vendors. It's definitely a place you want to check out when you're visiting Philadelphia, especially when you are hungry and indecisive, because I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find something there!

Even many locals make the market a regular stop.

Hey, I'm from California, I've never seen them before!\n\nI really wish I could've brought home some of those whoopie pies, they were AMAZING. That was the stand-out item for me. But due to their delicate nature and chocolate coating, they would not have traveled well. I did buy their pecan brittle, and that was very tasty.\n\nThe ice cream at L.D. Bassett was good. Not wow, but good. Our sandwich from DiNic's was really good, but I'm glad we split it in half to make room for everything else. I also liked the chocolate peanut butter cupcake from Flying Monkey, very moist and the frosting wasn't overly sweet.\n\nThe only disappointment for me were the chocolate chip cookies from the 4th Street Cookie company. Where's the cookie? It's all chocolate. I prefer my cookies to have a nice balance between the chocolate chips and a buttery, brown-sugary dough. But there was hardly any dough, and the dough that was there had a weird fruity sweetness. Do they sweeten with fruit juice or something? I got a really weird after-taste. I guess people like them when they're warm, because the chocolate is melty. But once they cool down, they're just not worth it.", "date": "2009-04-01 23:45:36"}

Give me one decent answer as to why one of the biggest draws in the city is closed on the city's biggest holiday.  \n\nImagine that you are a tourist from somewhere.  You take the plunge and decide that you want to take the family to Philadelphia for the 4th of July celebration.  You have know all about independence hall and the liberty bell but your tourist guide also points out a large market where they have tons of great food.  You and the family walk from indy hall to the market which is no small feat considering they are from the suburbs and walking is alien and weird.  On top of that, they just got the fright of their life as it was a walk through Market East and by the gallery.  But you made it!  And you walk up and find that the market is closed.  How pissed would YOU be?\n\nIt's this kind of logic/attitude/work ethic that keeps Philly from being anything but than a could-have-been.  \n\nWhile we are on that subject, do you not realize that you are above a train station and that people might want to get meat sliced before they head home?  Why is it when I walk in after 5, your meat vendors turn me away because they don't want to get their already cleaned machines dirty nor do they want to stay a minute past 6pm?  \n\nHonestly Reading.

Every bite of anything I ate was delicious. I wish I could give you specific names of places but all I can give you is various foods and their descriptions.

Yes, I did change the lyrics. How does one justify America's oldest Farmer's Market, the Reading Terminal Market, when writing a review... You don't. \n\nYour head literally does spin around when you enter for your first time. Once you know the market well and where your favorite purveyors are, I'm sure it's a walk through the park. I had to see it all. \n\nA portion of the market does have Amish vendors, but you will only find them here Wednesdays through Saturdays, even though the rest of the market is open seven days per week. \n\nThere are over eighty vendors and covers over 1.7 acres. Two descendants of original shops are still there. This market has also been in numerous movies, including Trading Places. \n\nI walked into aromas of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and convinced myself, it was too early plus it was only vendor one, even though ten minutes later I was eating some of the best and hot pepperoni pizza I have had. \n\nThere are six bakeries, two of which I purchased baked goods from and one that I have reviewed so far. I was not thrilled with Le Bus http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-bus-bakery-philadelphia-2, but I was very happy with Termini Brothers Bakery, which I will review eventually. \n\nThey have a nice wine shop and beer garden where I noticed a few drinking beer at ten in the morning, a tea shop, coffee, dairy shops and a juice bar, where you can get blended and frozen concoctions. \n\nA homemade ice cream parlor http://www.yelp.com/biz/bassetts-ice-cream-philadelphia, cheese shops, fresh flowers, organic produce and raw milk. One place that I really loved was Salumeria, what an awesome market filled with Italian groceries, hoagies, salads and international cheese. \n\nLocal produce stands are huge and if you love variety this is your place. All locally grown and talk about a variety of mushrooms! Shops galore for cookbooks, used books, linens, pottery, crafts, handbags, a general store and Amy's Place filled with unique gifts, especially for a house warming gift or a new bride. \n\nThere are a good dozen or more meat, poultry and seafood shops and some will cook it right there for you. I did notice that on each cash counter, they do have posted whether or not they accept credit cards and if they do the minimum amount to charge. \n\nNow I'm getting hungry, amazing pulled pork and beef brisket http://www.yelp.com/biz/tommy-dinics-philadelphia#hrid:kJ9LwByjlxBcrf_cNZyJUA/src:search/query:Tommy%20DeNic's, pizza, pasta to go or eat there, sandwiches, cheesesteaks http://www.yelp.com/biz/by-george-philadelphia, perogies or crab cakes at Coastal Cave, mac & cheese or fried chicken at Delilah's http://www.yelp.com/biz/delilahs-at-the-terminal-philadelphia-2 \n\nYou can sit down in one restaurant and have a wonderful breakfast, which gets packed, there is sushi, a spice shop http://www.yelp.com/biz/spice-terminal-philadelphia, a little Thai market and chocolates galore. \n\nOriginally named the Jersey Market, since most farmers, fisherman and hunters were carrying their goods from the neighboring state to be sold here. After many complaints from the town folks of this non refrigerated outdoor market, it was dismantled and two new markets evolved from this, the Farmer's Market and the Franklin Market. \n\nThis site has been in use as a Farmer's Market since 1860 on High Street, it soon was renamed Market Street and moved indoors in 1892, because of health risks, traffic nuisances and it needed to be controlled. The Reading Railroad built the Reading Terminal Market as part of their use for downtown passengers. \n\nThe hustle and bustles, aromas and excitement fill the air and whenever I have out of town friends or family, who want to tour historic Philadelphia, I am bringing them here. \n\nThe market is closed on certain holidays and they do not keep long evening hours. Parking at several local garages can be validated inside the Terminal and will reduce your $10.00 cost to $4.00, if you are there for two hours or less. \n\nMany places offer a seven dollar meal deal and have them well posted. From what I noticed they seemed like a good deal.  I am not sure what the story of Philbert is, I do know that he is a pig that was created by Eric Berg and he is surrounded by money. Anyway, he is pretty cool and located at the end of the central cafeteria style dining area. \n\nI do hope that I did the Terminal some kind of justice, it is too awesome for words! There are out door cafe tables for two & bongos playing outside..\n\nSo, as I am walking through the market, everyone was staring at me and I do mean everyone. Finally two police officers approach me and say \"you can not wear that t-shirt in here\"! As I am looking down to see what in the world I had put on that morning, my daughter said \" Oh yes she can, six time Super Bowl champions\"! The officers laughed and said, \"yeah, I guess she can\"!  What was I thinking?!", "date": "2009-07-28 14:39:36"}

Because it was a Sunday morning, the Amish vendors were closed, but since I have yet to sample their wares, I didn't miss them.  There was plenty to choose from: produce, spices, meat, cheeses, seafood, baked goods...  Maybe it was just the novelty of the place, but I felt inspired to create.\n\nWhen we had finally filled our shopping bags with various fresh finds, we decided to get something prepared to eat.  We ended up at Kamal's Middle Eastern Specialties, where I tasted my first falafel and lamb shawerma.  Delish!  We ended at Flying Monkey Patisserie where, forced with too many choices, I ordered a brownie to eat at that moment, plus 4 different cupcakes to take home.\n\nSince there are less merchants open on Sundays, RTM was not that crowded during my visit.

Highly Recommended by me and Adam Richman (MAN V FOOD!).\n4) Bee Natural: Honey galore. Bought two bottles of Butter bean ($14.59 for 48 oz) and Blueberry honey ($4.50 for 12 oz).

My review will last 2 seconds at the top of the new reviews near you list and then get buried, never to be seen again.  Ah well, better make it count.\n\nHere's my take on it as well as a few things I learned about how to survive.\n\n1.  Come with an appetite.  I ate 3 separate lunches while I was here.  It came out to a meal every hour.  That's how I roll.\n2.  Do not come here while there is another event going on...like say a Flower Show.  It's a little disconcerting when all the parking guys are telling you to enjoy the Flower Show.\n3.  There are a bunch of pay lots to park in, just shop around for the best deal if you are going to drive in to the city.  If you're taking one of the buses from DC, you pretty much get dropped off right around the corner.\n4.  You will get up close and personal with everyone at the market.  If you dress in layers, your body will be less accessible to other people's hands.  If you get claustrophobic, do not go here.\n5.  People will think it's appropriate to bring luggage and strollers through the tiny aisles that make up the market.  Hurdle them or tip them over.  Then blame the person next to you.  This applies to old people and small children as well.  Do not be afraid to throw elbows.\n6.  If you come alone, you can sneak into all the seating areas that much easier.  There's always that lone seat that no one wants to take.  While that couple is arguing about who should take the seat, you can swoop in and solve that dilemma for them.\n7.  Bring cash.  Many of the stalls are cash only.\n8.  This is just filler.  I wanted to make the list even.", "date": "2010-03-07 01:00:17"}

Its not like being a New Yorker and going to Times Square for a meal.\n\nThe market is closed at 6PM, which is one of the few drawbacks: it has no evening hours. I hope one day that will somehow change.\n\nAlso, it can be overwhelming. Lunch rush is intense and finding a seat to enjoy that roast pork sandwich can be a challenge. I went there during lunch rush of the week between Christmas and New Year's and I have never seen it that crazy. So that's not the best time to go because hundreds of suburbanites like myself get the same idea to enjoy Reading Terminal with their day off.\n\nFor breakfast the options are limited. There is the Down Home Diner which is decent but I'm not kvelling about it. Some of the stands do breakfast but I haven't really tried them. I finally tried Profi's Creperie and it is pretty good.\n\nMy suggestions about food if you're there one time during a Philly visit: If it is Wednesday-Saturday, go to the Hatville Farms deli counter and get a smoked turkey special with iced-tea and potato chips. Hatville Farms is one of the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants and I swear that the smoked turkey special is the best thing in all of Reading Terminal Market. Plus, they have stools at their counter so you don't have to go looking for a seat. \n\nIf it is Sunday-Tuesday, go to DiNic's Roast Pork and Beef. The line will be long but it moves fairly quick. Get the roast pork Italiano with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone. That's a Philly sandwich! \n\nReading Terminal Market, you are what makes New Yorkers jealous of Philadelphia!", "date": "2010-04-17 13:43:18"}

Let me count the ways:\n\n1. Iovine Brothers Produce - Even at the cheapest of supermarkets, I couldn't get a whole bag of the freshest, highest quality vegetables for $5. Same goes to the nuts and snacks on the southern wall, where else can you buy them in such a state of quality at such prices?\n\n2. Godshall's Poultry - Instead of the yellowed, hormoned chicken you get from the supermarket, these are the freshest, tastiest chicken you can find in the city. And fresh chickens do make a difference in taste. Of course, they do have ducks, quails, turkeys and eggs.\n\n3. Martin's and John Yi's is where I get my meat and seafood, Martin's is always a few bucks cheaper and John Yi captures me with their neon signs.\n\n4. 4 Seasons Juice Bar has the tastiest fruit smoothies and blends around. My favorite is Pineapple (for sweetness) + Banana (for texture) + Orange (for taste). Nothing beats a 20oz No.4 in a hot summer day.\n\n5. For your dessert needs, Flying Monkey has the best cupcakes and lemon bars in town. Termini Brothers has a killer chocolate covered banana on a crescent cookie. You can also visit the ladies at Famous 4th for a fresh baked cookie. For something completely evil, you can go to the Amish bakery for a cinnamon roll with nuts AND frosting.\n\n6. Shanghai Gourmet's American Chinese food is as good as any place in Chinatown. Try their fried rice or the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, it's not on their menu but the jumbo shrimps in the silky luscious sauce is to die for. (gulp)\n\n7. The Spice Terminal will fulfill most of your gourmet needs. Bee Natural has a wide variety of honeys. For cheese and charcuterie, you can visit Salumeria and if not for anything else, go to By George for their pasta sauces, they'll even sell you pizza dough if you want to make something at home. \n\nIt's a vibrant place with lots of other places to discover and it's a great place to walk and browse when you have the time. Just don't stand in the middle of the aisle and block traffic, it can be crowded. Cell phone reception can be on the low side, and it's hard for the working folks to pick up groceries on their way home since most of the shop will close business around 5, but there's the weekend. The Amish generally won't be there from Sundays to Wednesdays but most shops open Mondays to Saturdays and some even open on Sundays.", "date": "2010-05-14 22:26:47"}

I like farmers markets and I find the one outside of the Penn bookstore on 36th & Walnut or the one in Rittenhouse Square just don't cut it for me.  Reading is open all year-round and even has student discounts on Wednesdays and Sundays (just bring your ID)!  \n\nI've ordered porterhouse and NY strip steaks and ground sirloin (3 lbs for $7.50!) from the butcher shop right near the entrance (Giunta's Prime Shop)--the steaks were awesome even when I pan-cooked them a couple days later b/c I was too lazy to go to the grill.  The whole chickens from Godshall's Poultry LLC are awesome and my sister who roasts whole chickens all the time says these are the best chickens she's ever seen--very little fat and the meat tastes great.  \n\nFour Seasons Juice Bar is off the hook.  The most amazing fruit drinks I've ever had (and I'm not crazy about fruit or juice--Jamba Juice and Smoothies King are ok but this place is really unique).  If you like super sweet drinks/juices or smoothies, this place isn't for you because they are SUPER fresh and I doubt they add any sugar to their blends.  Out front, they have boxes and boxes of fresh fruit and vegetables (peaches, mangoes, strawberries, carrots, broccoli, ginger).  They have crazy blends like carrot, mango and spinach and the like.  For each 16 oz. drink, they mix in 4 whole carrots.  I stick to pineapple, strawberries, and mangoes.  \n\nI get kalamata olives all the time (the best I've found in Philly) from the cheese shop in the middle of the Terminal at the Salumeria (their cheeses aren't so great--tasteless mozzarella for example).  The turkey w/ mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, etc. from the Original Turkey is surprisingly tasty.  I didn't like the pastrami reuben from Hershels East Side Deli--there was no Russian dressing, just some sauerkraut, tons of fat-laden meat and the bread fell apart immediately (this was definitely no Famous 4th Street or Rachael's Nosheri).  \n\nMy default grocery store is Iovine Brothers Produce since they are the biggest and freshest in the Terminal but sometimes I'll go to the smaller produce shops like OK Lee Produce for some greens and basic fruits.  I've gotten tuna steaks, king crab legs, scallops and salmon fillets from John Yi Fish Market and Wan's Seafood.  They are both fine but I'm not a huge seafood person so I can't tell you the nuisances between the two.  The market has an ice cream shop and tons of more restaurants.  It's a great place to browse, grab lunch or do your weekly grocery shopping!\n\nI just bought $50 worth of cheese and cured meats and balsamic vinegar from Downtown Cheese (the owner is also an artist!) so I'll let you know how they are!", "date": "2010-09-02 04:34:18"}

I saw an episode of Man v. Food and applied myself to what he was praising and backing up with his and his mothers life claiming that Denic's Roast Pork Sandwich is like no other. Instantaneously, my mouth began to water at the meticulous placement of the sharp provolone and the boiling concoction from which the roast pork was being pulled out from. So, I decided to turn off my TV, send the dvd back to netflix, and go purchase two tickets from LA to philly just to try this god sent meat sandwich!\n\nWhen I got there, the butterflies in my stomach churned quicker and quicker by every mile; my excitement was no exaggeration. As I stepped foot in the heaven bazaar I wasted no time searching for this legendary Denic's! I skim past the array of markets and hustle my way to Denic's. As my cousin and I wait in the never-ending line, we talk amongst ourselves and take pictures to take back home because we definitely cannot take the roast pork with us! As the line pulled us in closer to the cashier, we looked and saw a COCKROACH climbing up the glistening Denic's sign; the sight of that disease ridden insect dismayed my presence. Never-the-less, we order our food; we didn't spend $500 and cover all this road to get stalled by a god damn cockroach! Before I took my first passionate bite, I accustomed myself and made a pledge on the plane ride to not cry at the overload of deliciousness. Again, to my dismay, I bit and was about to GAG! WTF was Adam thinking?! I got exactly what he said! Roast pork sandwich, with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe! Sheer disgust and disappointment is all that rained down my face. Bitter, like biting into handful of Arugula! The only pro about the sandwich would be the barely noticeable presence of the sharp provolone.\n\nAll-in-all, it was a very interesting trip. I also visited a few other places that I saw on Man v. Food, however, those did not fail me. Denic's might be a delicious place to eat, but, I guess, my Californian tongue cannot handle the extreme flavors of the east. Judge it for yourself.", "date": "2010-09-29 01:34:52"}

I spent about 4 hours here, stopping everywhere from Delilah's for her famous mac n' cheese (or so says Oprah and as seen on Throwdown), the Amish stands, the Jewish deli, bakeries, spice shops, etc. \n\nI only stopped to eat at a few places, the most notable being Herschel's East Side Deli. Honestly, best hot pastrami I've ever had. Hands down. I live in an area that's laden with Jewish delis, and none of them can surpass Herschel's hot pastrami. I even asked the guy at the counter for the scraps he was cutting off so I can walk around and eat them, they were like candy in meat form.\n\nOf course we stopped at Delilah's for her mac n' cheese. Honestly ---- GREASY. Really greasy. There was nothing creamy and decadent about it. I really wish I liked it, but considering I paid $5 for a small cup, that was a major disappointment. I had a bite, my mom had a bite and into the trash it went. Delilah did, however, lose to Bobby Flay on the Throwdown episode, so go figure... Because Bobby always loses to good competitors. \n\nOut of all the bakeries I stopped at, I'd have to say I like Flying Monkey the best. I had their red velvet whoopie pie which was DELICIOUS. Try that. They also had some \"extreme\" cake that was like 72398173981273 layers that looked like a total cake monstrosity, but I guess I'll save trying that for next time I visit, and so long as I bring a small army of people, too. \n\nI also went through two huge cups of hot cider at Old City Coffee.

Isn't that child labor!?  I don't support that.\n\nI think some order needs to be defined.  They should only allow local produce and local stores to resell here.  The Amish people shouldn't be shoved into tiny isles and corners, they should have nice booths setup to display their beautiful produce.  There was hours of hard labor put into growing that Napa cabbage.  It was gigantic and I wanted to buy it to bring home but I'd never finish eating it within a week.\n\nI came in search of lunch and when I smelled the pork from Tony DaNic's, I quickly got into line.  This is not to be missed people.  If you come into this market, you'd better not leave without a hoagie.\n\n*There should be an Amish country reality TV show.  They could bring in outsiders and see how long they survive.  Similar to Survivor, whoever can live w/o technology the longest wins.  If I were a contestant, I would totally corrupt them.

I waited in lines for a roasted pork sandwhich and the line was long as hell but to my disappointed the taste was bland.

Open daily from 8am to 5pm, it's paradise for those who are hungry, enjoy a plethora of eating options, and cash-strapped.  From Amish Dutch bakeries and pretzels to Thai and Chinese to Soul Food and Italian pizza and pasta, you'll find a wide variety of cuisines for breakfast, lunch, and everything in between for under $7.  Oh yes, you can also grocery shop here - produce, meats, and seafood galore.  With over 90 vendors, it's overwhelming if you're hungry because almost everything looks and smells good.  These are some of my favorites and so-so stops:\n\n\nBieler's Bakery: Amish bakery with cakes, bread, whoopie pies, and rolls.  You can see the workers bake the various rolls fresh that morning.  Try their famous sticky buns with raisins - deliciously sweet.\n\nBy George Pizza: I loved the Spinach, roasted red pepper cheese slice.  They reheat it in their oven for you so it's toasty and cheesy.  \n\nDelilah's Southern Cooking: The corn bread was disappointingly cold and crumbly, but the fried chicken was tender and the mac & cheese was flavorful and rich.     \n\n4th Street Cookie Company: Freshly baked and thick chewy cookie.  I loved my Chocolate Chip with Walnuts.  If you want to combine sweet and sweet, there's the the Chocolate Dipped Chocolate Chip Cookie.\n\nTorini Brothers: yummy baked Italian goods, especially the delectable Amaretto cookies.  At $20 per lb, it's worth every expensive almond flavored bite.  \n\nDutch Eating Place: A popular Amish brunch spot - the prices are cheap for a hearty breakfast.  The blueberry pancakes are fluffy and decent, and when visiting Philly, try the breakfast \"scrapple\" to try at least once - crisped ground pork and grits.      \n\nFlying Monkey: Drool-worthy bakery with more whoopie pies than I've ever seen.  In addition to my richly sweet and dense Red Velvet whoopie pie with cream cheese frosting, there are also the flavors of: classic, cookies and cream, snickerdoodle, Elvis, and Lavender & honey.  \n\nKamal's: Middle eastern fare along with variety of fresh squeezed juice combinations that will give Jamba Juice a run for its money.  The Mint Lemonade hit the spot.\n\nPearl's Oyster Bar: In addition to trying Malpeque oysters, which tasted quite fresh, I also enjoyed the Lobster and Crab Bisque - creamy and savory with fresh chunks of crab on top.  \n\nThe Grill @ Smuckers: Delicious Amish cooked Breakfast Sausage Sandwich.  The egg was fresh, sausage patty juicy and savory, and the melted American cheese with fresh slightly sweet bread roll made a filling and delicious breakfast.  And it's served all day.    \n\nDown Home Diner: Average comfort and diner food, although I found The Country Benny (poached eggs, sausage, buttermilk biscuit, and country gravy) unappetizingly drowning in bland gravy.  \n\nCity Coffee: for your morning coffee fix, my iced latte was nothing special, but it still satisfies that caffeine urge.  \n\nMiller's Twist: Creamy and not-too-sweet Strawberry Milkshake comes with a free Amish baked pretzel.  The soft and slightly salted pretzel, with its golden baked surface, is tasty with the cheese dip.     \n\nThe Reading Market (Redding) fills up at the popular noon-time lunch rush, especially since it's located smack in City Center with several workers in the area.  It's more spaced out and a comfortable experience earlier in the morning, unless you don't mind squeezing shoulder to shoulder with your fellow Philly friends for some cheap, good eats.", "date": "2011-04-21 14:35:22"}

For $5.50 each, we got a generous helping of spicy shrimp curry (amazingly flavorful and spicy!) and veggie pad thai (honestly, the veggie pad thai didn't do it for me - not moist enough).

You could buy meats and groceries here, but I'm not sure that's the focus here, unless you want Amish meats, which are good quality and cheap.  Bathrooms are not bad - Pike Place bathrooms are worse.\n\nPro-tip:  anyone can go into the beer garden, even kids, and you can bring food in.

The famous Tommy DiNic's is in the market and their pork sandwiches are must haves.

There's even a Vegan baker here.  As soon as you walk in, the aroma of all sorts of baked goods just punches you in face, in a good way!  Beiler's is a good spot to indulge yourself in the world of buttery goodness.\n\nOld City Cafe has got some bomb coffee and there's even a vendor selling fresh squeezed juices to quench your thirst!\n\nIt can get really crowded during lunch, since the convention center is right next door so be prepared to fight through some crowds or stand around to wait for a table.\n\nDefinitely take sometime to walk through the whole market.

My only regret is that I didn't find out about this place sooner. Oh how I wish I had known about the wondrous treasures tucked inside this well disguised market full of fabulousness when I worked just 5 blocks away. My taste buds would love me but my backside (and perhaps my husband) might not have enjoyed the consequences of my overindulgence. \n\nBelieve them when they say this place is packed on the weekends.  The little old lady I almost ran over with my stroller can atest to this.  IN true Philly fashion she shot me a dirty look, mouthed some expletives and kept it moving.  Other than that , how could you not love this place? For starters, there are approximately 75 vendors in this locale so even the pickiest of people should be able to find SOMETHING they enjoy (Unless they're from NYC, then all bets are off because you know NYC has thee best of everything *insert eye roll*). The place is cramped, let's just put that out there. They say 100,000 people come through the market per week but honestly it feels more like 100k per day. You're sure to trip over tourists stopping and gawking in the aisles as local people trying to pass by get annoyed (sorry Grandma). Grab yourself a Tenant Directory (from either a bathroom or the market information booth) and it will help guide you to wherever your interests may take you. The directory divides businesses into the following categories: \n\n*Bakeries \n*Beverages \n*Dairy & Cheese \n*Flowers & Plants (one vendor) \n*Housewares, Books, Crafts, etc. \n*Meats & Poultry \n*Seafood \n*Pennsylvania Dutch \n*Produce \n*Restaurants \n*Specialty Foods \n\nBe advised that 30% of the tenants are closed on Sunday, this includes ALL of the Dutch Merchants (they only work Wed-Sat).   The market itself is open 8 to 6 from Mon-Sat and 9 to 5 on Sun.  \n\nTreat yourself to a delicious pretzel (and fresh lemonade) at Miller's Twist. \nGet the famous apple dumpling at Dutch Eating Place. \nIf you're into the Oprah hype, stop by Delilah's for the \"best ever mac & cheese\" (I can't attest to that and hell, Oprah looks like she'll eat anything to me so I don't know if she's exactly a qualified food source) \n\nYou'll find Asian cuisine, Soul Food, Ice Cream, baked teats, cheesteaks, and everything you need to get the complete Philadelphia experience. \n\nPark anywhere in the Parkway Garage at 12th & Filbert Streets and park for $4. \nBring your parking ticket to the market with you and after making a purchase of $10 or more ANY merchant will validate your ticket (upon request). \nYou automatically receive flat rate of $4 for UP TO 2 hours of parking (anything over that and you're subject to the astronomical garage rates). \n\nIf you're not in for a drive just take the train. You can exit either rail line at 13th street, head east towards 12th street and make a left onto 12th. You can't miss the signs and you won't want to miss the food!", "date": "2011-07-03 15:18:21"}

Seriously, can you think of a better market in any other US city? I can't. This place has it all. From Amish to Thai, to South Philly, to Greek to Chinese, you could spend days eating in the Market (and I have). I plan to give specific reviews for each vendor, so I won't go into too much detail about my favs, but the market itself is a serious Philadelphia highlight and treasure. For those that have never been, the Market is located around 12th and Arch, is indoor, and used to share it's venue with a train station. The market underwent major renovations in the 1990's, and has about 80 shops and stands that sell prepared food, and the raw materials ie. meat, fish, produce, etc.  \n\nMajor highlights for me include Termini Brothers for pastries and cannolis, Iovines for produce, Martins for bacon and sausages, the Asian place that does smoothies, Bassetts for ice cream, and the Cajun spot (Beck's?) for gumbo when I get that hankering. Jack's Down home Diner is also a go to if I have had enough, and need a booth to sit down and relax. I am usually in the Market on weekends, and do have to note that many stands are closed on Sundays, especially anything Amish. Saturdays can be, in the words of the Bodes, BANANAS. When I say the place gets packed it can be an understatement, so be prepared for crowds, and watch where you stand. You will be pushed, shoved, bumped, and stepped on if you do not pay attention. There is nothing worse than an obese, fanny packed tourist clogging the narrow aisles declaring \"Look kids, its one of those Aim-ish guys!\" \n\nDespite the crowds, there is always something happening in the common spaces, such as live music, or if your lucky, the occasional Philly sports celeb signing autographs. I believe I bought some salsa from Mitch Williams a few years back. Bathrooms are clean, but can be packed. Also the RTM is super close to Chinatown. Parking can be a bit of an issue, but of late I have discovered some great metered spots not too far away that have been pretty empty. I am not giving up those secrets, though. On a closing note- If you are thinking about getting a DiNic's pork sandwich, either get there around opening or closing, or be prepared to wait. I've seen lines with well over 50 people in them. Also, in my opinion, the sandwich is not as good as Paesano's (see my review), so maybe you can keep the dream alive, and hit up the Italian Market, as well.  I've done a double market day only a few times, but have filled my fridge for weeks.  Good luck, grasshopper.", "date": "2011-07-05 16:33:54"}

About 90% of the things sold here you can get around the corner from your house at the local grocers.  I was there Sat.  Very crowded.

This one of the reasons I chose to visit was because of all the hoopla I heard about Bassett's.  Two baby scoops of ice cream for $5.  Braums ice cream that I used to visit was 10x's better and much cheaper.  Ben and Jerry's tastes even better than this.  \n \nMuch of the cooked food here is over priced and underseasoned.  It reminded me of an upgraded mall Food Court.  \n\nParking was $8 for 2 hrs.  Driving around RTM is typical horrendous  hectic downtown driving.   \n\nOne of the few places that I did like was Herschels East side deli.  The roast and corned beef were worth the price, very tender and moist.  \n\nAt any rate, save yourself the hassle and gas.  Why fight your way thru a crowded food court for chicken, fish or ice cream when you can get that almost hassle free at the local grocers.

Is there anything sadder than when you go to lunch at reading terminal on Monday hoping for some apple dumblings, scrapple, assorted freshly baked breads and fresh deli meats only to find 1/4 of the market is barren and cold?

Visiting Philly for the first time, I had a completely different vision.  I thought it would be similar to this big indoor Flea Market with a bunch of people trying to hustle me for a fake gucci bag or some knock off sunglasses.  I was pleasantly surprised to walk over from the Loews hotel to see a bunch of men and women in Pilgrim outfits at different vendors serving, baking and displaying almost anything I wanted to eat.  Cheesesteaks, chocoloates, cookies, pretzels, a produce market, fish market,  bakery . . . . the smell of chocolate cookies and fried onions never smelt so good.\n\nI walked, but parking seemed easy.  I believe if you purchase 10 dollars worth of stuff at the market you get 3 dollar parking on Filbert and 12th, so that is real convenient for those of you driving in.  The place is huge so go in with an open mind and be ready to try an assortment of stuff at your own pace.  The food is delicious.\n\nThe only knock I got on this place is the hours of operation.  They close at 6 p.m.  A place like this in the middle of City Center in Philadelphia should be open to atleast 9 p.m. . . . I can only imagine how packed it is on the weekend when people aren't rushing from work trying to make the closing.  Also by me going on a Wednesday morning around 9 a.m. . . . not everything was open.\n\nOverall, if you are visiting from out of town I would say this is a MUST do in Philly . . . anything and everything you thought of eating in Philly is right here and with reasonable prices.  I am very much a fan of this place.  Just don't expect to go here after a long day of touring, because it might not be open.", "date": "2011-07-21 08:31:19"}

Average prices of beer on tap. $10 for two Blue Moons and we got our parking validated (:\n4) What do you get when you mix seafood, Asian flavors, and Western subs/sandwiches together? You get an Asian fusion, seafoody Fat Korean to pair with that refreshing Blue Moon. (YES they have fat sandwiches at the market!)\n5) If you park in the lot across the street, parking can be validated by a vendor once you purchase $10. However, this is only worth it if you spend less than 3 hours in the market. Otherwise it's a flat rate of $28 between 3 and 12 hours.\n6) If it's hot out, come to Bassett's early in the morning to beat the rush. There tends to be a line at the counter while people try different flavors and other nonsense. This makes the line unbearably long.\n\nReading Terminal is such a nice escape from the city, and it's such a large foodie haven. I'm afraid that after frequenting RT, my DC Eastern Market may not be enough for me now...", "date": "2011-08-09 14:59:27"}

They were legit, down to the garb and beards. Lots of respect there and I definitely plan on patronizing them regularly. There were these amazing looking pies in one booth that had me salivating. I had already had lunch so I skipped on it but next time I know... I am going to have pie, FOR LUNCH. \n\nIt was unfortunately packed and full of tourists (me included) which made navigating a little frustrating and difficult from time to time. Which led to the misfortune of getting my wallet jacked by some pick-pocketing asshats who double teamed by pushing me around in a busy corridor. Beware of crowds near the exits, keep your bags in front of you or stuff your wallet in your underwear, do not take out money at the ATM there cause they will case you... it happened to me. Apparently it is a problem there and I didn't know any better. \n\nBut overall? WOW. It was a cornucopia of culinary eye porn that was a game of \"just the tip\". I want more. I plan on going back to the crime scene despite my apprehension. No one, not even a wallet stealing prick is gonna keep me from such a killer resource.

Also, if you're a student one of the produce places  (forget which aisle it's in) offers a 10% student discount. Because it's terribly crowded otherwise. Lunch time here is pretty crazy.

Their various breads--peach, apple cinnamon etc are YUMMY and they make the best gingerbread I have ever had. Oh and the apple dumplings with heavy cream...I think I'm going to go out right now and get myself one, haha. The international cheese place has a great selection at reasonable rates--it stocked all the English cheeses that I love (Blue Stilton, Wensleydale, Double Gloucester). The Thai place is wonderful too. The red curry was too much for just one meal--I ate it over two.

It  seemed kind of overpriced for what we received but the chef was friendly and appreciated our business. \n\nFamous 4th Street cookies were closing down, so we purchased a few cookies for a dollar a pop.

I know; put the ten (10) most important things you need to know all in one place.  So, especially if you are a 1st timer, read on.\n\n1. Be prepared to embrace the crowds.  It's part of the Reading Terminal experience.  Think about it.  All those folks are there because the place is so amazing!\n\n2. Don't visit on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday.  Why you ask?  There are over a dozen Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish) vendors that are definitely worth visiting.  They have special hours and don't open on these days.  It would be a mistake not to see them.\n\n3. If you want the very best deals make sure you end your visit during the last hour of each day.  That would be between 5:00 and 6:00 PM Monday -Saturday and 4:00 to 5:00 PM on Sunday.\n\n4. If you are a foodie be prepared to be overwhelmed, stunned, amazed, and generally blown away.  You won't be able to do it justice in two (2) hours.  Think three (3) or more.\n\n5. Speaking of two (2) hours, it will cost you $4 for that amount of time at the 12th & Filbert garage.  All you need to do is spend $10 and any vendor will validate your ticket.  Even better is to not park at all and take public transportation.  \n\n6. Check the website for cool events especially to see the live music schedule.  http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/events/\n\n7. Some folks say the place is touristy and they are partially correct.  That's true of some of the vendors but anyone with half a brain can spot them in a second.  If that's not your thing just walk on by.\n\n8. If you want to stay in the market and have an adult libation, check out Molly Malloy's.  It's a great place for a beer.\n\n9. If you are thinking about lunch at prime time (11:30-1:00), please think again.  And then think again and again.  Trust me; it's complete and utter craziness.  Eat early or eat late.\n\n10. Last but not least let's talk Tommy DiNic's as this legendary emporium deserves special mention.  I know, I know, you saw Man vs. Food and you want \"The Sandwich.\"  Is it worth it?  Yeah, it is.  Stroll the market and stop back occasionally to check on the length of the line.  If you see it below twenty five (25) folks, go for it.

We saw this place on the food network, and decided we'd hunt it down once we got to Philly.  We were delighted to realize it was right next to our hotel.  The biggest problem?  There were so many great places to choose from that I felt like I missed out on a ton!  You'll deal with crowds when you are there for a convention, but there's lots of seating and lots of choices.  While I had several rushed experiences for breakfasts and lunches during the conference, I came in for a more leisurely walk through on Saturday morning, and enjoyed it so much.  What a great mixture of a fantastic food court and a fantastic market.  Loved it.  Can't wait to head back to Philly just to come back here.  My recommendations would be to try coming during off hours if you hate crowds, there are definitely times of day when it's more quiet, and you have your pick of lineless vendors.", "date": "2012-04-04 14:48:25"}

Wow! What an awesome place. It's like a food court/farmer's market on steroids. \n\nWe walked through the entire place to check it out and decide where we wanted to eat. We decided on Olympia Gyros (for the guys) and the falafel place (for me). I got my meal quickly, a falafel platter with falafel, salad, pita, hummus, and tabboulah. I also got a tropical smoothie. All of this for about $12. One thing that confused me is that you get your food and eat, THEN pay. I wanted to carry mine away so I could eat with the people I was with, so I asked for the bill and then headed out.\n\nEverything was fresh and tasty. I especially appreciated the smoothie - they were juicing the fruits right there. The guys liked their gyros and fries too. The lady working there was nice as she let me sit and eat even though I hadn't bought my food there, and even cleared my trash for me.\n\nThe amounts of meat and seafood here were crazy. I have never seen so much. Lots of produce - I can imagine even more when the summer comes around. Some standout booths were:\n\n- a shop dedicated entirely to cookbooks. Cookbooks unlike I've ever seen before, for everything under the mood and more. \n\n- A honey shop, with products made from honey, plus several varieties to buy\n\n- COOKIES. PLEASE, Yelp Philly, help me out here. We bought cookies from a place that had very unique flavors, like caramel and raspberry chocolate. Some of them were available halfway dipped in chocolate. They were the best cookies I've ever tasted. I can't remember the name of the shop, and wanted to see if they are online for me to order. I checked the webpage but none of the bakeries ring a bell. I think they sold more than cookies. I'm desperate! Please PM me! \n\nWe spent more than enough to get our parking ticket validated. $4 for 2 hours was a great deal, seeing the prices of parking if you didn't have it validated. Wow.. now I know why there are such parking issues there that they shoot \"Parking Wars\" in the city! I sort of wished that I was going to run into a PPA employee so I could mention it.. hehe.

Maggie Malloys just opened and I hear great things! \n\nLooking for natural tea and health cures? Herbiary (right around the corner from the diner) has a great selection of teas and natural products and cures. I believe they also take LevelUp.\n\nLooking for wine?

We definitely enjoyed the soft pretzels, especially the stuffed breakfast pretzels.", "date": "2012-05-13 06:48:54"}

I get people browsing, cool, but i was starving an in a rush to find something.\n\nVariety, its got it. You can get all types of food here from Sushi to Chocolate and Deli meats. I chose to eat at By George (no good) check out my review on it.\n\nAfter i battled the crowd and got my food i sat at one of the public tables. It had food all over it and the ground. The area was generally dingy and gross. Also i noticed a few homeless (or so they looked) roaming around inside.

Out of all the times I've been to Philly, I couldn't recall the details of Reading Terminal. Bf and I came here for weekend and we decided to come here for lunch on a Sunday. Sadly, Sunday means that the most notable vendor, Dutch Landing Co is closed (this is the Amish place every talks about). We talked by their booth and saw a delicious menu featuring chicken pot pie, blueberry pancakes, and that type of thing. \n\nWe tried to eat as much as we could.  The famous sandwich shop here is the Pork place (sorry I don't know the actual name)- this is the one that serves the Italian bread hoagies with pulled pork, roast pork with broccoli rabe (which my bf got, with roasted sweet peppers), and beef..brisket? I don't really eat pork so I had a tiny bit. It seems watery and lean; the rabe was very crunchy and yummy. My bf loved it. It was some $11 with a drink. \n\nI went to Frank's chicken to get a side of homemade mac and cheese (yummy, very cheesy but not crunchy as I'd like) and 2 pieces of BBQ grilled chicken (not too sweet, but more like a rotisserie chicken- very yummy but nothing I hadn't had before- hot, with crispy skin and juicy), I wanted two homemade pierogis but they'd just ran out. Came to some $7. \n\nWe walked around and sampled the jambalaya at the Cajun place, which was really spicy and yummy- I would have ordered from here again. Typical long lines included the pretzels and cheesesteaks. (We had pretzels from the same place that does chocolate covered stuff in the corner.. but sadly it was too stale. I'd get the famous pretzels off the street somewhere) \n\n There is also that famous chocolate shop (another) that features pictures of Andrew Zimmerman (funnily) eating a chocolate covered onion (and not liking it). Instead, we sweet-ed it up with a big gooey chocolate chip cookie with walnuts from the 4th St Baking Company (cookie place near the entrance). \n\nWhile my travels have taken me to wonderful markets like Pike Place in Seattle and Granville in Vancouver..I've overlooked this wonderful little place close-by in Philly.", "date": "2012-05-29 01:15:51"}

They must be good because as I was searching yelp reviews, most of the individual places are rated four stars. \n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is like, since I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn around the corner. It seemed street parking is VERY limited, so parking in a garage is probably best. I don't know the hourly cost ($33/day), but the same parking garage I used for the hotel can be used for the market (entrance is off of 11th or Arch streets). Apparently there is a deal right now that you can now park up to two hours nearby in a garage (not sure which one) for $4 with vendor validation. Perhaps this is a way to gain more business, but it seemed people were in full force either buying food at the grocery stalls or sitting down to eat. \n\nI noticed there are some places only open in the morning versus not open in the afternoon for lunch, so be forewarned! Your best bet is to use the Yelp app as a tool to figure out the operation hours of the different places. Good luck!", "date": "2012-09-09 02:39:47"}

Very attractive displays.\n\n-Beef Jerky!  Cheese!  These stores are near each other too and have great unique selections and also offer up free samples.

Lots of the vendors participate in it within the market.\n\nIf you are going for the Amish baked goods, they're closed on Monday. Otherwise, go early and try their apple fritters- yum! The donuts are pretty good, too. The cakes and pies are just meh. \n\nTootsie's Salad Express is pretty decent for a pay-by-weight salad bar with way more than just salads (think Chinese food). \n\nThere is also a great little spice store in here that is great and also has a fantastic coffee bean selection. The people who work here are super helpful, too. \n\nThere's also a bar in there, so if you're in mixed company and someone would rather have a beer than fight the crowd, well, there' truly is something for everyone!", "date": "2012-12-11 19:40:28"}

Of note, the Sunday early afternoon crowd definitely seemed to be made up with a lot more tourists compared to the Monday crowd, as it was considerably less crowded and chaotic on a regular workday.  Reading Terminal Market also offers a numerous food counters serving a wide array of regional and international cuisines from which you can sample.  It can get very congested with customers/tourists especially around lunchtime in large part due the place being packed with vendor stalls and narrow aisles between them.  However, it's worth your time to check it out.", "date": "2013-03-15 11:13:38"}

Do you/your friends hate crowds? Forget it. Just don't even try. I brought extended family here and they got so overwhelmed we left and they decided it would be a good idea to go to Field House for cheesesteaks. A part of me died that day.\n\n2. Is it Sunday or Monday? Go home. That's where the Amish are, and you don't want to miss them.\n\n3. Now that you/your normal friends are psyched for the experience, enter, be amazed, and maybe take a lap or two around to work up an appetite. \n\n4. Stop at DiNic's for the Best Sandwich in America talk about how this was on Man vs Food. (Roast pork, broccoli rabe, sharp provolone.) It's worth the line. Split it between at least two people. You're gonna need to save room. (Maybe let other friends get what they spotted/are in the mood for, too, if they're being good. I hear the Rib place, Meltkraft is great fancy grilled cheeses, and Hershel's is always good for some giant deli brisket/pastrami/corned beef sandwiches.)\n\n5. Go to Termini Brothers. Get a cannoli. Look across the aisle at the other chocolate place. Talk about how weird chocolate covered onions are and how awesome chocolate cheesesteaks are (once you realize there's no cheese or steak in there).\n\n6. Go to Bassett's. Get ice cream from oldest ice cream company in America.\n\n7. Hit up 4th Street Cookie Company. Get cookies.\n\n8. Go to Amish guy. Try juice samples. Buy some juice.\n\n9. Go to Tubby Olive, try lots and lots of olive oils and vinegars. Buy a little bottle for whoever is the unlucky person who did not take this trip to Philadelphia with your friends.\n\n10. Get some cheese from some cheese counters for later. Ask them what type of cheese to get.\n\n11. Get some produce from Iovine's for later. If it's Wednesday (or Sunday, but it shouldn't be: See #2), use your student ID for a discount.\n\nENJOY PHILLY!", "date": "2013-04-10 04:36:09"}

Salumeria is your stop for cheeses and cured meats like pancetta, or a mouthwatering hoagie. Fair Food Farmstand is generally pretty overpriced (13.99 a lb for garlic? I don't care if its organic that is outrageous) but I don't know where else to get raw milk and I refuse to drink pasteurized if I can help it. Head Nut is pretty awesome, a small fairly new bulk spice and nut shop that has quite a bit of variety. Love that you can buy very small amounts of spices (whole or preground) here as they have quantity/price stages, and the best part is that it's CHEAP. Don't be suckered into buying one of those tiny 8 dollar spice grinders from Jonathan Best; go to Head Nut. Thai Kitchen has a lot of asian ingredients for sale like holy basil and fish sauce, and their cheap thai curries aren't too bad either.\n\nThere are of course many food stands, which range from okay to good, but those can be a bit tourist trappy and expensive. Places definitely not to miss: DiNic's (overpriced but still a damn great roast pork sandwich, go early though they have a tendency to run out of broccoli rabe), the Rib Stand, Smucker's Grill (absolute best breakfast sandwiches right here, get the scrapple egg and cheese, you'll thank me later. Or walk to the other side of the counter and buy some scrapple to take home, seriously, it's the best scrapple I've ever had.), Miller's Twist (sorry philly pretzels, you just got your ass kicked), Beck's for delicious po'boys, get the fried oyster, Herschel's for an awesome (but expensive) reuben or pastrami special on challah.\n\nI would not reccomend down home diner, not sure why people seem to love it, the couple times ive eaten there the food was just sloppy and in one case I got regular (frozen) fries instead of the sweet potato fries that were supposed to come with my sandwich. Seriously just go to midtown II on 11th and sansom if you want a diner experience that badly. The Dutch Eating Place does a pretty tasty burger, but the fries were really disappointing. Fresh cut but soggy and oily, not crispy at all. \n\nPersonally I don't go to many of the restaurants any more, I'm reviewing RTM as a place to get your grocery shopping done, and on those terms you really can't beat it for the price and quality in center city.\n\nOne side note and why i knock off a star, the fishmongers don't appear that great to me in terms of freshness and price. Maybe their fish is fresher in the mornings, but I'd rather go down to Ippolito's for cheaper seafood that I KNOW is fresh. this just an observation based on sight I have not bought any fish from RTM so maybe I am wrong.\n\nOverall it's a great place to do grocery shopping or grab a bite to eat if you don't mind the overpriced-ness of the food stands, stop going to Whole Paycheck, go to the Reading Terminal Market.", "date": "2013-05-01 22:04:35"}

For a place like Reading, which can feel like it houses just about everything under its roof, we might think in similar terms... let's try \"frequent, few and forego\"\n\nnow, despite having gone to Reading at least once a week for nearly a year now, I have to admit I haven't given a thorough tour of every shop represented, so the following are just selected from what I have been able to consider:\n\nFrequent:\n\nDutch Eating Place - I would use any excuse whatever to stop here. \n\nGodshall's Poutry - I've never been disappointed by the meat I get here. Of course if you drop into Asian markets down the road, you'll notice the price difference. \n\nIovine's Brothers and OK Lee tend to have competitive prices on most of their staples, but their grab bags generally cover different territory. If you're fishing for inspiration, it never hurts to swing by both shops\n\nJohn Yi Fish Market - I've never actually stopped by Golden Fish, I guess it simply happened out of chance. I've had cooked and raw food from Wan's and I was never impressed. John Yi does the job for me.\n\nFew\n\n12th St Cantina - they sell guacamole, salsas, and a variety of tortillas to go, which is convenient since they are generally freshly made and great quality. They also have pre-made foods that are kept cold that would make for a convenient meal at home. \n\nBassett's Ice Cream - Few if you can restrain yourself! The WHYY is fantastic, and not only because I love Terry Gross. \n\nBee Natural - Love the raw honey. Candles are not my thing so I've never shopped for more than honey.\n\nBy George! Pizza - love the pizzas I've tried, and they have a variety of pre-made side dishes that will kick up the variety to dinner without the added time investment. \n\nL. Halteman - I've had bought their meat before and was satisfied with the freshness and quality. What I primarily come here for, however, is their smoked dog bone, which my dog is absolutely addicted to. I haven't really seen this offered anywhere else and my dog doesn't really go for rawhide so this helps me control her plaque and spoil her rotten.\n\nMartin's Quality Meats and Sausages - They have 20+ varieties freshly made sausages that they have out everyday. Decent selection of meats otherwise. The reason why I don't come here for all my meats is because they don't cut their pieces for you. Meaning, the last two times I've come here for a pound of something, I walked away with anywhere from a quarter to nearly half a pound extra. This makes it harder to portion for meals, so I tend to only drop it when I know I wouldn't mind the difference.\n\nMetropolitan Bakery - I don't eat bread much but I've enjoyed the few I've picked up from here. They also sell their bread for 50% off if you stop in late enough, though the selection dwindles the later the day as is expected.\n \nForego\n\nBlue Mountain Vineyards Cellars - sells a lot of things that have nothing to do with wine. Wines are overpriced. \n\nThe Down Home Diner - Food was pretty disgusting.\n\nGiunta's Prime Shop - nothing wrong with their meats, just a $10 card minimum that bugs. As someone who doesn't like to carry cash and does buy groceries as needed each day, I tend to skop Giunta's altogether.\n\nJonathan's Best - GENERALLY forego, use in emergencies. \n\nThe Tubby Olive - a bit gimmicky in my opinion. I like to go with a good olive oil and simply infuse on the shelf or on the stove. I can't really see the necessity for treated \"gourmet\" oils. \n\nFor whatever else residing in Reading, I haven't experienced quite enough of them to merit a review. The rest will have to wait for a review update!", "date": "2013-05-22 22:09:18"}

Everything from falafels to pulled pork sandwiches, Asian cuisine, just everything.  \n\nTermini Bros has a shop in here, don't pass on the canolis, they are renowned for their pastries.\n\nI would not recommend Down Home Diner - they have a dining time limit.

If you're a foodie, you'll love it here. Just beware, the crowds can get pretty intense, especially on the weekends and especially around lunch.\n\nSo the market is kind of half actual market where you can buy meat, seafood, cheese, produce, canned and packaged goods, etc., and take it home, and then the rest of the stands in the market are all kinds of varieties of lunch counters, basically. There's sushi. There's Greek. There's Thai. There's cheesesteaks (well, duh... but if you really want a great steak, go to Pat's in South Philly or at least Jim's on South Street). Some places actually have counters where you can sit. Otherwise, there are communal seating areas with tables and such for people who want to sit and eat. It's a great place to taste and explore but bring some patience and a kind attitude with you.\n\nTwo cautions:\n1. Many of the lunch places especially are cash only. There is an ATM in the building but you'd be better off to come packing with some cash.\n2. The parking rates around the market are atrocious and the parking meter people are Nazis. If you are lucky enough to snag a street spot, make SURE you are parked in a spot that is for cars (some are for motorcycles only) and that you note how much time you have. Some of the spots are really tricky and are only like 15 minute spaces. You can also try nearby Chinatown -- it's only about a three block walk -- but parking there can be dicey, too. If you cannot find street parking, there are two nearby decks that have a deal with the market. Park in the deck, spend $10+ with a market merchant, have them validate your receipt, and your parking will only be $4. 2 hour limit, but that's plenty of time to get in, look around and get out.

Go for a nice bubble tea or authentic Szechuan cuisine just one block down! Plus, Dim Sum Garden always has amazing food! The Gallery is right by the market, too; so if you're not in the mood for Chinese Food, maybe you're in the mood to do some shopping. \n\nI'm not rating it 5 stars for two reasons: Reading Terminal Market is great, but unfortunately, being in the center of the city, it is a bit small. I hope one day, the Market will go through an underground renovation and add a basement! Also, I wish there were an easy exit/entrance by 11th street.

I think I will let these adjectives do the talking: moist, juicy, succulent, flavorful, hearty, lip smacking & finger licking good. I think that sums it up.

They have spice shops, bookstores, honey shops and souvenir shops.\n\nI personally really liked the Amish breakfast spot with the sandwiches. My husband had the pork roll sandwich and really enjoyed it. I also loved the red velvet whoopie pie from the Flying Fish bakery. We ate lunch here and got the philly cheese steaks at Carmen's. I could have eaten at a lot of the other shops too though!\n\nThis is a really fun place to walk around and try a variety of Philly foods.

One of my friends suggested Reading terminal and based on what I've heard about the variety, it was the perfect pick,\n\nWe did a lap of the building before anyone purchased a thing. I wish I took notes to make my next trip easier. Things that stood out included the sushi, DiNic's, a stand with bacon, a fresh fish stand, a juice/smoothie place and the list goes on. \n\nWe were able to grab a table with 5 seats and took turns getting our lunch. I love the variety at the table- sesame chicken, a turkey sand which, char grilled eggplant sandwich and a falafel. Since I was fresh off brunch, I decided to just have some ice cream. I was intrigued by the abundance of Amish vendors so picked Miller's Twist. After sample a few flavors, I decided on a small cup of banana ice cream. Perfect!

It really is the largest and most unique market I've ever seen! If only supermarkets would go away and be replaced by thousands of Reading Terminal Markets (although it would lose a little bit of its appeal.)\n\nMy favorite spots were Famous 4th Street Cookie Company, Beiler's Bakery, Dutch Eating Place, Sweet as Fudge Candy Shoppe, Lancaster County Dairy, Bee Natural, 12th Street Cantina, Dienner's Bar-B-Q, and Kamal's Middle Eastern Specialities.\n\nThe Amish merchants are without a doubt some of the best foods I have ever eaten and what makes the market so special. I ended up buying 2 pounds of various chocolate fudges from Sweet as Fudge, 2 dozen doughnuts from Beiler's, an open faced turkey sandwich from Dutch Eating Place, a Strawberry Orange Lemonade from Lancaster County Dairy, and 3 chocolate chip cookies from Famous 4th Street Cookie Company. \n\nIf you are driving in, make sure to get your parking validated when you spend at least $10 and can park in the garage on Filbert Street for just $4 up to 2 hours. You won't find a better deal for parking anywhere else in the city. When you don't have anything else planned, you can easily spend an entire day here and you'll love every minute of it!", "date": "2013-07-31 16:27:53"}

They have a great selection of great meant vendors specializing in the off beaten track fares, as well as the good old fashion sources of protein. All fresh, tasty, and at a fair price.\n\nThen the restaurants inside Reading Terminal is actually really good.

That's what we say in Philly, right?\n\nI ain't gonna lie to you, kid. I usually only come here when people are in town visiting because it's made for indecisive people like me! Sure I want to take my out of towners to my favy restaurants, but at the same time I'm like \"well hmmm, this person only eats vegetarian, and this chick has a gluten allergy, and this assh%le only eats steak...\" etc etc so it can be like a nightmare coming up with a place where we can all be happy. Hence Reading Terminal where I don't have to dictate anything, I can just point you to what you're craving and we can all meet up by the tables by the piano (real, not electric today!). Great! \n\nThe festive thing about this place is that it's not just food. They've got flowers, they've got cookbooks, they've got jewelry, they've got kitchen gadgets... So it's a great place to wander around too, which is perfect when you're sick of taking everybody to see the bell for the 100th time. And hey, I needed olive oil and a bag of green beans... and viola! I can grab those things here too. So wonderfully efficient, one stop shopping like Target but like, less evil. I think. \n\nThe only uncomfortable thing which also makes me laugh dorkily to myself is the waiting-for-the-tables nightmare. When it's crowded and you've hit like everybody with your ginormous roast pork sandwich trying to hustle to find a table you then have to STALK the various areas and watch people eat, counting how many minutes it'll take them to finish based on their current consumption rate/conversation. I like to find the quiet people. They leave faster. But it's so awkward swooping down and crowding them when they're just trying to relax and enjoy their Amish food. But it's gotta be done. No way around you feeling my beady-eyed stare at the back of your head as you try to finish your fried mac and cheese ball. Sigh.\n\nDo it. Come here.

I didn't know exactly what this place was until I actually ventured here on a Friday after sightseeing in the historical district. The Reading Terminal Market is basically a larger than life indoor Farmer's Market that mingles like a Chinatown as well. There's plenty of vendors and food choices that will make your head spin. I probably spent a good hour here and buying a few things before heading back to the hotel on Walnut Street.  Pretty much anything and everything food wise you can get is here. \n\nLocated on 12th Street, the Reading Terminal Market  is centrally located in downtown Philadelphia. Many bus routes converge here and it's very walkable from all points in downtown. It's quite busy here and it  tends to be loaded with a lot of people surfing for good deals on anything and everything. It reminds me of a indoor Chinatown in a way, where all the vendors line up tightly and it's more or less a mom and pop operation for each vendor that's represented. Good deals can be had here and I took advantage of it.\n\nPrices here can be wholesale and retail at the same time, depending on what you are looking for. There is even a shoe shinning operation at the back of the market. I'm not sure why tripadvisor told me that this is really a must do, but it wasn't as good of a visit that I thought it would be.

Here's my quick guide on the highlights of where to eat: \n\nBreakfast\nBeiler's donuts - Ranked by Fodor's as America's 20 best desserts spots. They do donuts well. Apple fritter and Dutch crumb are my favs. \nBeiler's bakery - You'll need to share the blueberry loaf of bread. Honorable mention for the sticky bun, but it's not served warm.\nMetropolitan bakery - They do typical baked goods well. I love the almond croissant and various muffins. \nDutch Eating Place - Breakfast done well. Love the pancakes.\n\nLunch\nLittle Thai Market - Their grilled salmon dish (comes with rice and broccoli) is good and affordable ($7 and some change). You can get extra curry sauce and/or shrimp if you pay a little extra. This dish is popular with the locals and you can see a line at lunch time. If there's a long line, I would skip unless you really want to eat seafood.\n\nSandwiches\nHatville Deli - Corned beef special\nDinic's - Featured on Man vs. Food. Get the roast pork, get it with provolone.\nHerschel's Deli - Pastrami sandwich preferably reuben. The corned beef is also good. \nThe Original Turkey - thick slices of turkey, cooked perfectly.\n\nSnack -\nMiller's Twist - The pretzels are way better than Auntie Annie's. \nIovine Brothers Produce - eat healthy and get some fruits or nuts for the road.\n\nDessert\n4th Street Cookie Company - My favorite is the chocolate chip with walnut\nBasset's Ice Cream\nTermini Brothers - Get the cannoli \nBeck's Cajun Cafe - The beignets are amazing, but only served on certain days.\nBeiler's Bakery - The shoofly pie and whoopie pie are good and very unique to this culture.\nDutch Eating Place - Hot apple dumpling, the PA Dutch version of an apple pie.\nFlying monkey - Get your dessert fix here if you're vegan.\n\nBeverages\nOld City Coffee - This hits the spot after all the food you've eaten. Goes great with dessert.", "date": "2014-02-06 01:25:24"}

Sadly, markets are becoming more and more rare, as people tend to do more shopping at megastores and eat crappy prepared food in food courts or strip malls.\n\nThis market has an excellent array of food stalls, pantry items, and fresh produce. In my opinion, the best establishments in the market are Iovine's produce market, The Head Nut (which has bulk food, spices, coffee, etc), John Yi Fish Market, and Beiler's Hand Rolled Doughnuts. These business are exceptional and some of the best of their kind in the city.\n\nIn addition to those listed above, there's a smattering of other very good food stalls. Some places are definitely overpriced, and others are just not very good at all.\n\nBut, there's something for every taste here, and it is definitely an experience to go. If you're only in Philadelphia for a day, it's worth it to go to Reading Terminal Market so you can have the experience once. \n\nI am lucky enough to live just under a 20 minute walk away, so I try to make a trip once every 10-14 days to stock up on certain food items for my pantry/kitchen since it has some of the best produce (at Iovine's) and fish (at John Yi's) in particular.\n\nSure, it's not like some of the bigger and better markets if you compare it to other cities in the world.

I usually visit the shops with homemade candles, natural health & beauty products, and African cultural items/accessories.  There is definitely something for everyone at Reading Terminal!\n\nGood luck finding anywhere to sit in the main dining area, during lunch.  Also, parking down there throughout the day can be a major headache.  I'd suggest public transit or taxi service.", "date": "2014-03-06 17:16:32"}

I love coming on the weekends for lunch and having my choice of gyros, roast pork, breakfast sandwiches, and some of the most delightful donuts in this city.  It is true that on the weekends the crowds can be crazy and it can be hard to walk through the aisles and browse, but if you know where you're going you can go in one of the exterior doors nearest your destination and cut out some of the hassle.  \n\nOlympic Gyro makes awesome gyros (go for the platter and you get a heaping Greek salad on the side!), Beiler's Donuts are cream-filled gluttony (the banana is an old standard, and don't miss the banana ice cream at Bassett's-best banana ice cream EVER).  DiNic's is a classic and draws huge crowds of tourists and locals alike but I tend to skip the lines in favor of Olympic because you can pretty much always get a seat right away. \n\n Also the Amish diner counter slings breakfast foods insanely fast- you've barely finished ordering and they already are putting plates down in front of you!  Very standard fare but worth it in a time crunch.\n\nAlso The Tubby Olive, a little shop that sells flavored olive oils and vinegars, is a great place to get a hostess/mom gift and they have tons of different styles and flavors that you can try in the shop.  A little pricey for olive oil and vinegar but a fun gift idea for someone who likes to cook/make salads.  \n\nAlso Reading Terminal Market is super conveniently located in Center City so it's perfect in the middle of a day on the town.  Watch out on Sundays though because many of the Amish shops are closed and you can't have any donuts :(.", "date": "2014-03-07 00:09:02"}

Reading Terminal Market is unlike any food/shopping experience you have had in the past. With almost 100 different vendors, it is the perfect spot to grab lunch, or a very early dinner (it closes around 6) with those picky eaters you might be friends with. The market also has a great history surrounding it- it opened in 1892 and occupies the Reading Railroad's basement. You know the Monopoly Railroad card you always fought over? Now you can take part of the action in real life.\n\nThe market has an eclectic array of restaurants serving up dishes like roasted pork sandwiches, crepes, sushi, Mexican, traditional Amish chicken/donuts/breakfast, peking duck, ice cream, cookies, cakes and homemade candies. You can also find vendors that sell Italian sausage, fish, fresh meats, produce and so much more. It is the one stop shop for lunch, dinner and dessert.\n\nSome suggestions:\nIf you want a traditional Philly style \"hoagie\" (what we call sandwiches), that tops the traditional Philly cheesesteak, head over to Dinic's. They feature a roasted pork sandwich with provolone, sweet/hot peppers and broccoli rabe. Messy and drool worthy all at once.\nMartin's Quality Meat and Sausage has great pork sausages, chicken sausages, and Italian sausage. This place is a perfect spot to pick up tonight's Italian dinner. You will impress everyone around you, not only with your cooking skills but with your ability to decide on which type of sausage you want. This place seriously has everything....\nIf you have a sweet tooth, definitely hit up Basset's Ice Cream- every single flavor you could imagine in cones and cups, dishes and sundaes, milkshakes and packed pints. A great family establishment with tasty ice cream to boot.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Reading Terminal (unless you decide NOT to get anything, and then that is just sacrilegious and an insult to Philly), just make sure you bring cash for CASH only hot spots and try not to become too overwhelmed. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us; being indecisive is a gift.", "date": "2014-03-19 16:48:46"}

I went for the famous roast pork sandwich I'd seen on man vs food - and what a sandwich it was.  I think the three in front and behind me had ordered the exact same thing - roast pork, provolone, rabe.  It was amazing.  Loved every bite, the moist bread, the cheese.  Delicious.\n\nI also had my first whoopie pie from flying monkeys - again delicious!  \n\nI then spent the afternoon shopping on walnut and chestnut and everywhere in between - before heading back to my hotel I dropped by the market again to pick up soon for dinner.  It was about 5.30 and most places were closed by this time.  I managed to grab the last boneless rib sandwich from The Rib Stop - I'm glad I did as it was also delicious, the awesome dry rub rib taste letting the meat be the hero rather than the sauce.  Just simply delicious.\n\nI think you could go here for lunch and dinner in a month - eating somewhere different each time - and never visit the same place.  Really fantastic - need to figure out how to work another trip here into the rest if my vacation!!", "date": "2014-03-28 23:43:29"}

The line was pretty much wrapped around the place. \n\nVerdict? It was pretty awesome. Not as what I expected or hoped for, but it was still pretty damn good. For some reason or another the roast beef was much more juicy and flavorful than the famous pork. But hey, why not get them both and try for yourselves. \n\nReading Terminal market is basically where both the locals and tourists go. Chocolate dipped bacon, chocolate dipped pretzel with bacon, a great donut shop which offers a variety of donuts including maple bacon, triple chocolate, coconut cream, mocha cream, etc...\n\nYou can probably spend a good 2 hours here before your clothes stink like seafood, fried batter and cheesesteaks. \n\nReally enjoyed the visit.

My gf and I were staying across the street at the Marriott and if we were staying in philly for more than a day we would have gone to reading terminal market every day. It's that good. We walked in at around 1pm on a saturday afternoon to scope out our dinner options since we just had lunch. We wanted to try Tommy DiNic's cause of all the hype over their roast pork sandwich and brisket, but the line was long so we figured we would come back closer to dinner time. This was a BIG MISTAKE.. and i'll tell you why in a second. When we came back at 4:30pm they were sold out... of everything. yep everything and the market closes at 6 on a saturday. We were both disappointed so we settled for Beiler's Donuts, Bassetts Ice Cream, and Miller's Twist Pretzels to comfort us. Beiler's donuts did the trick. We got the maple bacon, banana creme, harvest apple 2x, pumpkin, and blueberry fritter. They were all delicious, fresh, and omg i'm dreaming of those donuts as I'm writing this review. My favorite was definitely the maple bacon. The donuts are cheap for what they are $5.25 for half a dozen. Bassetts was also good, their ice cream is very creamy. I had green tea and cookies and cream, but the ice cream here is pricey. Miller's twist was the last thing we tried and they make their pretzels really well, not overly salted and reasonably priced ($2.25 for a regular pretzel.) So glad I don't live near Beiler's cause I would get fatttttttt.", "date": "2014-04-18 14:26:49"}

It will most likely be repetitive of other reviews for it, but oh well. \n\nFirst, we waited until Sunday to go, which I now wish we wouldn't have done since some of the PA Dutch vendors were closed. It was a rainy morning though, so venturing to the Reading Terminal Market was a timely idea since it is all inside. \n\nIt was sort of like an indoor farmer's market, much like the sheltered waterfront market in Seattle. Different vendors selling all kinds of food items, many having a dine-in option, or at least counter service. You truly should come hungry. There are lots of items to choose from to sample, and buy to take with you. We actually came in the morning, and grabbed enough fruit, peanuts, and cheese that we just ate what we bought as we walked around all day so it was a really great option. We also bought some jams, cheese, and vegetables to take home with us. \n\nThe only negative (but not worth a reduction of stars), because of it's location, there are some homeless people and scammers who know that tourists are there and ready to pounce on so there is that. We did have a few homeless people ask us for money, and another guy who tried to tell us that he had a kidney transplant and needed money to get back home, but we didn't let that damper our experience. We've been taken by this kind of things many times in the past. It has sort of become standard of our experiences nowadays.", "date": "2014-05-12 11:56:09"}

If you don't consider yourself a foodie, I garuntee you will be after your first few minutes walking through this place. To simply put it, the Reading Terminal Market is heaven. I'm surpised they don't have a Golden gate and angels at the entrance. There is every kind of cusine you can think of and it is all authentic and as fresh as can be. A few of the restaurants in there have been featured on food network tv shows. And many of the places are Zagat rated. For you sweets lovers, they have a whole aisle of just that and if you don't see what you're looking for on display, there's a few places that can make any dessert/ cake you body/ mind desires. This place is so amazing, I can't even say what my favorite restaurant is. There's just waaaay too many! To add to that, they also have amazing coffee, book stores, a nut stand, Amish stand, ice cream stands, cookie stands, an oyester bar, exotic grill chees stand, bee wax product stand, fresh bread stands, a few vegetable and seafood stands with unbeatable prices and products, just to name a few. They occasionally events/ shows around the food court which makes it almost too much to handle. Annnd difficult to navigate. Speaking of navigating, that's my only complaint about this place. It gets super, ridiculously, unbelievably crowded on the weekends. But that's only because it's clearly one of the best things that Philly has to offer.

I'd say the majority of the shops are food stalls designed for you to order something and eat there (sandwiches, bakeries, etc.) but there's also quite a number of seafood, meat, poultry, and produce places.  Overall, I found the prices of the seafood to be comparable to my local grocery store (but sooo much fresher looking), and the prices of the meat/poultry to be about on par with grocery store prices, if not just a tad more expensive.  If you look closely, you can even find some deals (like ground lamb for $4.95/lb?! I usually pay $7.99-$8.99!)\n\nCome early, avoid weekends if possible, and try to avoid being in the background shots of as many tourists' photos as possible :)", "date": "2014-06-28 14:27:22"}

The market has a little bit but I have changed a lot more.\n\nIn that time I have converted to a vegan diet. The market has some new stalls but its overall vibe (meat and fish heavy unhealthy Philly fare) has not. \n\nI still enjoy a stroll through the market (so long as my gaze avoids the meat and seafood stalls) but those walks are just nostalgia for my first years in Philadelphia when my wife and I were first dating. Way back then (the ancient era of 2004-2005) she and I would go to the market for a the special at the Hatfield Farms deli counter. Back then whenever I had time to kill, I would do it at Reading Terminal Market.\n\nAs my tastes have changed the Market has barely budged. It feels stuck in a past where people ate like they did not give a damn. Maybe I'm being too hard here. It could just be my age. I loved the market in my 20s. In my 30s, I usually only order something from the Four Seasons veggie juice bar. \n\nI recently sat at a table at the Market to grade some student work before I met up with some friends. As I was sitting with my Four Seasons juice I was asked to take part in a survey by a woman researching for Reading Terminal Market. My overall feedback to her: \"this could be such a great place and I would recommend it to friends if only it had some vegan take-out!\"\n\nTo be fair: Reading Terminal Market has the vegan cupcake at Flying Monkey (quite good) and Molly Malloy's which is not a bad place to hang out. And of course Four Seasons for some really good cheap veggie juice.\n\nAside from that and coffee I don't spend money there. Its managers should take a walk on South Street and enjoy some of its vegan take-out. Imagine what Reading Terminal Market could be if it included some of that!", "date": "2014-07-07 14:22:27"}

RTM features a dizzying selection of specialty foods, ethnic foods, and wonderful eats - from sweet to savory - to satisfy any appetite. It's a foodies wet dream. \n\nMost people have heard of RTM and check them about because of the fanfare that Dinic's Roast Pork sandwich has received from the Travel Channel. I might take some heat for this - the sandwich is really good but a bit overrated IMO - but you do yourself a disservice if you have the opportunity to try one and don't. But you also do yourself a disservice if you go to RTM, eat at DiNic's, and don't explore or try anything else. \n\nThe wife and I took the complimentary ride from our hotel to RTM, arrived at about 10:30AM, and spent about 90 minutes or so there. We started at Old City Coffee before heading over to DiNic's, and we also tried Miller's Twist (my favorite) and Flying Monkey Bakery (Whoopie Pies FTW!) We explored The Head Nut (insert joke here) and my wife enjoyed reliving her childhood while exploring Wursthaus Schmitz.\n\nA few tips for the RTM n00b:\n\n1. Read the review of my new Yelp Elite friend and Philly local Steven B. He covers many of the basics. Definitely make sure you go on a day where the Amish vendors are open!\n\n2. If your mission is to try the famed Dinic's Roast Pork, plan strategically. The wife and I were in Philly Friday and Saturday, and we decided to come early Friday morning, guessing that would be the least crowded. We were right. We got to DiNic's about 10:45AM or so, and were lucky to get two seats that hat just opened up. \n\n3. The place gets crowded FAST. Be prepared for crowds. It wasn't crowded at all when we arrived, but by lunch time the market was packed with local workers on lunch break.\n\n4. Plan ahead if you are a tourist and you want to purchase items to take out with you. This was our mistake. I planned to explore the market, but DiNic's was my main mission, so we came early and planned to go do the touristy stuff (Independence Hall, etc.) after. Unfortunately, this did not allow us to buy any product except what we stuffed in our bellies. Next time we visit Philly, we are considering staying at a nearby hotel to alleviate this issue.\n\nAnyone who loves food and dares to call themselves a \"foodie\" will love this place. If you don't love Reading Terminal Market, you have no soul.", "date": "2014-07-23 21:55:36"}

I can talk about the cluster , or a gathering of cultures under one roof that will overwhelm you. I can talk about the endless options of food to satisfy anyones cravings. I can mention also that there is a minature supermarket located inside.  I really don't know what else there is to mention other than this is a foodies paradise.  \n\nReading Terminal is by far the best option for anyone who wants a taste of everything , from the simple to the exotic. I know I just used the word exotic , but its true, when you step inside its like a whole different world. You don't know where to go to first pretty much, they have everything you could possibly imagine. \n\nA combination of cultures ready to hit you with an endless amounts of delights. If it isn't the Amish with their sinful donuts, pastries, cakes and pies, its their BBQ pit. Forget what you saw on TV about the Amish Mafia ,(If anyone ever saw it) these guys set up a \"Front\" in Reading where there is a line as  wrapping around the corner. All just to try their product, which by the way is on point. I do reccommend you go during the end of the week, these guys aren't set up on the weekends.(Sundays and Mondays)   I am still baffled by this.... the Amish, who knew they could attract so much attention. \n\n A little side note~ To the Amish, I am now a loyal patron to your pastries, you made an offer I couldn't refuse.\n\nWhere else can you go for shopping, tasting, exploring, eating, all under one roof in the city. I am sure there is 1 or 2 spots, maybe , but do they have a bar inside? Yea I said it a bar, you can break away from the shuffling of on goers. All  trying to get that last slice of cheese or get that  fresh baked French bread. Slide on in at Mollys and take a breather, enjoy a few libations, recharge the system for rounds 2 or 3 maybe 4. I mean they do also have coffee stations along the way if you need a little pick me up , even they get blown out .  \n\nReading Terminal is pretty much the United Nations of cultures with American to European, to Asian, even Middle Eastern cultures trying to win you over.  This gives you  another reason why for you to return, endless options that can't be conquered in one day. \n\n Plus they have cook books, a library basically of food preparations for every ethnic backgrounds  available. Reading even has a GINORMOUS section where you can buy key ingredients in spices and herbs,  where it would not be easy to find anywhere else.     \n\nI am still trying here people to figure what to tell you that hasn't been said, so if I sound like I am repeating its not my fault.  I will tell you this though, the city did try to shut this spot down. In the mid to late '90s the city of Philadelphia came close to putting an end to Reading Terminal. I guess the power and the voice of the people pretty much told the city who their daddy was.  \n\nPretty much if I were to try to sum it up  Reading Terminal is a MUST. You'll definitely leave either with a full belly, or bags of goodies to peruse later. Now get in there and get a chocolate dipped onion to munch on as you enjoy the festivities of Reading Terminal.", "date": "2014-08-01 20:02:08"}

The Thai place has a salmon dish that is amazing and every stand there has a speciality, just ask the people in line for which items are the stand's signature dish(es).", "date": "2014-08-20 16:14:59"}

Before I start I should mention that I'm only a customer of Little Basil restaurant and I don't know anyone personally in that restaurant.\nI've read Brad A.'s  unfair comment about the little basil restaurant and I didn't appreciate the way he talked about the employees /owner of this restaurant.I have been buying food from this restaurant for over 30 years and yet, I've never had or heard any complains about the food or especially of the employees. To my understanding Brad was looking to get something for free.First of all according to him,the ad (If there was one) says if you purchase $20 or more you'll get something for free. Well, he spent $19.58 and that's not $20 .Also, he says that he does not believe they're losing a customer over 47 cents. My question for Brad is , apparently he likes the food that he orders it from there,then why he's losing his relationship with them over 47 Cents. Also, he laid about the owner telling him that it was a new deal. She never said such thing to him. To my understanding this thing has been going on for quite a while and he manages to get free things by threatening to cancel his order if they don't give him something for free. Since they wanted to keep him as a \"customer\" happy, they gave him something for free. Unfortunately, Brad got greedy and kept asking for more freebies. Brad ,you should be ashamed of yourself to bother these hard working people who work at lease 14 hours a day to serve people like you and I .You don't like their food /customer service then I suggest you find someone else to put up with your non sense.Have some dignity and be a man and leave them alone and don't ruin their reputations for your cheapness and selfishness.

Would be great to have a place like this next door!    \n\n    Helpful hint at one door on Race Street they have a holder of maps. GET ONE. I had some coupons for some of the businesses and it was hard to find them!  Its crowded and you have a hard time seeing signs through the crowds. That map was certainly helpful.  I'll post a pic of the map too!\n\n    I cant give the place 5 stars though because of one major drawback. Crowds.  They need more space. I don't know whats upstairs but someone sometime back should have found a way to make another floor up there. They have maybe 100? 150? seats in central areas but those are only a small fraction of the demand. If you go with a family or group and you want to sit and eat together you have to go off hour or you can forget that idea!  Mid day Sat is a madhouse.  Individual vendors often have seats at their counters too but often just 5,6 or 7 chairs. Again if theres many of you you can forget that!\n\n   Prices are not low either, but you can hunt for bargains. You will find some marking down items in the last hour or two. Especially bakeries that bag it all for a flat price, and put it on top of the counter. They want the counter bare when they go home.\n\n   The actual fruit and vegetable vendors left are only a few, so not much there or major interest.  Lots of sweets, candy, honey, meats, cold cuts, sandwiches, turkey, ice cream etc. \n  \n    Bassetts is the oldest ice cream in the USA. I had a coupon there but no way was I going to try and carry it and eat with such a crowd.\n\n     Its fun though to walk through and maybe grab a few things to go and then find yourself a place where you can sit and enjoy it later.", "date": "2014-11-22 18:59:03"}

Although there is a public market in PGH, where I live now, it pales in comparison to RTM--a more appropriate comparison would be to the entire neighborhood that the public market is located in (the Strip District).  What I'd like to know is, how does Philly manage to fit most of the offerings of the Strip into one building?!?\n\nAnyway, I wanted to make the most of my first visit to RTM, so I did my research, and hit the following places for the following goods, all of which cost me about $25:\n\nDiNic's: Roast pork sandwich w/ sharp provolone and broccoli rabe\nMiller's Twist: Pretzel w/ honey mustard sauce\nLancaster County Dairy: Orange strawberry lemonade\nBassett's Ice Cream: Peanut butter swirl sugar cone\nBeiler's Bakery: Half dozen donuts\n\nBecause I came here directly off the train from Pittsburgh, which was running late and hadn't made the usual stop in Harrisburg for lunch, all I'd eaten all day was a bagel at 7am and an apple at 1pm.  So, needless to say, when I arrived here around 3:30pm, I was ravenously hungry, and ate everything listed above with the exception of the donuts, which I brought home for my family.  I was surprised at how many vendors were open when I visited, but one of them explained that they were open later than usual due to the proximity to Thanksgiving.  How lucky for me, since I wasn't expecting to be able to patronize Miller's or Beiler's, given that they're not usually open at this time!\n\nI'll leave the details of each foodstuff I tried to reviews of the individual vendors (forthcoming), but suffice it to say that everything, with one exception, was supremely delicious!  I left RTM stuffed and happy--a good thing, since I had an hour-long ride on SEPTA to DE to look forward to.  I walked out of there wondering why I'd never been to RTM before, and thinking that I need to get back here ASAP to sample more of the offerings.  In fact, I'm planning to talk the fam into taking me back here for brunch at Dutch Eating Place on Sat. before my train back to PGH leaves on Sat.\n\nLong story short, this place is awesome!!!  If you're a visitor to Philly, you need to see this place before you leave.

The pastrami was cut and served right in front of ur eyes and it was juicy and delicious!!!! \n\nAnd if u have a sweet tooth. They have a chocolate spot and a homemade donut shop.  They make the donuts right there. And wow are they to die for.  My favorite donut was the salted caramel and blueberry fritter.   But there were many more flavors to choose from.  \n\nThey also have a produce section and also a fresh seafood and butcher as well.

When I arrived and stepped inside, I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\nI was instantly transported from a dreary cold and rainy day to a vibrant market full of shops and people milling about. I entered by the fresh produce and thought, \"it's like a farmers market\". Wrong. This place is a little bit of everything. Farmers Market. Grocery Store. Restaurant. Fish Market. Bookstore. Winery. Lancaster County Amish goods. Cakes. Pies. It's a you-name-it, they have it kind of place.\n\nAll of the shops are fairly small but packed. For those of you in Indy, imagine City Market sized businesses, but picture 150-175 of them on a single floor about three times the Indy City Market. Picture lines of people 30 people deep waiting for hand rolled donuts from Beiler's Bakery. Picture small restaurants with seating for only 10 or so people turning out every type of food you can imagine from all over the country. Picture me walking around trying to absorb every piece of this that I could, all the while wondering why Indianapolis doesn't have something so amazingly awesome. \n\nPhilly, you've won my heart and you've won my stomach.

I only go to Smucker's now for meat and bacon (sometimes I cheat on them with Kensington Quarters now). The bacon prices are the same or cheaper than the supermarket and the quality of what you are getting is miles better. For seafood there is no better place than John Yi's seafood, they consistently have the best and freshest selection of seafood and everyone who works there is super friendly and helpful.

Make sure you bring your appetite and allow yourself plenty of time to wander through the enormous food bazaar. \n\nI ate at the 'DUTCH EATING PLACE' on my last visit.  I truly enjoyed their homestyle cooking. Everyone raves over their apple dumpling and breakfast fare. They can be found in the \"Amish Corner\" of the market and they're their perfect spot to sample classic Pennsylvania Dutch deliciousness. Again, there are plenty of options to choose from and you defiantly won't leave here empty handed or hungry.  \n\nFinal Verdict: This is a MUST VISIT if you're visiting Philadelphia.", "date": "2015-01-19 00:46:28"}

I have always heard great things about this place and now I can finally attest to all the amazing reviews! \n\nA little about the experience:  First, the place itself; walking in is a treat within itself and so easy with all the entrances that are available. The air is filled with aromas from all different foods and cultures that just seem to blend so perfectly well together. The bustling from all the locals and out-of-town\"ers\" makes you feel like a true city folk. All the vendors are nice and knowledgeable of the area; which sure helps a first timer like myself when trying to navigate the market innards. However this wouldn't be needed if a directory was put up somewhere which was my only complaint about the whole place. My first thought was oh this place is going to have a couple of little places to eat inside, to my delightful surprise it also contained fresh looking meat markets and fresh vegetable stands located inside, it was quite a treat to see. In addition to all the food YOU CAN EVER WANT they also offer little stores filled with knick-knacks so you can leave with two types of souvenirs one to eat and a one to keep. Not to mention if you ever seem to be a little short on cash no worries you can find ATM's scattered throughout.\n\nNow a yelp-ers favorite part of the review: the food. I personally went to Herchel's, Dinics and the famous Beiler's Bakery. Lucky for me when I first entered, the bakery was staring me right in the eye holes tempting all my taste buds with their aesthetically pleasing cakes, muffins, pastries of all sorts and the ever so tantalizing Beiler's Doughnuts which I had to part-take in. Unfortunately by the time I had gotten there all the Boston Creme doughnuts (which happen to be my favorite doughnut were all out (sad face)). So I went in without a plan and was not totally disappointed. I went with a Red Velvet doughnut which to my pleasure was quite the pallet pleaser, it had the red velvet taste down to a \"t\", Other doughnuts included a Salted Caramel apple, Gingersnap and \"The Elvis\".\n\nDinic's is located more towards the middle of the Terminal market taking up quite a bit more real estate than others. They offered delectable sandwich choices and the staff was pleasant and knowledgeable of their product. \n\nI knew I couldn't leave without trying Hershel's deli.The menu looked delicious so I couldn't say no to grabbing one of their scrumptious sandwiches. So i then found myself standing in line. They offer your run of the mill delicatessen sandwiches, however I wouldn't be wrong to say that they do them a little better than most, in my honest opinion. \n\nAll-in-all this place is must-go if you ever find yourself in the City of Philadelphia; with its wide variety of stores and fresh produce as well as meats, you can't go wrong with a trip to Reading terminal market!! To quote the famous actor and Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger \"I'll be back\".", "date": "2015-01-20 01:12:17"}

I lived in Philly for a year and Reading Terminal market was easily my favorite place to be. In fact, I may go as far as to say that it is my favorite place... PERIOD. Obviously there is a nostalgia factor, however, this place lives up to the hype. \nReading Terminal is situated right in the heart of center city and is located above what is now the Jefferson Station (used to be Market St Station). The market has various vendors where you can buy your high quality meat, cheese, fish, and produce. Not to mention Ivarone brothers, which has the most affordable high quality produce that I've ever encountered living on the east coast. Reading terminal also has vendors selling cuisines from all over the world. These are your must go places: Amish market area, Tommy Dinic's (roast pork sandwich), Ivarone Brothers, and Hope's cookies. The Amish area is only open I believe Wed. or Thurs. through Saturday. They have an Amish diner which is incredible (check out the baked apples). They also sell hot dogs wrapped in crispy homemade pretzels and cheese which are to die for. The Amish bakery must also not be missed and you honestly can't go wrong with pie by the slice or any of the various other traditional baked confections they offer. Tommy Dinic's is a must too. Adam Richman (Host of Man v. Food on Travel Channel) coined their Roast Pork Sandwich the best sandwich in the country. Lastly, you CAN'T miss Hope's cookies. They also sell fudge, but you need to get those cookies. Everyone heads to 4th St Cookie Co (also in Reading Terminal), which has great cookies, but nothing compared to Hope's! They have unique gooey flavors like Heath Bar, caramel pecan, and my personal favorite, Wilbur's peanut butter (PB cup chunks and chocolate chunks). \nWhenever you or anyone you know ever enters the city of Philadelphia, you must forget what your doing for a good hour and head to Reading Terminal Market!", "date": "2015-01-29 19:40:50"}

There's more than one (or two or three) incredible bakeries, multiple seafood vendors, a couple of butchers, a poulterer, three produce/grocery meccas (well, one mecca and two side chapels). The quality of food at all of them is terrific, and the prices are reasonable considering the quality. There's a honey place, a tea store and an herb vendor. Pennsylvania Dutch farmer's sell homemade pies, donuts, sandwiches, meats, cheese, etc. I get my Thanksgiving feast food here -- the poulterer is tremendous.\n\nAnd the restaurants! Coffee, donuts, ice cream, several vendors for delectable cold cuts and spreads, sandwich places up the yahoo, two Asian places, one German, one Greek, a creperie, and more. There's a large community eating section in the middle of the Market and individual vendors have seating as well. Restrooms are available that are clean and well maintained.\n\nNon-food vendors include a cookbook niche and a Philly-themed gift shop.\n\nRTM appeared in the movie Trading Places, and it dresses up for the holidays with a huge miniature train set up, which is appropriate since this building is the former Reading RR (as in Monopoly) train shed.\n\nThe Market is open seven days a week but the Pennsylvania Dutch vendors are not there on Sundays or Mondays (and maybe Tuesdays?).\n\nOn 12th Street between Arch and Filbert, this fascinating indoor public market is near the convention center, not far from City Hall, and on Chinatown's doorstep, convenient to Market St. and many bus routes, and very close to the Chinatown bus depot.\n\nFounded in 1892, it's a great place to bring visitors. Go there for the history, then stay for lunch! It's not nearly as crowded in the mornings before 11 and in late afternoon, even on weekends. Other times it is crushingly crowded with lines everywhere. Still worthwhile, but not as pleasant! The vendors are almost universally cheery and helpful.\n\nThere are multiple entrances.

This place is a must for breakfast.\n\nOne place I do not recommend is tommy dinic's. This place makes me angry cause I waited in line for so long just to get a low quality sandwich. I was expecting their sandwich to be delicious because of all the hype. I was a bit confused as to why people were so excited about this place. I really was so confused and I am still confused by it. I also feel like I will forever be confused as to why people are so infatuated by this place. It's really not worth the wait nor is the hype real. They don't have a huge depth of flavor profiles in their sandwich. I give dinic's two stars. But their service is quick and very friendly. \n\nOverall, this market is a must when in the city.

There are flower shops, bakeries, grocery stalls, food stalls, drinks, and other knick knacks. I actually came here to meet up with some old high-school friends and it was the perfect spot. We came here around 3:00pm on a Friday afternoon; I saw high school students, college students, couples, kids and parents...this place is great for everyone! My friends and I were able to walk around and enjoy the different stores, get a drink, buy food,  sit down and eat, shop, etc. Reading Market is definitely a nice tourist spot and there are some very interesting things to see...and taste! For example, there is one stall that sells chocolate-covered onions. Not that its my sort of taste, but it isn't something you see everyday at your typical supermarket.\n\nI'm sure there are a lot of people during noon time and dinner time, but it was not very crowded when I went during mid-afternoon.

They have great groceries, amazing desserts, and random little stalls that offer everything from earrings to honey chapstick. I'll break this down more\n\nGroceries: I go to reading terminal for groceries as much as I can. I've been able to find everything, and for cheaper/fresher, except for milk and pasta. I always get my fruits and vegetables from \"ok produce.\" They generally sell berries for $.99 to $1.99, and small bags of eggplant, apples, mushrooms, cauliflower, etc. for the same price ($1-$2). I'll get two full bags of fruits and vegetables and spend less than $10. Produce is always a good buy as well. Whether I need mussels, oxtail, or chicken I'm always guaranteed to get a good buy (and with multiple fish and meat markets you can take your pick). \nThere's also a spice/dry goods store that I LOVE. I buy loose leaf tea, spices, and lentils/other grains all the time. Again, super cheap and very varied.\n\nFood: The food is just ok. It's cool that they have pretty much any type of food you might want, but it's definitely not the best quality. The Indian food is underwhelming and the flavors are never on point, Japanese food is American Japanese and again not that great, but the soul food is pretty good. I wouldn't go to reading for the soul food alone, but if I have to eat there that's usually what I'll get. I'd recommend getting groceries and snacks in reading, and then eating in chinatown. \n\nSnacks/dessert: Beilers donuts are fresh rolled and amazing, reading terminal has addictive cannolis, and any of the bakeries has great croissants and other baked goods. I come to reading purely for the cannolis when i get cravings", "date": "2015-03-01 20:30:31"}

RTM is a huge public market with a lot of vendors - there are an overwhelming amount of options! From fresh produce, to seafood, to meat, to cheese, you can get almost anything here! You can get pastries, coffee, tea, ice cream,  Pennsylvania Dutch, Chinese, Thai, Mexican, Cajun, burgers, cheesesteaks, and more! There's even an oyster bar inside. Great variety! \n\nStopped in at lunchtime on a weekday and the place was just packed with people everywhere. No surprise that it's a popular stop for locals and tourists to get some lunch. The line at Beiler's Donuts was the longest, as was the line for Hershel's East Side Deli. There are communal seating areas, but at lunchtime the tables were filled. I came back the next day early in the morning and while not everything was open, there were definitely less people and less chaotic. \n\nWhat I was most interested in was the Pennsylvania Dutch businesses. There's a sign by the Dutch Eating Place that says the hours for the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants being Tuesday or Wednesday through Saturday, closing up at 3PM on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and closing up at 5PM Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. But I was there on a Monday and Beiler's was definitely in operation, though Dutch Eating Place was closed. Aside from Beiler's and the Dutch Eating Place, there's also Miller Twist that has soft pretzels and ice cream, and Riehl's which has cheeses, and Smuckers which supposedly is famous for their pot roast sandwiches. Other Pennsylvania Dutch vendors sell crafts and jams and honey. I returned the following day on a Tuesday to eat at Dutch Eating Place (separate review). \n\nOverall, RTM is a fun place to visit and a great option if you're not sure what you want to eat - there's bound to be something you're craving if you walk around long enough. I tried tea from the Tea Leaf, tea from Old City Coffee, ice cream from Bassetts, jambalaya from Beck's Cajun Cafe, a donut from Beiler's, a soft pretzel from Miller's Twist, and breakfast from Dutch Eating Place. Wish I stayed in Philly longer, so I could've tried even more stuff!", "date": "2015-04-06 03:21:38"}

This is a working man's breakfast providing you with the carbs and protein to get you through the morning until lunch. The sausage and eggs were just the perfect breakfast and the rest just reminded me of New Orleans. Rating: 5/5\n* Breakfast Po Boy is a French baguette with choice of fried eggs, melted cheese, andouille sausage, turkey sausage, or ham. These were the perfect sandwiches with just the right amount of bread to fillings. The turkey sausage had a light texture but flavorful. The Andouille sausage reminded me of a Hawaiian Portuguese sausage and eggs breakfast. I was in heaven! Rating: 5/5\n* Beignets (served on Sundays and Wednesdays) are French doughnuts/fritters served hot and topped with confectioners' sugar. Beck's makes the most authentic beignets outside of Louisiana. They have a beautiful golden brown crust and just the right consistency inside, not too dense and not too fluffy. If you've eaten beignets at Caf\u00e9 du Monde in New Orleans, you will absolutely love these! Rating: 5/5\n* Chicken and Andouille Gumbo is something my mom had to try. She loves gumbo and is certain this gumbo was made with love. The color is dark with the vegetables cooked down to their essence to flavor the gumbo base. The chicken and sausage add the meaty texture and flavor to the mix. Rating: 4.5/5\n* The Alligator Sausage Po Boy is topped with caramelized onion, peppers, and creole mustard. The alligator sausage is mild and lends itself well to the sweet flavor of the peppers and onions and the robust creole mustard. Rating: 4.5/5\n* Fried Oyster Platter is served with corn bread and choice of red beans & rice, white rice, or Cajun fries. The oysters were meaty and fried to a perfect golden brown with crispy outside and slightly briny and creamy on the inside. The red beans & rice was fantastic with nice pieces of sausage. Rating: 5/5\n* Muffaletta is salami, ham, mortadella, sharp provolone, and olive salad served on Italian bread. My husband and I used to make this sandwich every day at Caf\u00e9 Orleans in Disneyland. Beck's version was much better as there is more meat and cheese and they sandwich the olive salad between the meats which keeps the bread from getting soggy. We took these with us to the airport to enjoy before our return flight. The flavors of the different meats is just amazing and the olive salad had just the right amount of acidity to bring the sandwich together. The bread was very rustic with crunchy outside and tender yet chewy inside. Rating: 5/5\n\nBeiler's Bakery: \n* Apple Snitz Fry Pie is reminiscent of the Hostess handheld pies but tastes more homemade with a buttery crust and slow-cooked apple pie filling. They only make them on certain days so if you see them, buy a bunch. We missed our chance to load up before we headed back home. Rating: 5/5\n* Chocolate Whoopie Pie looks like a mini flying saucer with chocolate cake on the outside with frosting in the middle. The chocolate cake was marvelous with rich chocolate flavor and soft, spongy texture. The frosting in the middle was fluffy, creamy, and not overly sweet. They were so good, we brought a dozen home with us. Rating: 5/5\n\nSalumeria: They had beautiful French pates, cheeses, and meats. We picked up some imported prosciutto, capicola, Swiss, and provolone to make picnic sandwiches in the hotel room for lunch. The prosciutto had a grassy essence blended with the aroma of aged cheese. The closest taste and texture comparison upon eating some is that it's like butter with a salty porkiness and almost obscene. Unfortunately, my work day had not yet ended or I would have enjoyed a glass of Ros\u00e9 to complete the food experience. Rating: 5/5\n\nDutch Eating Place is a diner of sorts serving breakfast and lunch next to Beiler's Bakery. Since seeing Andrew Zimmern making and tasting scrapple, I had to have some. Dutch Eating Place served a Scrapple and Egg breakfast. I was so excited to finally try it and it was wonderful! If you like pork and liver, you'll love this. It is pork scraps mixed with cornmeal, wheat flour, and spices, like a savory pork cake. It fries up really well with a crispy outside and almost pate-like texture inside. Every meat vendor in Reading Terminal Market sold variations with pork, beef, and even turkey. Again, I wish I had a refrigerator in my room so I could have brought some back with us. Rating: 5/5\n\nMiller's Twist serves up hand-rolled Amish-style hot buttered pretzels. Man vs. Food's Adam Richman stopped by during his visit of Reading Terminal Market. You can watch as they roll and artfully twist pretzels. They also wind these beautiful pretzels around full size and mini hot dogs. The pretzel is golden brown with a beautiful glaze on the outside. The interior is chewy and works well with the hot dog. The mini dogs are two-biter and perfect to share as a snack. Rating: 5/5", "date": "2015-04-10 00:36:55"}

I did some research and decided to go with:\n\n- DiNic's for the classic roast pork sandwich. This was excellent! You can go with or without the rabe... I might go without next time because it can be a bit overpowering and mask some of the more subtle flavors of the pork and provolone. \n\n-Termini Bros Cannoli - Really good! A nice crisp shell, that somehow had a lightness to it. The cream was mild, with a very subtle tang and a hint of cinnamon throughout. It was not too sweet and you could actually taste the ricotta. which I appreciated. \n\n- Famous 4th St. Cookies - This was the only disappointing place to me. The cookie I tasted reminded me too much of Pepperidge Farms.\n\n- The Dutch Eating Place - This was pretty good. Everyone seems to order the Hot Turkey, which I would love to try next time. We got the sloppy joe, just for the sake of nostalgia! I also tried  shoo fly pie for the first time. This came from Pennsylvania Dutch next door. \n\nAlso consider trying the Peking Duck place.

Cheese shop right near the butcher had some of the best cheeses I have had in America and the guy was very informed and offered many samples, which was nice. And the Termini bros stand is not to be missed for a perfect cannoli! I only wish it was open later than 6 pm weekdays so it would be possible to stop by after work sometimes.", "date": "2015-06-22 20:14:05"}

Amish icecream - can't pass up the creaminess that's actually not heavy but quite refreshing. :)\n\nWe also had pretzels from Miller's.

Both are good, but I personally go against the grain and say the ones from Famous 4th Street's are better than Hope's. At least, if you're going for less decadent and less butter. If you like the sweet, heavy, buttery goodness, go with Hope's.

I was too weirded out to get that, but it would make a great passive aggressive gift. ;)\n\nFinally, swing back in the late afternoon - all the produce prices drop to ONE DOLLAR. I got an entire cantaloupe for $1, and strawberries by the pound for $1. Such a steal...and don't forget the fresh milk and yoghurt - these are as local as you can get!\n\nDinner: Carmen's Philly cheese, hands down.

The stands I always hit are: Dinic's (roast pork), Herschel's (pastrami), and Meltkraft (grilled cheese). For dessert, Basset's (ice cream) and Beilers (donuts). Everyone raves about the fritters at Beilers, but theyre much too sweet and oily for my liking. On the other hand, the plain glazed and powdered cream donuts are life changing. I'm hoping to branch out and maybe check out the Dutch Eating Place or maybe some of the seafood stands soon!\n\nTip: if you're bringing a car, you can park in the garages marked for reading terminal, grab a voucher, and get it validated by any vendor in the market when you spend over $10. 2 hour parking for $4!", "date": "2015-07-18 13:19:21"}

You really cannot go wrong with places to eat here. \n\nHere are my favorite 3:\nValley Shepherd Creamery & Meltkraft Grilled Cheese: Rivals Dibruno's for a cheese spot. Grilled cheese sandwiches are the best I've had. Valley Thunder (cheddar, brisket, mac n cheeese) is sooo good and try the Melter Skelter\n\nDiNic's: Maybe the most popular draw in the entire place and is wildly busy during lunch. Expect a big wait but it is a must try for their famous Roast pork (close 2nd to John's Roast pork) and roast beef.

I say this because my cousin and her husband had heard from friends about the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants, so they were a bit bummed that the timing didn't work out to visit their location during our time at the market. \n\nAll told though, this enclosed market offers a nice variety of coffee, dessert, and food options (if I lived in the area, I'd be going here all the time to buy fresh produce). There are also a variety of florist-type places and the like that add a great brightness to the market. I grabbed a coffee early in our stop at the market and enjoyed the experience of wandering through the place and taking in all the smells and sights around me. \n\nPrices with most vendors are reasonable, though also know that some portions of the market can get very congested (and very quickly) as the day goes on. This last time, I think we all arrived around 11am (and we managed to grab parking on the street right outside the market), but we were there about 20 minutes and the market really started to fill up. The place serving crepes, for example, had SO MANY people around it. \n\nTL;DR  Would certainly visit again, but I'd pick a different day of the week (Wednesday or Thursday, maybe?) and get there earlier in the day.

The most delicious looking donuts that they make in front of you, in so many flavors.  Can't wait to visit again!", "date": "2015-09-06 03:47:41"}

There are so many delicious smells, tastes, and sights here at the Reading Terminal Market. I also like how it's simply organized into \"streets\" and blocks. It feels like there is something here to cater to many tastes!\n\nTommy DiNic's (or just DiNic's) and Beiler's Donuts were divine!\n \n--- Detailed Review ---\n \nSeeing how this place had the 2nd most Yelp reviews in Philly (2nd only to Pats Steaks) AND 4.5 stars, I had to come here to check this place out when I flew to Philly en route to a place a few hours south. I am glad I did!\n \nDriving and parking here was a tad hectic, but I eventually found my way. The parking garage next door is $4 for two hours if you make a purchase of $10 or more from a Reading Terminal Market vendor. Just make sure to get your parking ticket validated. I would suggest walking and/or public transportation. I am going to do that next time.\n\nAs for the actual market, I was initially a little lost where I was, so I began wandering around. I eventually stumbled across a map near the restroom. This help me orient myself and explore the market. There are so many vendors, but they all relate to food, which is awesome!! Most of the vendors sell ready to eat foods like sandwiches, burgers, and pastries, but they are others that sell raw food like produce and seafood! \n\nFrom exploring, I noticed Beiler's Donut/Bakery corner had a long line and previous Yelp research led me to Tommy DiNic's. I had both and instantly fell in love with both! They were amazing!\n\nFor Tommy DiNic's, the roast pork sandwich with provolone and their broccoli rabe was such an amazing combination. The strong, but not overpowering, cheese complemented the succulent pork. The broccoli rabe provided that nice chewy texture. The bread's texture and taste was excellent along with containing all the extra juices of its delicious interior items. I also enjoyed putting the peppers they provided along the counters. It adds another depth of flavor along with a crunchy texture.\n\nJust a heads up, Tommy DiNic's is also referred as just DiNic's on the map.\n\nFor Beiler's Donuts, I tried the harvest apple and blueberry fritter. They were both amazing, but I liked the blueberry fritter more. Each bite was like a blueberry muffin that had been perfectly deep fried with that amazing crisp edge to it, along with being coated in a sweet, succulent glaze!!\n\nFor any Yelper, even those just using Yelp to find places, this is a must stop destination in Philly! There are just so many options in this market!!", "date": "2015-09-12 23:32:06"}

The one critique I would add is that it was a all day process mainly because they don't tell you the prices of the car upfront because they have to go by your income so every time you pick a car your interested in they have to submit the information to the financial counselor who is off site and that's takes up to 30 mins each time.

The cheese provides a tanginess and prevents the pork juice from soaking through the roll; the pork is slow-roasted and delicious, while the broccoli rabe provides some crunch and offsets the sweetness of the pork. Justifiably loved by many.\nThe many Amish stores there are also worth checking out; there's a fresh-made doughnut shop that's excellent and a country-style diner that serves breakfast fit for powering field hands.\nI had a great time there and would urge anyone to spend time there, especially on your first trip to Philly.", "date": "2015-11-06 23:51:42"}

I love doing my grocery shopping here cause I can get a lot for almost nothing. \n\nWhen you come here park in the parking lot that is on 12th street right across from the 12th St market entrance. If you park here you get 2 hrs of parking for $4 with a $10 purchase at the market. Just make sure to get it validated inside - you'll definitely spend $10.\n\nOK Produce, located right in the center of RTM (next to DiNics) is a great place for a college student on a budget to grab produce. They mostly sell dollar bags of produce that you then can slap the 10% student discount on. This place might not have the most quality produce but you get a bang for your buck. Iovine Brothers has nicer produce but you definitely pay for it. \n\nThe Amish are not usually there Sunday-Tuesday so if you go then you are playing your luck to get some of their tasty treats. They run a lot of shops with Reading Terminal and you are honestly missing out if you don't get something from Beiler's Bakery. Some of the best donuts in town. I also like their Mac n Cheese from the Rib Shack. Definitely worth trying! Also, I recommend going early the day before Thanksgiving and grabbing a pie from the Amish.\n\nAll the way in the back is the Nut Shop *or something along those lines* that sells coffee, rice, snacks, and tea in bulk. You pick out what you want and drag the bin to the front and ask the nice people behind the counter to weigh it out for you. It's definitely a good deal on a bunch of staple things. Plus they have some snacks that I used to get in my Naturebox *which I have now unsubscribed to*. It's definitely a good place to check out. \n\nThe final place I want to mention is Meltkraft. If you are a lover of Grilled Cheese, you gotta check it out. This is one of the most satisfying meals in the market and they are always have a specialty sandwich. Plus, each order comes with homemade chips. yum. \n\nAll and all, I am a huge Reading Terminal fan.

The one exception to that is parking. There is ABSOLUTELY no easy way to pull up and go in inexpensively or conveniently. There is parking across the street in multilevel parking lots which are often full & expensive. Aside from that fact, which I think can be improved on if they put their minds to it, the multitude of food aisles to walk up & down are exciting & delicious. You can go in for a snack or you can eat an entire meal or bring home groceries for a week. It is fresh and creative and flavorful at every single turn. You can grab fresh meats, fresh fish, prepared foods of any desired sort, desserts galore, and many beers & wine in their beer garden. It is a gastro-experience of gargantuan levels. I personally have been going here for over 30 years regularly. There are also many non food vendors such as gifts and crafts of a very nice quality, spice shops, & floral shops. There is a whole 1950s looking counter that goes along the entire front which serves Philly's famous & notable sandwiches & food fare. You have soul food, Italian foods, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, regular sandwiches, English pub fare, and on and on and on. There is a large seating area whereby you seat yourself. It is relatively maintained but can get a little messy at busier times. You also have bathroom facilities which are monitored and kept up.

The market is big, usually crowded (especially on weekends) and there are food options as far as the eye can see. Whatever you want to eat, they have it and more!\n\nWhen we came on a Saturday afternoon at about 12:30pm, the market was bustling. It felt like every tourist in Philly was here. From the moment we walked in, our stomachs began growling from the smell and sights of all of the food. There were so many delectable places to eat from our heads were spinning. However, with that said, I did have a few key observations, specifically about the vendors:\n\nPearl's Oyster Bar - From reading reviews, this is probably one of the most popular spots to eat at because they serve seafood and apparently very good seafood! When I passed by, the place was packed, although they had one of the largest seating areas of any vendor. \n\nBeiler's Bakery and Belier's Donuts - By far, the most popular desserts/pastry vendor in the market. The line for the donuts was the longest line I saw for any vendor and for a good reason as the donuts looked ridiculously amazing! We ordered a  1/2 dozen for ourselves and are still feeling the effects of how good the donuts were!\n\nMolly Malloy's - They serve tavern/gastropub type food. We ordered the Chicken Pot Pie from here as recommended by many online blogs. The Pot Pie was good, but not great. Although filling, it could've used a bit more flavor.\n\nBeck's Cajun Caf\u00e9 - The employees were handing out samples of their soups and Jambalaya, which made it all the more difficult to pass it up after trying out their food. As the name indicates, they serve Cajun, Louisiana style foods --- gator meat, po boys, Jambalaya, Gumbo, etc.\n\nBasset's - The only ice cream vendor in the market and, not only is it rich in history, but rich in many flavors! The employees here were extremely generous with the scoops of ice cream they gave on the cones we got. They were some of the biggest ice cream scoops I had ever seen.\n\nDiNic's Roast Pork - According to the hype, they have arguably the best Roast Pork sandwich in Philly. Unfortunately, we didn't have the stomach space to store the sandwich, but it's on my to go list. The line for the sandwiches was pretty deep too.\n\nThere were so many vendors and so many places to eat, I could go on and on about the vendors. If you come here on a weekend, just be prepared for the crowds. It will get hectic and, although there are tables towards the back, its a first come first serve. Trying to find an open table during peak hours can become an issue so many customers actually walk and eat as they go. It's all part of the fun of coming here and exploring the different types of foods served here. It's a must visit if you're in Philly!", "date": "2015-12-21 21:22:03"}

However, if you're someone like me you can get pretty over whelmed with the plethora of options and lose your appetite or simply get fustrated and go to Panera down the street. My best advice to the indecisive people like me is to know what you want before you get in there. Seriously. Before you enter decided on what you want to eat. Do you want American or Chinese ?

Hey, little did I know or realize that these railways (Reading, Pennsylvania, Short Line and B & O (Baltimore & Ohio)) actually existed!  Not only did they exist, the Parker Brothers strategically chose these railroads for their board game because of their routes and destinations.  Well, I've gotten over my ignorance as my business travels have taken me to the great city of Philadelphia many times.\n\nDuring my first visit, which I think was the most memorable, my taxi driver was kind enough to point out the Reading Terminal Market just as he drove into the porte coch\u00e8re of the Marriott hotel that I would stay at for a week.  The history and touristy draw of this market didn't dawn on me until I got into my room, began to read about it (and other Philadelphia \"hot spots\") and found that my room overlooked the market.  I was really excited about going to check it out right away but, having just come off an eleven plus hour flight, I, instead, opted for a short nap.\n\nWhen I awoke, I quickly jogged my way into the market.  This historic landmark is divided into 3 structures:  1- Reading Terminal Headhouse, 2-Reading Terminal Train shed and 3- Reading Terminal Market.  I found out that the Reading Terminal Market is located BENEATH the Train shed.  The architecture of the terminal is beautiful and was designed in the Italian Renaissance-style.  In parts of the market, you can see the engineering and construction details it took to build these immense structures.  Back in the day, it was an open-air Farmer's market.  This is a huge Farmer's Market that has been in operation since 1892.\n\nIt was dazzling to see so many vendors from various ethnicities or cultures ranging from bakeries, flower markets, fresh produce, ice cream and restaurants--All Under ONE Roof!  This market is a melting pot of The aromas, colors and sounds started to drive me wild.  I immediately started eating my way through market starting from the famed Bassett's Ice Cream (America's OLDEST ice cream company) to Termini Bros (Italian bakery - got my FIRST cannoli) and onto DiNic's (for an Italian roast pork, Provolone and broccoli rabe sandwich).   \n\nThis was a day of FIRSTS for me... I got to see and experience a bit of Americana, hear the local cultural excitement within this huge market and  smell and taste culturally diverse Pennsylvanian cuisine. Geez, I thought to myself that since I'd be in Philadelphia for a week and hadn't really scheduled any other dining plans, THIS was going to be my life-saver!  I had to try the Pennsylvania Dutch specialty, scrapple.  Ah, if you have to ask what it is, I'm not telling...it was just tasty!  Alas, I ended up dining at other noted Philly restaurants and only got to return to the RTM 3 more times to get myself to more cannoli, amaretti, biscotti, and those Italian roast pork sandwiches.\n\nGranted, the RTM may be more tourist-oriented but it sure was conveniently located to the Pennsylvania Convention Center which is in the Market East section.  I did return to shop and dine here on subsequent trips to Philadelphia.\n\nOh, just in case you're wondering... The reason why the Parker Brothers chose the Pennsylvania, Reading and Short Line (Shore Fast Line) railroads for the ORIGINAL U.S. Edition of Monopoly board game was because of their routes led directly to Atlantic City.  A side note:  B & O Railroad also operated on the East Coast but did NOT serve Atlantic City. \n\n#514", "date": "2016-01-14 07:55:05"}

It's super-exciting to see the locals and tourists get behind this historical institution. \n\nWhen you do decide to visit (because you can't miss it!!), make a beeline for Miller's Twist and order a traditional pretzel. It will blow your mind. Trust me, wouldya? Plus it will only cost $3 at most.\n\nNext up? Well, that's up to you- there's cheese, fresh juice, hot pork roast, Szechwan, fresh flowers, baked goods, hot apple dumplings and plenty of food  souvineers. My only regret is that we didn't have more room in our stomachs for the Yelp-adored apple dumplings. What a fun mix of people, sights and smells under one roof.", "date": "2016-01-22 22:13:27"}

So much food, so many options. It has EVERYTHING. Beiler's donuts, Bassett's ice cream, Dutch Eating Place's hot apple dumpling, Metropolitan Bakery's cookies, and many many more... Amish food here is amazingggg, so rich, decadent, sweet, and pure. Two words: food orgasm. \n\nI don't really come here for entrees. I'm not interested in real food -- I want desserts and other sweets!! I had tried Tommy DiNic's roasted pork and pulled pork sandwiches; they were great but didn't really stand out to me. I also had a hoagie at one shop (forgot the name), and it didn't stand out to me either. I think while the entrees here are good, there are plenty of other (and less crowded) places that have similar, and equally delicious, entrees. Plus, there are tons of food trucks in Philly that specialize in hoagies and sandwiches, and they're equally delicious and far cheaper! So, I mainly come to Reading Terminal Market for Amish sweets and non-Amish sweets. \n\nThe place is always packed full of people, so that's one con, but it's also full of delicious food. A must-go for everyone, tourist and local. I would go everyday if I could.", "date": "2016-02-07 02:31:41"}

For those unfamiliar, RTM is a large building consisting of many small businesses and stands ranging from groceries to eateries to miscellaneous goods. Only the listing on their website or a visit in person can give an accurate feel of the scope. \n\nOverall, the place is clean and you're able to find just about anything food-related you might have a craving for. Be prepared for an overload of options and  to spend a good deal of time here- even a simple walkaround can take an hour or two. Most businesses and eateries have their own review pages and websites for those curious. \n\nTwo important things to note: 1) The Pennsylvania Dutch retail section is not open the same hours as the entire market due to their beliefs and scheduling. This section is normally only open Wednesday to Saturday. 10+ of the stands are qualified as PA Dutch, Amish, or Mennonite and as such missing them is a significant chunk of the market.\n\nand 2) Parking is generally done in garages near to the market, though it can get expensive quickly. Even locals are sometimes unaware that if you do end up making a purchase, ask the vendor to validate your parking ticket for a significant reduction on 2 hrs of parking. (Though still not free)", "date": "2016-03-11 19:29:55"}

It goes without saying that this triple whammy made for a very crowded and chaotic experience. There was barely room to move and navigating between stalls may have involved the tactful use of elbows. \n\nNow, aside from the crowds, Reading Terminal is AMAZING. Craving something? Reading Terminal probably has it. There's an incredible selection and most things are very well priced so come hungry! We were only able to hit three places before getting full. \n\n12th Street Cantina- Veggie Quesadilla with chips and guacamole. The veggie quesadilla was great and the guacamole was sublime. You can tell that it is made fresh. Don't forget the napkins because eating this can get messy! Overall, I was very happy with my selection. \n\nIndian place that starts with an N (totally forgot the name)- only grabbed a potato samosa here but they have many of your typical Indian food options. The samosa was bland and disappointing. It was also wrapped in puff pastry vs the usual samosa shell which would've been okay had the filling been more flavorful. \n\nMeltkraft- I love grilled cheese. Meltkraft has sooo many options from the filling to what fat to grill your sandwich in (duck fat? Truffle oil? Garlic rub?) We decided to get the basic grilled cheese with added jalape\u00f1os. The cheese itself was very very good but after grilling the sandwich was a bit oily. I also would've liked more jalape\u00f1os in the grilled cheese. Almost an entire half of my sandwich was jalape\u00f1o-less. But the cheese was on fleek", "date": "2016-03-14 15:37:55"}

I love markets and after looking into some things to do in the area I decided that we had to stop by. My review will be a mix of us going initially on a Saturday (when it was crazy busy) then returning the next day where I actually got to experience the food. \n\n Y'all.....we must have gone on the worst day possible! Our first time visiting was on a Saturday and there was a volleyball tournament going on at the convention center across the street which meant that 2 billion people were at this market! Ok...maybe not 2 billion but a lot. This made it difficult to walk around to all of the vendors/restaurants. \n\n*Location- It's a busy area and we parked in the garage right across the street for $4 (2 hour max with $10 validation). \n\n*Food- SOOO much food!!! I was initially overwhelmed by the amount of food there was around me. (Note: this is not a bad thing.) After settling in we tried fresh blueberry and strawberry lemonade from a stand (sorry can't remember the name). It was amazing! We even brought extra to take home. Next, we ate at Pearl's Oyster bar for brunch on Sunday. I had the chicken and waffles benedict. *Le sigh* I really wanted to like this but I just didn't. The eggs were over cooked, the waffle was bland, and I don't think you can call that chicken breast (they more like crumbs of chicken breast). Next, my boyfriend tried a chocolate chip cookie from a stand across from Pearl's which he loved. We really wanted to try a few other places but some were closed I'm guessing because it was Sunday. Booo....\n\n*Overall Experience- I loved that there are amazing vendors and there was no way for us to try all of the greatness that was around us. On my next visit I plan to try some of the famous foods that were closed. If you're visiting the area you should definitely stop by. It's a busy place but well worth the trip. \n\n*Tips- Beware that many vendors are closed on Sundays. Also, there are restrooms and free wifi. Come hungry!", "date": "2016-03-22 01:52:45"}

While I appreciate the history, tenacity and in some cases brusque moxie of the RTM and its denizens, my first visit became a Dickensian experience as I sifted through retail debris to find hidden gems.  \n\nThe building retains remnants of bygone eras; bits of stone and architectural features hinting at the days of steam engines, horse-drawn carts, and the hubris of the 1920's.  It also reflects elements of social decay and the unfiltered byproducts of congested city living; patches of graffiti, cardboard condo residents (some verbally aggressive) and filth. \n\nInside you are met by a cacophony of sounds, colors, and aromas.  Determined to \"carpe diem\" the hell outta the place, my SO and I forged-ahead through the crush of people and visited almost every shop, stall and huckster.  Some of the highlights:\n\n- Iovine Brothers Produce.  Decent selection, many fresh options, reasonable prices and among other things, cold-pressed juice.  Had I been putting together a meal, much of my shopping could have been done here.\n\n- Fair Food Farmstand.  A small but quality selection of organic and/or local edibles. Stinging nettles and kombucha both found a place in my shopping bag.\n\n- Paprika Letterpress + Design.  A delightful proprietress using a century old printing press to create unique paper products for every occasion.  From modern to vintage, joyous to satirical, there is something to grab your attention. \n\n- Market Blooms.  Little can beat the beauty of fresh flowers.  Nature is the ultimate artist.\n\n- Beiler's Donuts.  Ubiquitous.  Everywhere you turned someone was holding a box of donuts with Beiler's printed boldly on the top.  When we finally found the source there was a line that looped around their space and extended beyond. It looked like it would take an hour to get a donut, so we moved on.  They looked and smelled fantastic.\n\n\nFinal Verdict:  Quantity over quality.  Dozens of mediocre shops selling pedestrian food, blah produce and uninspired crafts. Enough sugar and bad-coffee to leave the cities population sleepless for weeks.  However there are some business worth visiting and supporting - just be prepared to wait.", "date": "2016-03-28 13:15:16"}

We were there on a holiday weekend and there was also a Volleyball Tournament of some sorts going on at the Convention Center, so the lunch crowd was extremely chaotic.   It was rather challenging to keep up in a group of four where three of us had never experienced Reading Terminal before.  However, as expected, we lost each other a couple times while looking for a restaurant that didn't have a line completely wrapped around the corner.  This wasn't upsetting because this is a world famous spot.  I totally understood why it was so crowded.  Didn't upset me at all.  I found it rather exciting and adventurous.  I was also grateful they had street signs on the corners which helped us locate each other.  The maps were useful, too.\n\nThere were so many restaurants to choose from, but figuring out how to order your food while faced with crowds of people and ridiculous long lines was indeed a challenge.  Thankfully, everyone we encountered was quite friendly and the locals I spoke to were willing to explain the process.  No one seemed irritated by my questions.  I felt welcomed here.  \n\nWe fell right into place and found a restaurant that didn't have a long line that we could all agree upon.  We also walked around the entire facility and peeked at every shop.    \nWe were all very pleased with our meals from the Thai Food Market.  We look forward to returning and trying out foods from other restaurants.  \n\nNotes:  Crowd control is a must!  Line indicators/markers/signage would help tremendously.

In the back corner is a great Amish diner that has the best hot cakes around! Let me know if you agree!!", "date": "2016-05-19 14:38:56"}

I wish I could have had time to try every vendor in there, but I was only in town for a short weekend, and you can only eat so much in the span of 48 hrs. \n\nWe arrived at about 10:30 on a Sunday. Traffic wasn't bad at all and it was pretty easy to locate the parking lot, directly across from the market. Bring your ticket with you for validation from a market vendor. Parking is normally $29 for 2 hours, but if you spend $10, you can have your parking validated and it will only be $4 for 2 hours. Very reasonable.\n\nI forgot the Amish area of the market was closed on Sunday's, they are only open Tuesday - Saturday. Shame we missed those shops, I hear they have some very yummy stuff. Oh well.\n\nWe made a couple rounds through the market, trying to decided what we wanted.\n\nWe first got a cheesesteak with whiz from Spataros. Not bad but not my favorite cheesesteak in the city. Pass.\n\nWe wanted to try Wursthaus Schmitz but they weren't open quite yet.\n\nWe got two cannolis from Termini Bros, very yummy!\n\nAnd then tried the Ave. D from Milkcraft Grilled cheese. You can add bacon, tomatoes or have the sandwich grilled in duck fat. We chose the last option. It was dripping in grease, so I don't know if I would have gone with the duck fat, but it was still so decadent and amazing. Honestly I would go back for Milkcraft alone. Amazing stuff. \n\nI was worried we were going over our two hour parking window, but we got back to hour car with 30 mins to spare. \n\nVery cool place, highly recommend coming here.

Beware if you come here on an empty stomach, you will want to try so many things that I am sure you will get full quick... and buy too much!\n\nOver the years Reading Terminal Market has allowed people to try many various types of food.  Whether you are looking for a good sandwich, cheesesteak, Asian food, soul food, pastries, ice cream, donuts... it is all here!   \n\nNOTE: The general hours of Reading Terminal do not apply to ALL the food stands.  Some close earlier on specific days and a few (the Amish establishments) are not even open are Sundays.  Take a look at the operating hours of specific food stands you want to check out before you come here or else you may be disappointed that it is closed!\n\nSome of my favorite stands:\n\nBassetts Ice Cream - Ice Cream!\nBeck's Cajun Cafe - Gumbo!\nBeiler's Bakery - Doughnuts!\nCarmen's Famous - Cheesesteaks!\nFlying Monkey Bakery - Whoopie Pies!\nHershel's - Brisket, Corned Beef, and/or Pastrami Sandwich! \nMeltkraft - Grilled Cheese Sandwich!\nSang Kee Peking Duck - Duck noodle soup!\nTommy DiNiC's - Roast Pork Sandwich!\n\nThere are still other stands I have yet to try.

There are several entry and exit points, one being right by the Hilton. \n\nThis place is a foodie lovers paradise and overload!!! There is virtually something for EVERY palate. Want something fresh, hot, sweet, creamy, chocolate ears, something loaded with carbs to indulge your senses...they've got you covered here!!!\n\nThey have a LARGE produce section filled with an array of healthy options, I didn't spend much time in this section but everything appeared to be in peak freshness/ripeness. \n\nThere is a LARGE selection of fresh meats (steaks, roasts, ribs etc) and what seems to be an even larger selection of mouth watering deli meats to choose from. We are talking stacks of piled high meats ready to be consumed in between two slices of bread, topped on a cracker with a cheese spread (that they have plenty of) or to just snack on a lone. \n\nIf you do not want to make your own sandwich, they got you covered as well. You can walk over to another vendor that sells gut busting sandwiches such as: chicken Caesar, fresh mozzarella, chicken caprese, Pompeii etc. The sandwiches can either be purchase on loaves (better have a big appetite) or a more hand held option like ciabatta. A few steps over and you can purchase one of their ridiculously HUUUUUUUGE philly cheesesteaks, where they prepare the food in front of you. They also put on a show while they make it, which is kind of cool. Don't feel limited to just a traditional cheesesteak, you can get a chicken cheesesteak, pizza cheesesteak, broccoli rabe, BLT cheesesteak and on. You can also choose the cheese, be it provolone, American, or the east coats favorite cheese sauce. \n\nNext to the philly cheesesteak counter, they have pasta sheets that they will cut to your preference, while you wait for your food. You can pay at the same register. The pasta we purchased was seasonal, Pumpkin Pasta and it was terrific. \n\nIf you meander to the left of the cheesesteak counter, they have a variety of comfort foods ranging from lasagna, spaghetti, Stromboli's, chicken parmigiana, and meatballs. \n\nOnce you have quelled your hunger pangs, head over to their bakery section. There you can load up with cannoli's (filled to order), cheesecakes, torts, individual sliced cakes. Ever wonder what a chocolate shaped foot with almond toes, or Van Gogh's ear tasted like??? The also have a variety of caramel apples, plain, dipped in chocolate AND caramel or overloaded with chocolate chunks, marshmallows and drizzled in peanut butter. \n\nThere are plenty of other delectable delights in this jam packed market, too many to list. Come hungry and with plenty of ambition. You could easily spend hours, if not a whole day here. Lines can be long at times, and some counters require you to take a number. It is worth the wait and weight ;)", "date": "2016-09-21 17:41:44"}

Definitely get the greens and provolone, lest you end up with just a pile of meat on bread (not that there's anything wrong with that...)\n- Cannoli from Termini Bros: Oh my.

Nothing anywhere else compares, nothing even close. You will never buy a street pretzel or go to a chain pretzel place again. 2) Dinic's pork sandwich with greens. Beats a cheesesteak any day. 3) A chicken pot pie at the Dutch Eating Place. You won't have to travel to Lancaster County to get your Amish dining experience.

The one place we absolutely had to go to was the Reading Terminal Market.  We told our friends who we were visiting to take us there and give us the tour.  My friend is a mega foodie, so he knows exactly what to eat and when to go.  He made sure he told us it closed at 4pm, so that when I was inevitably running behind, he admitted it was actually closed at 6PM on Saturday...\n\nThere are a lot of people in this market, but its not so much where you cant comfortably move around.  There is action on every corner.  From restaurants, to bakeries, to candy stores...they have it all!  We made sure we had a delicious sandwich and we also had some famous donuts from a bakery who's line wrapped around multiple stores.\n\nThe only couple of things that bothered me, which are the reasons its not a 5 star is the prices are very high and it can be a battle to find a seat.  If you go alone or with another person your okay.  If you go as a group of 4, you may find it challenging.\n\nI highly recommend coming here to anyone who goes to Philly!", "date": "2016-11-05 16:26:13"}

I am not allergic to gluten but lately I've started to do some research and inform myself of what it means to become gluten free. So when I saw this stand I was so excited! It was so cool to see a such a unique option available. I went for the chicken wrap with mild sauce (sauce is not gluten free, but they were nice enough to notify me when I requested it). The wrap was about $8 and so delicious! It did not leave me extremely full but at the same time I wasn't left hungry, it was the perfect portion. \n\nLastly, I had to have some dessert and went to Bassette's Ice Cream. I chose their cookies and cream shake which was yum! Other people had ordered shakes before me and had extravagant orders (with whipped cream, chocolate syrup etc), whereas mine was a simple shake.

It's no grab-and-go thing, it's an experience that is part of living and cooking.\n\nIt is sometimes really crowded, especially when big events are at the Convention Center, go early or late.  Don't drive if you can help it... bike, or use transit - SEPTA's Market East Station PATCO, and NJT will get you from nearly anywhere to the RTM. Bring your own tote bags or even a backpack! Granny carts can be tough, especially on the weekend. You might stash yours, then return to load it.\n\nWhen you go, keep track of what merchants you visited... and always seek out new ones... if you don't you can end up not seeing the whole Reading Terminal Market.\n\nFinally, before you go to Whole Foods, or some other mega market, make a shopping list and see how much you can get from this wonderful place... like Barcelona's famous Boqueria, the RTM is a treasure and we are lucky to live near it.\n\n-- Michael McGettigan, director, Trophy Bikes PHL", "date": "2016-12-13 16:29:20"}

And, in case you don't have enough cash, there's plenty of ATMs around.\n\nCons: The low ceilings and over-abundance of hanging signs (with few way-finding signs) can make it difficult to navigate. I visited on a weekend day during the holiday season, so it was pretty chaotic anyway. This place can be packed - I mean body-to-body. You may have to wait in line no matter what you choose; and, you'll definitely have to stand around and wait for somewhere to sit and eat.\n\nI look forward to visiting the RTM again, during the week and not during the holiday season!", "date": "2016-12-14 18:10:28"}

I would recommend going on a weekday or making your way over early.\n\nI have yet to try all that they offer since it is much! The Amish donuts are excellent.

The bread items and chocolate are quite good however.\n\nThe groceries and the meat markets are good quality and local.

My one piece of advice for people going to the market for the first time would be to walk through the entire market first before selecting your food. Prices range wildly in there as does the quality. For example, my carrots and bananas would have cost over $3 at the vendor right next to the entryway, while another vendor only charged me $1.50. It pays to shop around in this market.

I usually do grocery shopping in here because their produce isn't outrageously priced, and they have a wide range because the vendors are from all over. I love getting \"exotic\" fruits. (\"Exotic\" meaning, not exotic to me but to the average American). On occasions they have dragonfruit, starfruit, lychee, rambutan, and even Asian mangos which I think are much better than the species common to the Americas. \n\nI love being in an atmosphere where there's a food craze!

I did some researching and came across this place. After reading reviews, I knew I just HAD to visit and laid out a list of all of the shops I was going to stop at. We came by on a Friday afternoon, around 1:00 pm and it was PACKED. It was insanely crowded. It was loud, crazy, busy, crowded and frankly, quite overwhelming. My boyfriend hated it- it was just so busy. And there wasn't a method to the madness, you just kind of had to walk into the crowd and try to figure out where to go from there. The complete and utter madness of the joint is why I deducted a star. I knew ahead of time that if you spent over $10 in the market and you saved your receipts, you could get parking for $4. Pretty awesome deal!\n\nHere are the vendors that I purchased items from:\n\nTermini Bros- Their cannolis are to die for. This is the second time that I've had them in my lifetime and I've never been able to find cannolis that I like better than these. What a delight. I HIGHLY recommend stopping here. \n\nMiller's Twist- After reading countless reviews raving about their pretzels with honey mustard- I had to try some. I am honestly not a big pretzel person (I know.. I'm a crazy person). I never order them at restaurants, never buy them for my house.. maybe it has something to do with the fact that I used to work at a german restaurant and ate them a lot there.. I don't know. Even though I don't love pretzels, I just HAD to try these ones after reading all of the reviews. WOW. They were literally, unbelievable. So tasty, so different, so fresh.. the best pretzel I have ever had. The honey mustard was so good and was the perfect pairing with the pretzel. I was blown away. \n\nFair Food Farmstand- When I came across this adorable farm stand in the midst of the insanely busy reading terminal market, I was super excited. They had fresh & locally grown produce among other local goodies. I went for a Baba's pink lemonade kombucha, which I loved! I never saw that flavor before and it was really tasty and refreshing.\n\nBassetts Ice Cream-  I heard this place was a must try, so I headed here to try some yummy ice cream after devouring so many savory items at the market. I wanted to try a blackberry cheesecake but when I was informed they were out I went with the classic moose tracks, which is always a good choice. It was super good and hit the spot. \n\nBy George! Pizza- YUM. They had sooo many yummy food items to choose from but I decided to try the eggplant pizza- a slice of it. Red sauce, cheesy with roasted eggplant - yummmm. It hit the spot after a long day of walking around the market.\n\nHerbiary- What an awesome little shop! There were so many things to look at, lots of holistic oils and lotions and herbs among other things. I purchased two \"dream balms\" , one for me and one for my sister. I love it, it smells wonderful and is very relaxing. \n\nOverall-- I had a great time. Yes, it was insanely busy.. but for a foodie like me, it was totally worth it.", "date": "2017-01-18 14:26:40"}

The vendors are incredibly approachable; I still regret to not having tried the famous donuts place because they had a long waiting line.

It was soooo crowded yesterday afternoon! Not sure if Sunday afternoons are always like that or if it was just because there was an event at the convention center across the street. Lots of stores seemed to be closed and it was partially under construction. The market is basically Pittsburgh's entire Strip District compiled in one room in the same building. Upside: don't have to walk far to get everything you want. Downside: limited space, crowds, long lines, slightly hard to navigate.\n\nI had pre-picked a few options to try. Unfortunately, most of them had such long lines, it would have taken 20 minutes just to order. I ended up going to Beck's Cajun and The Thai Market. Both had relatively short lines and were very tasty. After ordering, finding a table proved to be the most difficult part. There is limited seating and it seemed most were being occupied by people who weren't even eating (irritating). We tried to eat at a small vacant counter near a bakery and they asked us to move for sanitation reasons. We eventually found a seat, but it was not an easy task.\n\nIt's a really cool market. I've been to some similar set-ups that aren't as crowded and really love them. I definitely want to come back at a time when it's less crowded to get the full Reading Terminal Market experience.", "date": "2017-01-30 19:14:05"}

Some might stumble upon original and old school spots like Bassett's Ice Cream and Godshall's Poultry, or perhaps DiNic's (personal favorite) and Spataro's which have your beefy Philly staples ready to go. I seriously can't dive into everything in this market, but here's a quick food-type list of what you'll find just by walking around: Delis, coffee, BBQ, ethnic food, cheeses, condiments, chocolate, bakeries, seafood, wine, donuts, burgers, salads, teas, a buffet, plenty of fresh produce, and dodo bird eggs (okay maybe not that last one). Don't forget to stop in the PA general store or one of the book spots for something to remember your experience (besides your food baby). \n\nOnce you make your mostly edible purchases, if you'll be eating them immediately, there's plenty of seating areas scattered throughout. It's easy to stay and explore, but leave within two hours and you can get your parking ticket validated (as long as you spend 10 bucks in RTM, an easy feat). You'll then pay a great price of only $4. They want your business, and you should give it to them!\n\nOverall, the Reading Terminal Market is worthy of a visit in Philly just as much if not more than the Liberty Bell. Yep, I went there. So go forth and eat something! You won't be disappointed, because the Terminal will grab hold of your senses and you'll see, hear, smell, touch, and definitely taste exactly what I'm talking about. Thanks for the food, Philly.", "date": "2017-02-19 16:39:03"}

Go to the butcher and choose the cut of meat you want and at the fish market you can stare back at the fish lying on ice.  Of the Market also offers live lobsters.  For people like me with a sweet tooth, there are a few bakeries and pastry shops.  The variety is endless.  The produce shops are amazing.  I can buy a box of blackberries for one-third or less of what I pay at the supermarket.  Same with many other fruits and vegetables.  Another treat lies in the various Amish shops that provide some wonder food and bakery items, as well as a variety of other things.

It is especially convenient if you are staying at a nearby hotel like the Marriott Downtown since the market is not even a block away.  \n\nSo this market is a giant warehouse, and there are vendors literally everywhere.  It has many entrances, one of them being for a diner that is the only thing open 24/7... everything else closes at 6:00.  The food isn't just limited to grocery shopping - aside from the diner, there are plenty of sit-in restaurants too (and some have happy hour!).  There are bakeries and ice cream parlors too.  This place isn't just limited to food, either - there were a few vendors for gifts and for African wear and decor as well.  \n\nThe only food I got to try was from a taco place.  It was a chicken taco with very generous portions of everything.... the sauces, the meat, the guacamole, all of it.  How did it taste?  INCREDIBLE.

Gorgeous, locally grown produce and value added products made with love. Not to mention, you can use Philly Food Bucks and double up dollars if you're on SNAP! Whoo! \n\nThere were multiple large produce stands, Amish cheese makers, fresh fish and poultry stands, and all the prepared foods of your dreams. If I hadn't been financially fit an eaten breakfast at home I could've had more than a delicious iced chai from Old City Coffee. I circled the building a couple of times and I believe this was the only coffee station. (Thumbs down) but my drink was tasty!\n\nThe market is a great place to go if you're with a group and everybody is wanting something different.

Head over to Carmen's Famous Cheesesteaks and get in line! Vegetarian cheesesteak is on the menu and seitan is the steak!

It was pretty damn tasty.  \n\nThe bf had a pastrami from Hershel's East Side Deli and simultaneously wished he had room for the pulled pork from DiNic's right next door.  Next time.\n\nI've also eaten at the Dutch Eating Place and loved the whole Pennsylvania Dutch vibe that I missed from when I visited Lancaster a few years back.  Just note: not much to choose from if you're a vegetarian.  Also, their famous apple dumplings were sold out on my last visit.  Boo!\n\nFour Seasons Juice and Smoothies Bar is AMAZING.  The ladies are so clean about everything and the menu changes somewhat seasonally.  They have the best looking wheatgrass, too!  A must after indulging too much, leaving and walking around, then coming back for a nice tall fresh squeezed juice or smoothie.\n\nDon't leave here without having a donut (or 3) from Beiler's Donuts....my personal favorites are the fritters.  Apple or blueberry.  Blueberry fritters, people! But the plain, sour cream or glazed are also good.  Everything else is too cloying with the goopy creams all over them.   Long line? No worries.  It moves really fast.\n\nThis was my third time here and I have ruined all my other plans for eating in the city by coming here first.  So....

They do sell groceries, in that there are some stands selling fresh produce or meat - I seem to recall that having a few of these to serve local buyers who live nearby is a condition of the market continuing to operate.  But mostly, the Reading Terminal Market is a big noisy crowded bunch of prepared food stands, with a couple sit-down restaurants thrown in. \n\nThe food served here varies from Chinese to cheesesteaks to seafood to diner fare, and it all ranges from good to very good (though I think Philly has several better places to get a cheesesteak if you're spending more than a day or two in town). I especially like the pizza sold by the large Italian stand,  and on certain days of the week there is an Amish shop inside that serves good breakfast.  There's also a historic ice cream shop that has been selling ice cream longer than any place else in USA and has sold to Presidents, etc.  The market building itself is historic and it's good to see an old building being put to a creative re-use, particularly in this part of the city where chain stores and blight need to be fended off.  If you are staying or working within walking distance, the Market is definitely worth a stop for lunch or snacks. \n\nHaving said all that, given that to go to this market I have to drive in or take public transportation in from Chesco, which has its own awesome food places and Amish markets, the Reading Terminal Market has been kind of a three-star experience for me over multiple visits. The biggest problem with the place is parking. If you come by car, be aware there is little or no street parking and you will have to park in a garage.  There are a couple of garages that will give you a couple hours of deeply discounted parking with a ticket validated by a market vendor, but finding the garage entrances in busy traffic can be tricky, the time you are allotted to park is cutting it close if you wanted to see the whole market or eat at several places, and you really have to watch the time because if you go over your time limit at all then the price goes way up to over 20 dollars.  Also, the last time I drove down there, I had an argument with the parking cashier who tried to charge me 27 dollars although I had a properly validated ticket and was not over my time limit (way under).  She was on the phone and just couldn't be bothered.  I wondered how many tourists would not have realized she made a mistake and just paid the grossly inflated fee for under 2 hours of time.  I recommend walking or taking public transportation here if you possibly can.\n\nNext issue is that the entrances and exits of this market often have aggressive panhandlers who harass shoppers for a handout.  I've had the experience of saying no or trying to walk away and having one of these street people chasing after me shrieking and verbally harassing me because I somehow \"disrespected\" her by not responding to her demands for money. No security or police presence in sight once you get outside the doors of the market. \n\nFinally, this place gets very crowded on weekends, so if you are coming to eat, plan on fighting the crowds and standing in a long line to get your food.  Many of the people visiting are tourists and as such hold up the line further by asking questions, asking for special orders, not being totally familiar with payment methods, and/or blocking traffic in the aisles before or after they get their food.  This is a \"kid friendly\" place which means that there are a lot of families with kids dodging about, strollers, etc. creating more congestion. It can also be hard to find a place to sit down with your food and many of the tables and chairs are the uncomfortable sort that you find in high school cafeterias. I'd really rather take my food home to eat it, but given that I live some distance away, taking home melty ice cream or pizza that will get cold is not a good option. The earlier you can go and beat the crowd on the weekend, the better.  \n\nYou can also tell this place was not originally constructed as a market or food court because, unlike some other cities where the markets have higher ceilings and an open-air feel, this place has a pretty low ceiling and little air circulation, and when crowded it gets hot and feels cramped. If you come in colder weather, be sure to dress in layers you can easily shed, or you'll be roasting to death by the time you've made it up and down the aisles. \n\nBottom line:  good place to go if you can walk or bike there or you're visiting and want a taste of Philly all in one place.  If you live in the burbs and can more easily drive, walk or bike to other markets and restaurants in your own area, then maybe worth doing once or twice but not on a regular basis, in my opinion.", "date": "2017-04-10 20:19:45"}

I think I faintly remember trying the roast pork sammie from Tommy DeNic's but even if I did, I can't remember what it tastes like. So this time around, I decided to document everything, so that if I do visit Philly again, I'll know what to get (or what not to). Here is everything we ate:\n\nTommy DeNic's: Roast Pork with Provolone and Broccoli Rabe - this was a nice break from the cheesesteaks that we've been eating. The pork was cooked perfectly, and there was a good amount of provolone and broccoli rabe. It does get messy though, so it's not really a sammie that you could eat on the go.\n\nMeltKraft : Melter Skelter ('Melter Skelter' Raclette 3 Month, pickled green tomatoes, jalape\u00f1o, BBQ potato chips, and watercress) - this was good, but not worth $9. I don't know what it is about grilled cheese, but I just can't find a grilled cheese anywhere that's worth paying $10 for.\n\nBeiler's Doughnuts - bought a few doughnuts from here - one crumb, the second cinnamon, and the third I can't remember. This had the longest line. The line wraps around other stands. People seem to buy these doughnuts up by the dozen. My boyfriend really enjoyed the doughnuts but to be, they were just doughnuts. But then again, maybe it's just because I'm not a huge fan.\n\nHerschel's: Corned Beef Sandwich - although I only tried a few bites, the corned beef was pretty good. It wasn't overly salty, like corned beef tends to be. The pickles are great.\n\nOverall, the market is a great place to try out a bunch of different foods. But it'll cost you.", "date": "2017-04-18 00:24:17"}

He wished he had an extra stomach so that he could eat the whole thing. \n\nIt's a little too crowded to make walking around enjoyable at all, but that's not the fault of the market.

Although it can be quite confusing which direction to go, there are maps that are on the wall to help guide you to the vendor you would like to visit.\nThe location of the market is conveniently close to popular parts of the city. It is a short walk to the old city where you can visit and tour the liberty bell and independence hall. Also close by is philly's Chinatown. \nA good tip to keep in mind if you have a car to park is that the Reading Market has two parking lots on 12th and the other on 11th that offer discounted parking. You just need to take your parking ticket, spend at least $10 in the market at one of the vendors, ask the vendor to validate your ticket and you are set. It will give you two hours of parking for $4. After that the rates increase, but still a pretty good discount.", "date": "2017-04-19 21:14:11"}

If you've been to Seattle's Pike Market, then this is a more urban and New England version of it. It has produce from farms, heritage varieties, fresh eggs, cheddars, deli, meats, and bakeries that offer mouth watering pastries. There's also a large variety of food stands and stalls that offer a very impressive variety of foods from barbecue, to breakfast, desserts, Indian, African, and Hillel foods. \n\nPrices- That's what everyone always wants to know especially if it's a tourist attraction. So in terms of produce, it's not bad priced. Not as high as whole foods, but certainly not your Italian Marketplace where you can haggle your way down to pennies. One can probably get some quality farmer produce for a reasonable price of like 1.99$/lb for apples or 2 for 1$ corn to give an idea of the ballpark range. The food is also pretty reasonable priced. You can get a whole lunch set for less than 10$ and the portions are large. You can order most foods for less than 10$ here. \n\nHours- so this place is open until 6 pm on most days, so if you're going to go, do not bank on this place on being your dinner place, because chances are most of the produce will have been sold off, stalls are closing, and you may be left with whatever is leftover (meaning smaller selection). I recommend hitting this place for lunch or even late afternoon stop as you wrap up your activities. \n\nFood: What to try- there are a few places that have their original site outside the marketplace. Meltykraft and Metropolitan Bakery have their own stand alone branches outside of this marketplace for example, so I recommend trying places that cannot be found outside- this may require a little more research, but the Indian food place for 9.99$ lunch set looked amazing and line moved fast. The Amish desserts are also a hit here as well. \n\nAmount of time recommended- you can probably spend a couple of hours in this establishment. It is massive and overwhelming. It has almost everything, so don't go in starving because you'll probably just wind up sitting at the first place you see and stuffing your face and then be sad you can't put down the amazing looking treats ahead.", "date": "2017-04-20 12:35:50"}

I've made it a tradition to try a different cheesesteak every time I visit philly, and this was probably one of the best thus far (second to Barclay Prime's if you count that)! The classic I got had mushrooms, onions, and sweet peppers, with the iconic cheese whiz on the bread. Full of flavor, however a little on the salty side with the cheese they used. The bread was my least favorite part, as I have definitely had better. It was kind of rubbery to me, but I did buy a few more for home and retoasting them made a huge difference. \n\nIf people were to ask me what my favorite Philly cheesesteak is, I would refer them to Carmen's!

There were carcasses hanging on hooks of every edible animal imaginable, some animals wtere still alive,  waiting for the axe.\nIt was unbelievable!  My mom made me sit with her and drink buttermilk at Spataro's, we ate with the Amish and had ice cream at Bassett's. \nLater in life,  I worked near the RTM and if I didn't visit there everyday,  I got a bad case of the shakes.

ALSO, not many people know this, but the terminal validates parking! Park in any nearby garage and bring your ticket so it can be stamped. You can get a stamp at virtually any place where a good or food can be purchased. You need to purchase something for a validation. You can stay in the terminal all day or just 10 mins and it will only cost you $4.00 to park with a validated ticket. Sometimes I park, run errands, hop in the terminal for some grub, validate my ticket and then go get my car.

There is no shortage of things you *want* to try so it's just a matter of figuring out how to try the most of everything. It's concept is very similar to places like Pike Place (Seattle), Grand Central Market (Los Angeles), etc...\n\nLines for some vendors were certainly much longer than others, but most still moved fairly quickly. Staff at most food stands were also incredibly friendly and willing to chat up locals and tourists alike. Most visitors to Reading Terminal Market are also very friendly - I really only had one passing negative incident where a man pushed me out of his way and into one of the display cases at the Pennsylvania General Store. \n\nOf all the things we tried, my favorites were easily:\n\n1. Beiler's Donuts: the fritters are a must. We even flew some back across the country to the Bay Area. A little reheating and they were just as fluffy and springy as bought fresh!\n\n2. Herschel's Deli: while the pastrami was good, the corned beef was the real winner. Excellent flavor, stacked nice and high, good slaw. Yum.\n\n3. Carmen's Famous Cheesesteaks: wiz is cool, but I like my real cheese. Their provo sauce is made with a mixture of provolone and cream cheese. Their steak was also of a much better quality than that of Pat's/Geno's.\n\nWe also tried:\n\n1. Dutch Eating Place: probably should have gotten something sweet as it seemed like this is what they are really known for but the chicken pot pie was still pretty good.\n\n2. Hunger Burger: fresh lobster mac and cheese came our when we passed by...it was a non-negotiable order at that point.\n\n3. Miller's Twist: I don't know of a baked pretzel I've adored more as of recently...\n\n4. DiNic's: The roast pork was okay, definitely not the best sandwich I've had", "date": "2017-06-11 19:24:39"}

Tons of places to eat about anything anyone could want, a market, bakery, etc.....\nWe chose the deli and opted for the corned beef sandwich.  It was huge and tasted fantastic.  There are so many choices that you could go there every day and have something totally different each day.  \nThe Reading Terminal Market is certainly a place to stop, especially if you have a group of folks with different tastes.  \nIt is a bit hectic inside and not easy to maneuver around the place but there is no shortage of interesting things to find inside.\nWe would definitely go there again the next time we are in Philadelphia.", "date": "2017-07-14 19:13:41"}

It's one of the most well-known indoor markets in the country, so stopping by is a must if you're in Philadelphia.\n\nPROS:\n- Multiple dining options! From Cajun dishes to homey soul food and delicious breakfast and brunch items, there is a little bit of everything for everyone.\n- Moreover, there is always something new during your next visit! With all of the vendors inside, it is difficult to eat everything you see in one visit.\n- $4 parking at 2 different garages for 2 hours! All you need to do is take your parking ticket, spend $10 at ONE vendor and have that place validate it for you before you return to your vehicle and pay.\n- The vendors are all friendly. Smiles were abound and enticing dishes were everywhere to be found!\n\nCONS:\n- Crowded and touristy. I accidentally \"shouldered\" a high schooler (or middle schooler?) from out of town because of how crowded this place gets (and because he was hogging the aisle).\n- The open seating area is limited. You have two options: Wait for a table to open up OR you could join one. Some vendors, like Molly Malloys, have their own seating area. My family and I were fortunate enough to grab a table after a few minutes of waiting and, seconds later, two people joined us at the table. I'm totally fine with this, but hopefully part of the ongoing construction includes additional seating areas.\n- Lines, lines, lines! Everyone wants a taste of the delicious doughnuts at Beiler's or the famous Roast Pork Sandwich from DiNic's, so expect to wait awhile at the popular vendors/stalls.\n\nAll things considered, RTM is a great place to grab a bite or even shop for a few groceries! I love the idea of indoor markets and food halls, so visiting this place was a great experience. I'm looking forward to my next visit.", "date": "2017-07-16 03:19:50"}

Any pretzels from Miller's twist - $2.5 (soooo delicious)\n2. Roast pork sandwich from DiNic's - $8-10 (very intense provolone taste, voted best in many food magazines)\n3. Gumbo at Beck's Cajun Cafe - $10 (lots of flavors, big bowel, a little bit salty)\n\nAdditional things to try (from other viewers)\n1. Beiler's doughnuts\n2. Roast duck noodle platter at Sang Kee Peking Duck House\n3. Apple dumplings at Dutch Eating Place\n\nIf you want to explore, I'd recommend going aisle by aisle first to see what's available before you settle down.

I'm so sorry- my mind was completely boggled I couldn't really remember the names). Not a huge roast beef fan- or so I thought... the portion is big. I shared one with my boyfriend and we weren't able to finish (but maybe it's because we ordered way too much elsewhere)\n3) the cured meat/ deli meat stand- I haven't been to Barcelona but my boyfriend has and he was immediately reminded of his food experience there one bite into the prosciutto. We were shamelessly grabbing at the prepackaged back and ripping it apart like complete savages while walking around\n4) there's a corn dog stand- the chili fries!! Don't knock it till you try it. I've had fries EVERYWHERE. Literally. I always make an excuse to order fries with every single one of my meals. How fries manage to stay crispy under the layers of chili? I'll never know", "date": "2017-09-07 13:42:43"}

No. It's all mediocre, at best.\n\nLocals go to local farmers markets that are full of local farms. Check out the Food Trust for a listing of when and where!

Snakes in the grass.\n\nThe seafood markets, well, again, look what you're buying. Most of the time the fish is dry looking and fishy smelling. No bueno.\n\nThe bar is meh. Philly has too many great bars to deal with the crowds of RTM.\n\nOk, Beilers....well, they're a game changer, and the only reason I visit. They have the best baked goods. Period. \n\nDinics, too.

It really hadn't changed that much (save possibly different vendors).    I arrived in Philly just around a quarter to one on Saturday.   After trekking it to La Reserve B&B to check in, I made my way back in search of a place called By George that had gotten rave reviews for their cheesesteaks.   Little did I know that they were located inside of Reading.\n\nSo I got there around 2:30 and it was quite the madhouse.   It took a long time to figure out where By George was but I eventually found it.   Of course there was a long line but it actually moved relatively fast.   The next challenge was finding an open spot in their food court area to devour the cheesesteak.    I eventually did find a place and as I finished I scanned the crowded area and saw Flying Monkey which looked to have some interesting desserts.\n\nAfter my lunch I went to Flying Monkey.   I was checking out the desserts near the line.  The one dessert that caught my eye was their butter cake.   I was about to turn towards the line when I encountered a rude grandma who sternly told me to move out of the way so she can get in line.   I told her I was in line and she was ready to fight me.   When she realized I wasn't going to move, she bitched and moaned the whole time.  I looked away from her but could feel her steely eyes staring me down.    I eventually got my order of butter cake and left.   I imagine with the crowds there are probably a few fights that break out.\n\nI found the cake so delicious I made a return trip to Reading the next morning on route to heading to the airport.    It was a lot less crazy and if I were living in Philly, I'd definitely opt for going in the morning to avoid the crazy grandmas and the large crowds.

It's so much more fun when you can try out a bunch of spots and just split it with friends. \n-A lot of the merchants are closed on Sundays (Amish thing) so if you're coming on the weekend, Saturdays is your day!\n\nReading terminal,  until we meet again!", "date": "2017-11-09 18:34:55"}

Two of the merchants are even descendants of original vendors from the 1800's, how cool is that??!! Reading Terminal is great for grocery shopping, and lunch.. although it does get quite overwhelming with crowds at lunch.

I'm not going to list my fave food and market vendors because I love so much that is here and they would all be on the list. An awesome market, highly recommend!! Ah yes, I can't forget to tell you about Philbert! Philbert is the lovely 3' plump bronze piggy bank sculpture in the center of the terminal, he collects coins for charity. Eric Berg is a VERY special local Philadelphia sculptor, whose work is all over the city in major parks, the bear in Fitler Square, the dragon at Drexel, the vine covered cottage gate in Rittenhouse square, the sphere at Pennsylvania hospital and so much more.

There's tons of merchants and vendors inside the terminal to choose from, too many I can't even count so I will list my favorites:\n\nBeiler's Donuts - OMGOODNESS, the east coast knows how to make dounuts and this place is no different.  Make sure you stock up on Saturday because they are closed on Sundays.\n\nValley Shepherd Creamery - this cheeseshop is known for it's grilled cheese sandwiches.  The Somerset is a must!\n\nFour Seasons - if you're looking for a health kick this is the spot for you.  An assortment of fruit smoothies to choose from.\n\nKeven Parker's Soul Food Cafe - Food Network Rated Best Fried Chicken, this is a must stop at the terminal.\n\nThe Reading Terminal has it all, a wide variety of food to choose from, sit down restaurants, you can even do a little produce shopping for the house.  If visiting Philly try to get a hotel near the terminal as it will be your one stop for a quick and delicious bite.", "date": "2017-12-28 17:04:03"}

I really enjoyed Iovine Brothers Produce, very affordable and fresh!  I've also eaten at a few of the restaurants here and for the most part, the food is flavorful, tasty and affordable.  I enjoy browsing the food vendors, I've had good ice cream by Bassets and good sandwiches at Hatfield Deli.  I also enjoyed Godshall's Poultry, very affordable, fresh and tasty chicken.  I've browsed John Yi's fish market too and things looked good there but I'm still not the biggest fan of fish, so I passed on it.  I think the catch with this market is to check the prices.  I thought that by going here everything would be cheaper, not necessarily, sometimes things are more expensive than one would think, so buyer beware.  For the most part though, I'm glad that Reading Terminal Market is around and I'd love to check them out again.  They remind me of Pike Place Market in Seattle, in a way except for the fish throwing, lol!", "date": "2017-12-28 19:23:27"}

Every other City along the Eastern Seaboard wishes it had a market as lavish and spectacular. Basically it is food Paradise with all kinds of deliciousness inside. A lot of it is overpriced and touristy, but there are also some amazing hidden gems lurking within the walls, particularly those which are owned and operated by the Amish, who have a very large presence within this Market.\n\nSpeaking of very large presents... (pulls down pants)... happy Amishmas.\n\nThe number one highlight is Miller's Twist which is where you will get the best hot gooey pretzel you've ever had , which will make you never want to eat a pretzel from anywhere else, and will make you speak in very long sentences, and I mean very very long sentences. \n\nAlso try their lemonade and chocolate milkshakes which are amazing. Make sure you get the plain pretzel. Or if it's a flying pretzel, the plane pretzel. The only other pretzel that I've had which compares is down at Sadie Anne's at the Dutch Village Market in Upper Marlboro Maryland. \n\nNext on the agenda you have to go to Smuckers Grill and get a Pot Roast Sandwich. The breakfast there is ok but the pot roast is otherworldly and sensational. Truly one of the best sandwiches in the world. You do not come to Philadelphia for cheesesteak sandwiches. You come here for other sandwiches such as John's Roast Pork and Nick's Roast Beef and this gem here in the Market at Smuckers.\n\nThe Dutch eating place is also very good as are many of the other stands in here like Beiler's donuts. But the next top highlight belongs to Tommy Dinic's. Roast pork is the sandwich that Philly should be famous for, and the only place that makes it better than Tommy is John's which is the ultimate pork destination. Tommy does a wonderful if overpriced roast pork with broccoli rabe. And I highly recommend asking for extra broccoli rabe. Once again skip the cheesesteak. If you must get one, try one when you go to John's, or grab one at Joe's Steaks & Soda Shop, along with some shakes.\n\nParking here is an absolute nightmare and they give tickets out the way molesters give candy out to children while hanging out of dark unmarked vans. I highly recommend using the parking deck and just paying the lofty prices to avoid the drama. Alternatively, park somewhere cheap far away, and walk into the center so that you aren't paying for every minute you're here. The parking meters and garages here are almost as much of a rip off as your Aunt was last night.\n\nAnd if your friend Adel is hungry, I'll take him to the market, and will duly Fill Adel For Ya.", "date": "2018-01-11 17:54:38"}

It has had its shares of ups and downs, but it seems to be going on stronger than ever now. It's not just all restaurants here either, you could skip out on going to a grocery store and get all of your produce, meat, poultry, flowers, alcohol, and much more all here.\n\nObviously with it being a market, you need to come in here absolutely starving to make the most of the selections at Reading. There are foods of all types and you will get stuffed by the time you leave. \n\nIf you do end up driving to Reading, there are two main garages that you can park at, and make sure you bring your ticket with you. If you spend ten or more dollars at one place, a merchant can validate your ticket for a discount on parking.\n\nWhile there are so many options here, I can recommend:\n\n- Miller's Twist for pretzels (Seriously the best pretzel ever)\n- Tommy DeNic's for a roast pork sandwich \n- Beiler's for just about any donut you can think of\n- Little Thai Market for chicken red curry\n- 4th Street Cookie Company for what else, cookies\n\nI suppose the only downside to this place is that it's only open until 6 pm. If it was open late, I don't think I could eat anywhere else. \n\nIf you've never been here, do yourself a favor and go here now.", "date": "2018-02-01 21:29:38"}

Reading has plenty of produce stands, fish and meats counters, nuts, soaps, grocery, pantry staples that are hard to find and olive oil stands and the endless options of foods to choose from at lunch rush or for the sweet tooth in all of us, pastries, cakes, cookies and candies. There are gelato vendors, shakes and of course flowers for your home to make it all springy and pretty or just buy a bunch and give to someone you love, just because.\n\nThey have an amazing oyster bar if you love oysters, Greek Food, Italian, Middle Eastern, Soul Food, Thai, you can literally choose anything and be happy-happy-happy with it. I personally enjoy the roast pork sandwich,  the pork is tender, flavorful and so juicy the broccoli rabe is bitter-garlicky-spicy goodness with the melty provolone cheese YES!! I ate half and brought the other half home for the MR. (cuz he had to work and couldn't come with us. \n\nSo my purchases were cheese, pate, pastries, candy (of course), fresh veggies, fruit, a huge cow bone cut in half for Kona & Luna at a reasonable $2.50 lb or something like that.

You have just about any type of cuisine you can imagine available to you in a very compact space. If I have any complaint at all, it is that the crowds make the place almost unmanageable at meal times. Still, though, it is worth it. Try Spataro's for a cheesesteak, Dinic's for the roast pork, or Bieler's for a donut. Even the hot-dogs at Miller's Twist were amazing. The only place I had that was below my every-rising expectations was Nanee's Indian Palace. The naan there had been sitting around in the hot box all day and was delivered to me stiff as a brick. I even saw the owner check it for softness before he gave it to me, so he knows it is a problem and he gave it to me anyway. But, I digress. Go to the market and pick a place at random.

Dessert highlights are 4th street cookies which does a chocolate chip dipped in chocolate and serves coffee for $1 and Beiler's Sweet as Fudge where you can get donuts for $1.15! Come hungry and leave satisfied!", "date": "2018-03-28 19:39:19"}

Flooded with variety of food options, fresh as they can get, we were tempted to try everything. The air was filled with the aroma coming from the food vendors, restaurants, bakeries, coffee, ice cream. I wanted to try everything I can eat. Constrained by the time, we tried French and Italian bakeries, and Mediterranean. The fresh baguette, focaccia, bagels, pastries, cannolis, and hummus-carrots were meddling with our taste buds. The coffee here is the best you can get anywhere. We left tempted as we hurried towards the next destination. However, later in the day while crossing this again, we came here for a quick pick up of cheese-tomato baguette to satiate us while we explored the endless options in this market. It is like inside farmers market which has everything, fun, food and fresh produce. It is part of Philadelphia culture and highly recommended on your visit/ stay.", "date": "2018-04-23 18:53:32"}

Very hearty jewish deli classics like matzo ball and chicken noodle soup, latkes, kugel, hot dogs, potato knishes, bagels with lox, New York-style cheesecake, and, of course, hot deli sandwiches stuffed with homemade corned beef, pastrami, or brisket.

The hustle and bustle of vendors setting up, the aroma of fresh baked Artisan bread, the smell of just brewed hot coffee - mixed with the occasional off-scent of freshly butchered meat or fish - totally transformed my world for a few minutes from hectic \"day-to-day-today\" to a more bucolic boyhood.\n\nIf you want it, Reading Terminal Market most likely has it. From eats to sweets to handmade chocolate treats and handmade crafts. Sit down and enjoy a cup of distinctively fresh coffee while watching the scurrying workers around you.

Hustle and bustle crowd. It's everything I like in an eatery. Long lines, no problem! We were recommended to come here and glad we did as our second stop on our food tour in Philly.\n\nWent to Beiler's for donuts, best was the apple fritter but the Oreo donut was awesome too. Then dropped by Sang Kee Duck for some roast pork and duck. Both were pretty good, not the best I've ever had but hits the spot. After that we walked around to see which place had the best hot pastrami sandwich because well we just wanted one! So we stopped by Hershel's and ordered it. Short line, toasted up and prepared to perfection! Delicious pastrami but alas we could not finish the sandwich. Box it and doggy bag it for later! After being stuffed with enough food for 3 meals we decided it was time to finally leave. We still had some other places to eat like the Cajun spot and cheesesteak (line was long) but just couldn't fit any more food in our bellies!\n\n****THE GOOD****\n- Atmosphere. Nothing like it in Philly where you get everything under one roof. Market style so it's busy but that adds to the charm IMO.\n- Beiler's for donuts but the star here are the fritters. We had apple but I'm sure blueberry is good too.\n- Hershel's for good deli sandwich. We had only the hot pastrami which rivals any NY deli. I believe the owner is from NYC.\n- Sang Kee Duck was decent. Not the best and not bad. Come here if you need a Chinese food fix and roast pork and duck are pretty good.\n\n****THE BAD****\n- The lines can get long during lunch but it's worth the wait if you have the time.\n\n****THE UGLY***\n- Must have a bigger tummy for food!", "date": "2018-06-21 18:59:20"}

If there's one thing I love it's food halls and markets like this.

Not only were these visually appealing but the taste was beyond description. The best way to put it would be \"explosion of flavor\". They were just amazing. The lamb, the cucumber, tomatoes, feta, dressing - it all married perfectly. \n\nThere were several other booths to stop at but we were short on time. \n\nMy boyfriend and a friend of his went back a few weeks after and stopped at the donut place (when we were the line was incredibly long) and brought some back so I can attest that the long line is worth the wait. They were light, but dense and flavor packed. \n\nThis place is an absolute must!", "date": "2018-07-22 12:04:59"}

There was plenty of space for a dance floor and Molly Malloy's did a fantastic job with the drink service. We were so in love with the whole evening.

If I was local I would definitely come here to buy all my vegetables, meats, and cheeses! The grilled cheese booth looked particularly interesting as did the number of Pennsylvania Dutch booths in the market. I also noticed a single spot that serves as a bar, which is nice to have so your whole group can get drinks and then choose separately where you want to dine. The only purchase we made here was at Old City Coffee for my husband. They forgot his order so not a great experience.

The main area for sitting is pretty spacious, and gets full pretty quickly so send a scout ahead of you eating or be prepared to have a mobile meal.\n\nFOOD: \nThe food is amazing at several vendors in this Market, but my fav all time food to grab is Beilers the doughnuts are melt in your mouth good, they are freshly made right in front of you annnnnnd you can grab on in a batch that you see being made.\n\nWAITSTAFF: \nThere really isn't much in the way of waitstaff. There is a team that prepares the various foods and then those that are selling it to you. I haven't had more than a diner experience to yo, but it is expected so I just roll with it.  \n\nWHAT TO WEAR:\nThe crowd is pretty diverse and so are the clothing choices, or not. I have seen suits or blatant tourist gear in here. So I would say anything goes here.\n\nCROWD: \nThe crowd is massive from all walks of life it's like New York only indoors and less the constant yet surprising whiffs of pee every so often.\n\n*TIPS*:\nI would recommend that you not  drive to this location there really isn't a really viable place to park.

Lol!\n\nThere is a very long history about the Reading Terminal Market, as I read a brochure about this place.............let me share a little of what I read.\n\nApparently back in 1892 the Reading Railroad opened the Reading Terminal Market below the tracks of their massive new train shed. The 78,000 sq. foot market held nearly 800 spaces for vendors & was touted as the \"greatest food market\" in the world!\nBy 1971, the Reading Railroad went bankrupt & the Reading Terminal Market started to decline & be in disrepair. \nBeginning in the 1980's, the Reading Company renewed attention to the market & began a turnaround of the facilities, and by 1984 trains stopped running to the station above the market and the city's commuter rail system was re-routed to bypass the old Reading Terminal. \nBy 1990 the historic building was sold to the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority, who rebuilt the market to strict historic preservation standards, and also set up a non-profit management company to run the market and maintain the historical integrity of this place.\n\nI must say, if you're ever in Philadelphia, take sometime to check out the  Reading Terminal Market, as you should put it in your \"must\" list of things to do! \nVisiting the market has a lot of very cool historical value, as well coming here to try the various types of food...........it's basically a foodie lovers paradise!!!", "date": "2018-10-15 10:27:20"}

Many of Philadelphia's finest officers begin their days here with a hearty breakfast. I also love that the restaurants have come up with creative ways to serve breakfast like a cheesesteak breakfast, an oyster scramble breakfast. Love, love, love!\n\nI went to Molly Malloy's twice while visiting for breakfast. They have a wonderful avocado toast. Just when you think you had it with the boring same old avocado toast, Molly's will surprise you with their version topped with a fried egg over easy. The avocado is spiced wit pepper flakes and a dash of vinegar. Very very tasty and will keep you fulfilled for those long morning walks in the chilly weather. Service is great and attentive. \n\nI tried Pearl's oyster as well. Belly up to the diner and be greeted by the waitstaff. Did you say fried oysters for breakfast?  Yes, please!!! I had mine with egg white scramble. It was unusually delicious! \n\nTurnaround from Pearl's and you will see the Famous 4th Street Cookie Co. Get a cookie for the road.

Place is always packed with workers nearby grabbing a bite to eat and tourists. I warn you, it is really crowded here all the time. Here are some of the food stalls worth stopping for:\n\nBassetts Ice Cream -\nThe first merchant to sign a lease at the Reading Terminal Market in 1892. This place is still owned and run by the same family. With more than 40 flavors, you can have your pick. The cone comes with a generous scoop(s).\n\nBeiler's Bakery -\nOne of the best donuts. If this is your first time here, don't be deterred by the long line. You often hear people giving up when they see how long the line is. It moves pretty fast  and the best part, you get to see first hand how they make it in front of you. By the time you're midway through, grab a menu, choose your donuts so you don't hold up the line. My son who doesn't like sweets love Beilers'. Note: Not open on Sundays.\n\nFlying Monkey -\nThe owner with the love of the movie, \"The Wizard of Oz\", named her bakery Flying Monkey. When I first discovered this place, they were famous for their amazing cupcakes but nowadays, it's more on their award winning Whoopie pies. The Whoopie pies were named the best in the world and it comes in many flavors. Another must try is their Elvis cake. We usually buy a huge slice home. Every item is made from scratch.\n\nDutch Eating Place -\nThe only item we have tried here is their amazing warm apple dumpling with cinnamon which is served with a dollop of cool heavy cream. It is to die for.\n\nThe Original Turkey -\nI don't like eating turkey and the only turkey I will eat from is \"The Original Turkey\". You can see how juicy it is when they carve it right in front of you! Served with all your typical Thanksgiving fixings, you can have this all year round. You can also order it sandwich style. Don't forget to ask for extra gravy. \n\nBee Natural -\nI love to make my famous French toast at home. Instead of using syrup I prefer to use honey. I'm always pleased with the quality of their honey here. When I run low, I make sure to grab a bottle or two.\n\nThese are just a handful of stalls we frequent. The list goes on. There are also lots of counter lunch spots, food stalls and fresh produce. A must visit in the heart of Philly. \n\nIf you park at the Reading Terminal, you can get a discounted parking for $4 if you buy $10 and over at any one of the merchants at the Reading Terminal. Just have them validate your parking ticket. Remember, it is only good for 2 hours. Otherwise it will be $10 for 2 1/2 hours.", "date": "2018-12-02 23:14:17"}

The waterfall of emotion perfectly showcased reason #3162 why I can't have children - I certainly wouldn't make it through nine months of this kind of overreaction.\n\nBut, guys. Everything was just so damn beautiful.\n\nBy the end of my time in Philadelphia, I had eaten at 3/4 of the entire market. The stalls are plentiful but the aisles are cramped because I am clearly not the only person that appreciates the perfection that is Reading Terminal. I ate my weight in ice cream, I stood in line waiting for a subpar Philly cheesesteak whilst complaining in a faux New Jersey accent, I ... I may have even scarfed down a 4th street cookie while hiding in Jonathan Best's grocery so that when I emerged from the abyss I could pretend to be famished and hit up another stall. (If you ever ask me again whether or not this is true I will look you in the eye and swear on my grave it is not. I'd rather go die harboring a secret large enough to make me a Hogwarts ghost than shamefully admit on multiple occasions that I am enough of a fatass to eat two meals in the same hour in the same place.)\n\nThis is, by far, the best indoor food market I've ever visited. I still dream about Carmen's Franklin cheesesteak (they add cream cheese to it! Smart people) and I've recklessly attempted to recreate DiNic's iconic roast pork sandwiches at home. (Broccoli rabe is difficult to cook y'all.) I am currently attempting every which way into visiting Philadelphia again so I can skip and dance my way through this amazing food mecca. In the meantime, I will cry - because apparently I do that for everything.", "date": "2018-12-20 14:50:02"}

This time around, I broke the most essential cardinal rule:  'Come hungry.'  Indeed.  You see, a couple hours before, I'd stopped with hubby and kid at John's Roast Pork.  A meal I'd ultimately regret, but that's for another review.  Point is, I was still so f***ing full, the mere sight of all the food here made me feel a wee bit queasy.  I tried to power through, though. I really did:\n\nMiller's Twist:  I've eaten Pretzels from an Amish Market before, but not this particular one.  Happily, the classic Pretzel we chose did not disappoint. I have a secret (well, maybe not so much now) thing for Auntie Ann's Pretzels and this was an elevated, buttery, soft, warm version of that.  Even in my semi-nauseous state, that was clear.  We'd ordered some cheese sauce for dipping and both hubby and kid declared, \"This tastes just like butter and not in a good way!\" I'll concede they were right.  It was more fatty tasting than cheesy. I'd go with Mustard next time.\n\nSmucker's Grill:  Since I knew from previous disappointment that the Amish stands tend to close earlier than many of the others here, I'd made a point of looking up the hours.  According to the official Reading Terminal site, on Thursdays, this stand closes at 5pm.  So imagine my chagrin when we were told at 4:30 ish that they were no longer serving.  After explaining that the stated hours indicated otherwise, they were very accommodating about whipping up a Pot Roast Sandwich for us.  I asked them to add horseradish cheese, sauteed onion, and horseradish.  We wound up eating this after our two hour drive back home to Brooklyn and were shocked at how delicious it was!  I can only imagine how good this is freshly made and warm.  \n\nThis was all we could um... stomach on this visit...  But fwiw, have tried the famed donuts from Beiler's and while they're fun to experience once, I'd say there are way better ways to spend your dessert calories in Philly.  DiNic's on the other hand...  That Roast Pork Sandwich is worth everything.\n\nRandom Thoughts:  At 3pm, this place was bordering on annoyingly crowded, but by 4pm, it was downright pleasant.  This also happens to be when three hour street parking kicks in v. one hour. We were able to find a spot on N. 12th. Street, right near the entrance.   I believe there are also a couple nearby lots, including at the Hilton Garden Hotel, that with a validated minimum purchase, only charge a few bucks for two hours.\n\nBottom line:  If you don't like this Market, which is the soul of Philly in so many ways, then you're just not doing it right.  Go at a less crowded off time.  And since all the various options can feel overwhelming, read through some reviews to help narrow down your picks.  In this particular case, at least, Yelp is your friend.:)", "date": "2019-01-05 00:51:00"}

I've lived near and frequented many places like this: SF Ferry Terminal, Pike's Place in Seattle, Cleveland's West Side Market, Denver's The Source. This is like any of those, but with less diversity, dirtier, and with lower quality offerings. \n\nWe came on a Friday morning so the crowds were not terrible. The Lancaster vendors looked to have the tastiest things in the whole place, and they weren't so concerned with everything looking absolutely perfect, like so many other booths. To me, perfection is not appetizing, it just looks like cardboard. As other reviewers have said, the feel of the place as a whole was not clean. We saw a mouse run in front of us while browsing in the bulk/spice store. Sadly I do not think this is rare in the Philadelphia area, but I will not help normalize that poorly managed behavior by patronizing a dirty business. Needless to say we skedaddled.\n\nLast up, we went looking for produce. I had heard that this was one of the best \"farmers markets\" in the country. I think people who say that are confused. There were two produce vendors, one much larger than the other. One of them was offering disgusting, old, very VERY wilted leaf lettuces, a clue that they either don't understand their offerings or that they just don't care. The other had a much larger selection, but nothing unique. Bell peppers, citrus fruits, etc. Nothing you wouldn't find at a regular grocery store.\n\nI came to this place hoping for new and interesting.

If you're trying to get something specific though I would probably avoid going closer to closing (5 or 6PM) because they could run out of whatever you're going for. This place is just jam packed with people and for good reason! Most people have already done their research of places to hit up while visiting so if you haven't you'll know what you have to get by looking at the lines near these places.\nThe places that I have tried are Beiler's, Bassetts, Sang Kee, Shanghai Gourmet and Dinic's (of course). Haven't regretted anything here, so far! \n\nIt can get a little stressful trying to navigate through the aisles with hoards of people walking every which way.\nThey have a great selection of foods ranging from savory to sweet and from chinese food to Amish. I would probably just take cash here to be safe seeing as a lot of the stalls could be cash only or have a card minimum. There also isn't that much seating compared to the amount of people there are. If it's nice outside, looking for a park bench or eating outside somewhere isn't a bad idea, but for the colder or rainy times hovering around the tables looking for parties that are almost done may be your best option. Just keep in mind that there may be 3-5 other groups of people doing the same thing.\n\nAll in all, this is a great place to check out if you're in Philly either for the first time or revisting.

Whether you're a local or a visitor, this is one of those places you just have to stop in to at least once. Whether you want to actually grab a meal, just take a walk around to see what all they have, or are looking to stock up on vegetables, fruits, meats, breads, or sweets, this is a great place to go to. Besides the delicious food, they also have some wonderful stands set up to buy great souvenirs and gifts. \n\nNo matter what time of day you're visiting Reading Terminal, be prepared for a large crowd and lines. This is not the place to go to if you're crunched for time. I would recommend stopping in when you have time to spare. If this is your first time visiting, my other recommendation is to walk around the entire premise to see what all there is before you make any purchases. There are ample food options so it's nice to see what all they have to offer before making your decision. Just a few places that stand out to me include Meltkraft, Tommy DiNic's, Beiler's Bakery, Famous 4th Street Cookie Company, and Termini Bros Bakery. :)\n\nIf you're in or near Philadelphia, be sure to put Reading Terminal on your list of places to go to so you can take in just some of the greatness our city has to offer.

There is everything from Gourmet Meats cheeses and seafood and produce to ready to eat treats as well. There's communal sitting areas where you can all get your favorite things to eat from the different stands and eat together in the same spot. For sure this is a foodie spot. They even have live music. Checkout Kamal' for their delicious Rose mint lemonade. Sang Lee Peking duck house is the spot for some tasty and cheap Peking Duck and roast pork.. then hit dinic's for a roast pork sandwich but hold the greens. Carmen cheesesteak is Juicy and amazing. I mean there's a line. Stand on it and wait. There's also a place called meltkraft the most amazing cheese ever. I mean there's so many different combinations of grilled cheese is crazy. Unfortunately I wasn't able to shove everything in my mouth in that whole Market but fortunately I did have some friends with me but I was able to buy a bunch of stuff and we all shared it which is the way to go.

All of these were good. My taste test (albeit of different types of cookies) leads me to give a slight nod to 4th Street's macadamia chocolate chip cookie (the healthier looking Harvest cookie - cranberries, oats, cinnamon - at Hope's was actually kind of greasy). That said I like the selection at Hope's as well as their signature peanut butter chocolate dipped cookies. \nMy one disappointing experience with RTM was the Dutch Eating Place's open face turkey sandwich. Not sure how this got positive reviews - the plain white bread was drowned in gravy that coated excessive turkey - so much unappetizing food!

I had a couple of restaurants in my list : one for Scrapple and the other for roast pork sandwich. I was lucky to try them both. Scrapple is a local Philly food made of all the scraps of a pig. It does not sound enticing but when cooked right it's extremely delicious. I had scrapple from Down Home Diner. This place is pretty crowded. I waited in line for 15 mins to get seated. I finally got my scrapple after 30 mins wait. Although people like it with maple syrup I personally prefer the ketchup. Roast pork sandwich at Dinic's sandwich place was really good too. \n\nReading market is insanely huge. Walking around all these local restaurants can be overwhelming. They have almost every cuisine that you can imagine. I also found something that I actually wasn't looking for. Egg puffs at the Indian restaurant made my day. It's our local Indian savory food and it had been over 3 years since I had a egg puff. I was over the moon when I found it here. \n\nI definitely recommend you to go through the list of restaurants that are at this market because it's just a lot to go there and decide where you want to dine. \n\nFor the unlucky ones who planned to visit this place on a Easter Sunday, I feel bad for them as the market was closed.", "date": "2019-04-23 14:50:25"}

The market has a wide variety of ethic products, Pennsylvania dutch products, homemade soaps, local spirits, locally sourced produce and meats, international and domestic cheeses, exquisite chocolates, and much much more.  \n\nI am obsessed with Downtown Cheese, a shop offering an overwhelming selection of cheeses and cold cuts from all over the globe.

I've been here numerous times over the years and I have yet to be disappointed. Don't miss the Amish Bakery, Beiler's, where at least the very least, you will experience some of the best PA Dutch home-style food in all of Pennsylvania!  I never visit Philly without taking advantage of an opportunity to snag a few Harvest Apple donuts from Beiler's! Best donut I've ever tasted!\n\nMy second favorite spot at RTM's has to be \"The Original Turkey\". It's like having Thanksgiving dinner every day! There are so many choices, you won't go home hungry! \n\nIf you get a chance to buy a ticket to \"Taste of Philly\", you'll get your fill of cheese-steak, donuts, crepes, ethnic foods from all over the world, as well as some of the best desserts and confections to be found in the massive state of Pennsylvania!", "date": "2019-08-20 22:37:26"}

But a little different in which all food vendors are inside, in an air conditioned place (which is a nice way to stay cool during the summer months). \n\nAlthough there are tables and chairs, I feel that there just isn't enough, especially if you come during peak time. My husband and I came on a Thursday, right before noon and as the time progressed, it was getting busier and busier. \n\nOne major negative that I would have to say about this food market is that they close early, at 6 pm every day. If only they stayed open later so that you could grab a later dinner. But now that you know this, just make sure to plan your visit accordingly so that you don't miss out if you are visiting Philly for the first time. \n\nPlease note that a lot of the vendors here do take credit card and there are clean restrooms available.", "date": "2019-08-21 00:24:22"}

That's a lot. It's easily one of the most-reviewed places I've visited. It's one of those popular \"public\" markets with a food hall and a bevy of vendors selling everything from fresh produce and flowers to handmade crafts and jewelry. A lot of big cities have them. Comparable markets include Chelsea Market in New York, the Ferry Building in San Francisco, and Pike Place Market in Seattle. In Atlanta, where I'm from, Reading Terminal Market (\"RTM\") reminds me most of Sweet Auburn Curb Market. New developments have popped up around the country in recent years that try to emulate a sort of old-school municipal market feel.\n\nRTM is different because, unlike its newer counterparts, its atmosphere is genuine and not manufactured. The market opened in 1893, making it one of the country's oldest. Some of the market's vendors have been around since the very beginning, over 100 years, like Bassetts Ice Cream. You can find them just inside one of the 12th Street entrances on the west side of the market. This is where we entered.\n\nThis is a Philadelphia hot spot and one of the most recommended places for out-of-towners to go. We visited over the weekend and the market was crowded with tourists and locals alike. It should definitely be high on any foodie's Philly to-do list. There are so many food stalls here and the selection is eclectic, from Amish-style rotisserie chicken, sourced regionally, from Dienner's Bar-B-Q Chicken to Peking duck from Sang Kee Peking Duck (an RTM outpost of a Philly Chinatown favorite).\n\nIn all, there are over 80 vendors packed onto one floor. They're classified into the following categories: bakeries, beverages, dairy & cheese; housewares, books, crafts, etc; meats & poultry, Pennsylvania Dutch (note the PA Dutch vendors are closed every Sunday), produce, restaurants, seafood, and specialty foods. The market is laid out in a grid with four large aisles going north-south, and 11 smaller aisles going east-west. There are a handful of communal seating areas (almost all seats were taken during our visit), restrooms (clean enough), and an attended welcome booth if you'd like to pick up a map and/or ask for recommendations. Some of the vendors also have their own dedicated seating.\n\nA few recommendations:\n\n1. Roast pork sandwich at Tommy DiNic's Pork & Beef. Perhaps the most popular vendor here. They offer wraparound counter service.\n\n2. Pretzel from Miller's Twist. These are fresh-made, Amish-style pretzels. They're also known for their cheddar-jalapeno pretzel dog and breakfast foods. (Note: Miller's Twist is a PA Dutch vendor and is closed on Sundays.)\n\n3. Scrapple from Down Home Diner. Also known as Pannhaas by the PA Dutch, this is basically pork scraps made into a savory pate. Reminds me of the Neese's liver pudding (livermush) I ate growing up in North Carolina.\n\nSurprisingly, there's not really a well-known or recommended vendor for cheesesteaks here though there are some who sell them (e.g. Carmen's Famous Italian Hoagies & Cheesesteaks). Bring cash because some vendors, like Carmen's, are cash-only. A couple places that caught our eye that we didn't get to try were Pearl's Oyster Bar and Mueller Chocolate Co. (featured on Food Network).\n\nThere are two parking garages, one at 12th and Filbert (Parkway Garage) and the other at 11th and Arch (Hilton Garage). Signs posted at each entrance to the market advertised 2-hour discount parking with $10 market purchase and validation at the vendor.\n\nIf you're pressed for time in Philly, Reading Terminal Market is a great place to visit since there are so many vendors all in one place. If you're from out of town, be sure to visit the northwest corner of the market where all the PA Dutch vendors are located. They're unique.", "date": "2019-08-27 14:01:35"}

I got a fruity pebbles donut which was amazeballs. My favorite ice cream place is there and I got a salted caramel pretzel ice cream  delicious !! Def.

Reading Terminal Market is an indoor market (perfect for a rainy day) and has many places to visit, eat and shop at.  The Market features bakeries (as pictured below), a mini meat and cheese market, a small scaled market that sells a variety of pastas, canned and dried fruits,  a whole produce section with fresh flowers, vegetables and fruits, a gigantic food court (I recommend getting the raspberry banana smoothie at the juice bar yum), and specialty stores too that are from around the world like the Holland shop (all items are designed and made in Holland) and feature some of the most beautiful ornaments and kitchen items I have ever seen!  And not to mention to satisfy your sweet tooth, there are many places to buy fudge, chocolate, cake slices and cupcakes too (oh my goodness)!

It reminds me of a similar place we have in LA called \"The Farmers Market\".  It is an indoor, covered collection of mostly eateries and some stalls that sell gifts and other items.  I think you can pretty much find anything you want to eat here, from every type of cuisine, to dessert, to a smoothie, etc.  They also have a market where you can buy fresh produce and some groceries, as well as several meat markets, delis, and more.  I was honestly overwhelmed with the selection here.  Since I came here after eating lunch, I only grabbed a juice to sip on, but they also have many vendors that provide samples of their dishes.

Also stopped by Termini Bros. and got some freshly filled cannolis! \n\nReading Terminal is def a great stop if you're going to Philly!

Being from Florida, we don't have anything close to this. When I'm in town I always make it a point to stay at a hotel that is right across the street from here lol. \n\nIt's a large market and there is plenty of space to move around even when it's crowded. They literally have anything and everything that you could want here. \n\nThere are butchers, restaurants, produce stores, a chocolate store and so much more. Not to mention this is where Bassett's the oldest ice cream shop in the country is located. You have to stop there and get an ice cream, no excuses lol.\n\nThere are two places here that I hit up religiously. The first one being Dinic's for a roast pork sandwich. Omg it is so fucking good. There is nothing else like it. Their other sammies look great as well, but I never deviate from the roast pork.\n\nThe second spot that is a must is Beiler's bakery located in the corner. It's a Pennsylvania Dutch bakery and it's fucking unreal. You can watch them make everything from scratch throughout the day. There is always a long line, but it moves quick. I'd say their bagels are better than the ones that you get in New Yuck. The star of the show here though are their Amish pies and their doughnuts. My favorite doughnut they have is the Apple fritter. If you're lucky enough to get one fresh out of the oven, you'll never be able to eat another fritter from anywhere else lol. \n\nAll in all, Reading Terminal Market is a great spot that has anything that you, or your group would want to eat. That's the beauty here, there isn't a reason to argue over where to eat. Everyone can do their own thing and be happy.

This type of market is very common in Europe, but not so much in the US. It is very well located, equidistant from Independence Hall and Rittenhouse. Unlike some reviewers, I have not really found Reading Market to be oppressively crowded...rather, it is vibrant and lively, but there is plenty of opportunity to eat what you want and to buy what you want.

You can ask for samples of the fudge, which are made with real cream and butter!\n\nOld City Coffee: Great place to grab coffee, they can also make your coffee fancy as they have a variety of syrups! They do sell coffee beans which you can take home.\n\nBassetts Ice Cream: This place has such amazing ice cream- I tried the strawberry which tasted like real fruit.

Its worth it to drive down lol!\n\nSince we arent locals, the produce isnt that big for us, but we love getting spices and seasonings from the Head Nut and the Herbiary.\n\nWe also love getting unique items from Amys place!  Highly recommend!\n\nThey also have several butchers that you can get fresh meats from.  We really love getting sausages and so many other items like steaks and sometimes fish.  Dont forget a cooler!\n\nThey also have about 10 stores that are direct from Lancaster Amish country!    Fresh butter, fresh eggs, fresh produce!

There's also common food court seating, although it was mostly full when I was there.\n\nIt could be chaos, but it's actually laid out pretty well, with a number of entrances, and enough division between establishments that it doesn't feel like a street market.\n\nI sampled from 4-5 places (that's all my stomach could take). ALL were decent, and honestly surprisingly well-priced for the city center of a major metropolis. If I lived or worked nearby, I'd be in here regularly.\n\nThere's also one or more places offering a butcher, fishmonger, florists, produce, and a variety of knicknacks and home goods. It's a complete market, and that's though I probably missed a quarter of what was on offer.\n\nAt this point (June 2021) the majority of the market was open but masks were required inside. A handful of empty or vacated spots implied places that didn't make it... but the vast majority of the place was not just operating, but bustling.\n\nThere's one sour spot-- closing time is 6pm (when I was there), which is awfully early for the dinner or commuter crowd. I don't know if that's normal here, or a covid effect.\n\nAll of that deliciousness is housed in a historic structure with easy access from the city and tourist destinations.

To be certain, Reading Terminal attracts its fair share of out-of-towners like us, but unlike Quincy Market there's still a sense that it's a place where locals come.

Cannoli, poutine, a big ol' freshly baked biscuit with jam, fresh fruit from the grocer, a pastry called a pig ear, and much more - all of it was good.

I enjoy the history, the variety of shoppes, and the whole atmosphere of this marketplace. I can see why Reading Terminal Market has been in business for so long. Some of my favourite spots here are the tea shoppe, the beeswax candle shoppe, the General Store, the Mushroom shoppe, and Flying Monkey for their gluten free options. As a New Yorker I come here to stock up on items I cannot find near me, and it's also significantly more affordable. \n\nMy only advice is to not visit during the Philadelphia Flower Show, because that's when the Market gets mobbed with tourists! This is especially true about the Donut Shoppe-my first visit to the Flower Show back in 2015, and my first trip to Philly. All I wanted to do was explore the Market, but there was a long line, a good kilometer (0.6 mile), wrapped around the outside of the building! Why? 'Cuz tourists wanted those famous donuts, that's why! XD:   But that's good for business so I'm not complaining 'bout that!\n\nMy only complaint is that (like many places in Center City Philadelphia) it closes too early (at 18:00 or 6pm) most days of the week (based on memory).  Otherwise I enjoy visiting and shopping in what feels like my eccentric Amish grandmother's farm stand.", "date": "2021-07-27 22:31:49"}

My boyfriend got food from Franks a lot which was also pretty underwhelming with a really slow moving line.

The glowing reviews for this place never fail to make me shake my head in bewilderment. As far as I'm concerned, this place is the Pennsylvania version of the Pennsauken Mart and my private version of a house of horrors. \n\nWhen I was a pre-schooler, my grandmother would drag me here to shop. The place smelled bad, like a combination of rotting meat and decaying vegetables. As soon as we'd arrive, I'd start to cry and squirm. No amount of my Nan threatening me with the leather belt she always carried in her purse to mete out instant punishment would reset my behavior to quiet and compliant. I wasn't a horrible, temperamental boy in general but going to RTM pushed every one of my buttons. As a shy, nervous kid, being in a big, moving crowd of people frightened me, but I was too young to express my feelings and fears, and even if I'd been able to do so, my grandparents were no nonsense immigrants who did not tolerate or pander to childish folderol. After many dreadful shopping trips with me crying, screaming, trying to run away and generally creating a scene, my grandmother began to go here on her own and leave me at home-in peace.\n\nWhen I was a high schooler, sometimes friends would want to go here on a Saturday to just walk around, people watch and then get something to eat. By then, I was too big to cry and make a fuss, so I'd simply go off on my own and meet them elsewhere. Years later, I was a loner in art college and the few people I did hang out with were not the types to find RTM a 'fun' place to spend free time.\n\nFlipping the calendar pages forward to when I moved back to Philadelphia a bit more than half a decade ago, I was simply awed by all the changes in the city, the new skyline and what was suddenly a vast wonderland of places to eat. I'd heard about Melt Kraft (RIP), which was THE place for grilled cheese sandwiches. Unfortunately the stumbling block for me was its location-Reading Terminal Market. My late friend Dee offered to go with me to help me work through my childhood associations with the market. I readily accepted because-anything for a good grilled cheese sandwich, y'know? \n\nWe went on a Sunday. The insidious smell of rot and vegetal decay hit me as soon as I walked in, but it was not as intense as I'd remembered. The press of the crowd was, though. Dee got directions to Melt Kraft, we pushed and shoved through slow moving bodies in winter clothing and found the vendor. And a very long line of people who also shared my love of gooey, hot cheese. I said I would skip the sandwich but if she was up for it, we'd walk around. \n\nSince I don't like donuts, roast pork sandwiches, cheesesteaks, hoagies or looking at meat and dead fish, I don't drink coffee nor do I care for pancakes or iterations of waffles, that left a lot of places for us to just pass by and skip. I am acutely aware that I am a neurotic person, so I asked Dee if RTM was as dirty and unpleasant as I perceived it to be. She said she honestly felt it was fairly clean for a market of this kind, but she understood my feelings. We made it to Iovine's produce which oddly calmed and soothed me, but not enough for me to spend any more time there. \n\nEven if I was forced to entertain out of towners that I absolutely loathed, I wouldn't torture them by taking them here.\n\nMy travels have taken me to the Casbah in Morocco, public markets in Africa, butcher shops and green grocers all over Europe. I adore Chinatown and the whole Italian Market area. I can spend hours in either place walking around, eating, drinking and shopping. To me, Reading Terminal Market is nothing but a huge, smelly, crowded tourist attraction, a so-so sub par food circus and a place for me to avoid. This is, of course, simply my opinion and your mileage may vary. More power to you if it does. \n\nIf you are a visitor to Philadelphia, please keep in mind that we are much much much more than RTM, the Phillies baseball team, soft pretzels, cheesesteaks, the Liberty Bell and the \"Rocky Steps\" (which are merely part of the building and lead to one of the entrances to the Philadelphia Museum of Art).", "date": "2021-11-27 15:58:26"}

The vibe is always great.\n\nWe love the Thai Salmon dish, the cannoli's and the farmers market for fresh meats/produce. \n\nI live in NJ so I normally travel to Center City by train, so it becomes quite the adventurous day for us.", "date": "2022-01-14 14:37:34"}

It's old school, crowded, and wonderful. So many types of stalls, stands,  restaurants and bakeries. My favorites are the Cajun restaurant, the mushroom stand, and the butchers.
