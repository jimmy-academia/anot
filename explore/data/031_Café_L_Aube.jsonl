Yet, like others have said, I almost hate to write such a glowing review because I might not get a seat next time I go.\n\nIt's on an odd block between ritzy Rittenhouse and patchy Graduate Hospital, a strip where cheap nail places and cheaper greasy spoons rub uneasily against farm to table foodie meccas and gastropubs. It doesn't look like much from outside, but inside it's a slice of what's best about Euro cafes. I had a cafe au lait and the Classique crepe. Amazing. It was like being back in Paris without the B.O. The crepe is perfect and the fillings top notch with none of the overstuffed crassness that's become so commonplace. The cheese and ham and mushrooms were just enough for all to shine and yet take nothing away from the perfect buckwheat crepe that can only be managed with more practice than I will ever get. \n\nYou'll spend at least $10 for a drink and a crepe, but it's worth it. Anyway, isn't Starbucks getting up there anyway? And it will never manage food like this. \n\nThe walls are painted in cheery, bright hues that light up the narrow cafe. There's WiFi but I didn't use it. I couldn't bring myself to do it. I read an old fashioned paper and ink magazine and enjoyed the moment. It's a hike across town for me, but I'll be back.

There was plenty of parking (free on Sunday! yay!) nearby, which is a huge plus. Despite the small size of the place, it wasn't crowded at all.

They were perfect looking! Slightly crispy on the outside, with that beautiful lace-like caramelized pattern, and soft on the inside. Unlike most crepes here in the US, these were NOT filled with insane amounts of filling such that you can't taste the crepe itself. My friend's comment about his salmon & spinach crepe: the salmon was fresh it was emotionally touching. The veggie sandwich also looked very fresh and perfect for summer. \n\nThe only reason I knocked a star off was because of the coffee, which was too bitter for my taste. But it's not the type of over-extraction bitterness you get from Starbucks, this was bitterness from deep roasted coffee, so more of a personal taste issue than misstep. \n\nService was very friendly, not overly attentive, nor ignorant.

The boss. The health code violations. The pretension of it in general. \n\nI have been here a few times and each time have been greeted with sarcasm, condescension and overall rudeness. The employees for the most part have been okay, but the owner is not friendly. Furthermore, while on a trip to the bathroom one day, I saw that the \"sinks\" they wash their dishes in are not set up according to health code. You are meant to have a sink full of hot water, a sink full of the blue water with tablets to sanitize and then a sink to rinse. All they do is use soap and old sponges, etc. to \"clean\" their dishes.\n\nSomeone should report them.", "date": "2010-06-04 04:30:41", "user": {"name": "Sarah", "review_count": 1, "yelping_since": "2010-06-04 04:26:26", "elite": "", "average_stars": 1.0, "fans": 0}}

I say \"Parisian-influenced\" because the atmosphere isn't evocative of a Parisian cafe, but the flavors certainly are. It's easy to miss, but follow the sound of French music and you'll find Cafe L'Aube.\n\nOne of my favorites on the menu is the Breton, a toasty, buttery baguette with brie, apple, honey, almonds, and coconut. As fantastic as it sounds. The coffee doesn't disappoint either, it tastes like a medium roast, but strong and full-bodied. Jean-Luc and crew are friendly and happy to make suggestions from the menu, which is surprisingly large for a small cafe. \n\nWhen I want to avoid the crowd and decibels of some of the hipper cafes, or I want to get some reading or work done, Cafe L'Aube is one of my top choices. You won't feel like you're in Paris at Cafe L'Aube, but it'll taste like you are.", "date": "2010-05-10 14:49:35", "user": {"name": "Jason", "review_count": 47, "yelping_since": "2010-05-08 14:45:21", "elite": "2010,2011", "average_stars": 3.82, "fans": 13}}

They have a nice broad menu of sandwiches and sweet or savory crepes. I went with the Croque Monsieur Vegetarian, and was entirely satisfied: melted mozzarella, fresh avocado and a generous amount of basil on golden toast. I don't usually go for white sandwich bread, but this one was slightly herbed or something, and seemed just the right thing. Crispy, warm, and well-balanced. Came with a small mixed green salad , a tiny pitcher of balsamic on the side. Very fresh. Again, just right. I was there for the eats, and am not a coffee connoisseur, so cannot speak to the beverage selection.  \n\nWas about $8 for sandwich + salad. Pretty standard for the neighborhood.
