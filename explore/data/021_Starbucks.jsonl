In 2017, are we really denying pregnant women access to public restrooms? And at a Starbucks no less?\n\nMy wife is 30 weeks pregnant and was seeking relief after a fair amount of eating, drinking, and walking along South Street.\n\nShe walked into the Starbucks at around 8:00pm and asked for a venti cup of ice water and the restroom key. The barista (a white male) told her restrooms were for paying customers only. She showed her belly and explained that being pregnant she really needed to use the restroom and he told her there was nothing he could do because it was store policy.\n\nMy wife walked out visibly shaken and told me what happened. I walked in with her and asked for clarification about the store policy. I've never known any other Starbucks to do this. I was told by the same barista that there was nothing they could do and they reiterated the store policy, saying it was a \"Philly Starbucks policy\".\n\nI told them that was ridiculous and asked if corporate was aware. Another employee (a white female) stepped up and told me that the reason they have this policy in place is because it is a \"safety issue\". My wife and I looked at her perplexed, so she continued explaining, saying that they let people use the bathroom and they end up shooting heroin and there's been an uptick in crime.\n\nThis made me livid... I asked if she really thinks my pregnant wife is coming in their bathroom to shoot heroin and she just kept repeating it's a safety issue.\n\nFed up, I said that I would be calling corporate to complain. She laughed and said I could go ahead and call corporate because they are the ones who made the policy and give them direction. I asked her for her name and she said she was not required to give it to me. I asked the other two employees and they also refused to give me their name saying they are not required to do so.\n\nFrustrated, I said, that I would take a venti Cafe mocha and the restroom key. I figured policy aside, my wife needed to use the bathroom so I'll just buy something. The female employee said that she is choosing to refuse me service and that I need to leave the store or she would call the police.\n\nShocked by her brash reactions and the fact that the other two staff seemed to think this entire exchange was funny, I said this whole thing was crazy and headed out the door. As I was walking out, the female employee cursed at me saying, \"have a great f'ing day\". I walked back in and asked what she said and she kept threatening to call the police if I didn't leave. I took out my phone and snapped a picture of them (see attached).\n\nI called corporate to complain about the situation and they indicated they would follow up with me. \n\nAll in all, I am incredibly disappointed in this particular location and the workers here. They were rude, condescending, and took every opportunity to insult and demean us. And given that the three employees and the few customers in the store at the time were all white and we are black, l can't help but conclude that race played a factor here.\n\nWe spend entirely too much money on a daily basis at Starbucks to warrant this kind of treatment. And given their location on South Street (which gets busy at times), I can understand a customers-only policy, but they should consider expanding that to pregnant women and also people who are regular Starbucks customers. They should also evaluate individual circumstances and make informed, solutions-oriented decisions. \n\nVery disappointed.

A number so sinister that it has hellacious written all over it. When you reach this milestone on Yelp you clearly have to write about something that represents your idea of hell (or Johnny Brenda's if your Dave H. -1- but he's still the man). So it sounds like the perfect time to sum up exactly how I feel about Starbucks. And since I already spelled it out for you many moons over (http://www.yelp.com/list/i-hate-starbucks-philadelphia) you know exactly where this one is going.\n\nMy overall thoughts of Starbucks has nothing to do with service or product. I've had decent service in plenty, and in spots like the one that I'm dropping this review on (you'll go anywhere if certain people suggest it) I've had better than decent. And you can't go wrong with the diverse selections of beans that they bring in, assortment of Tazo teas, and delicious treats that they offer for the most part. Although a lot of the prices can be pretty damn horrendous (there's good reason why I affectionately call them Fourbucks). And they do provide a spacious decor that gives you plenty of room to get some work done if your in a bind (I like the upstairs that this one offers).\n\nBut in the land of lush and vibrant indie coffeehouses that is Philadelphia, Starbucks is pretty much the Soulless Empire. When you walk into a place like Chapterhouse that turns it's surroundings into an art gallery; a spot like Last Drop that's packed to the gills with good music, listings for local shows, and gratuitous people watching; or a spot like TBar that hooks up Scrabble and an amazing book exchange; the atmosphere brings you to life. But by comparison the atmosphere of Starbucks manages to suck the life right out of you. Every time I walk in and see the same typical looking art, the same cold plain decor, and total lack of vibrance, I can't help but feel like a corporate slave digging a hole towards a corporate grave no matter what I'm doing. If you ever hear the words \"Grande soy latte two sugars\" coming out of my mouth feel free to slay me.\n\nBut the main reason I hate Starbucks is because, just like rats in the city, they're freaking EVERYWHERE. If you walk down any major Philly street and see a Starbucks, and then it's more than likely that you'll come across another three blocks away, and then ANOTHER! It borders on the unnecessary, but rather than do something to lessen the amount (even when Starbucks announced the closing locations) it feels like their building more (http://www.yelp.com/biz/macys-philadelphia#hrid:6dm686CWJQrzhJAfGOcEwQ). Damn the Empire!\n\n-1- Dave H. did review Johnny Brenda's as his 666. But it wasn't because he found it evil.
