Got to chatting with the friendly proprietor and found myself wishing my neighborhood had a corner shop like this. Warm and engaging gets me every single time. Plus I really love me some salt of the earth Philly-style charm.\n\nWas thrilled to come across a big flat round loaf of airy, crusty bread to bring back home to make muffalettas. And the mini sfogliatelle that inspired my visit were revived beautifully after a few minutes in a 350 F oven.\n\nNoticed that they carry Irish products, too, and when I asked about it, was told something to the effect of, \"We believe in offering everything that's delicious. It doesn't have have to be Italian.\" With that in mind, this is also a great resource, should you want to track down Soom Tahini, made famous by Philly Zahav Chef, Michael Solomonov.\n\nOn the evening I stopped by, I was already in a semi food coma, courtesy of a roast pork and broccoli raab sandwich from DiNic's.
