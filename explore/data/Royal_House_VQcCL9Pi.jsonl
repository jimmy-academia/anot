After going for a quick jog in the morning, I was hungry and ready to enjoy some delicious New Orleans food. \n\nThere was no wait on a Saturday morning - unlike Petunias down the street (which is totally not worth the wait...I'll explain in my review later). The host was super friendly. The food arrived quickly. It was decently priced (approx. $11). And, the food tasted awesome! I'm a benedict lover, and this crawfish benedict was one of the best benedicts I've had! It was served with this creamy shrimp sauce - not hollandaise. This was a nice, unique touch. The crawfish was fresh - obviously! The side of cajun potatoes were also delish. \n\nI highly recommend this place before it becomes crazy touristy ;-)", "date": "2009-03-31 02:25:24"}

We had made the walk down, scored some brewskies & were back out on the street (man, Atlanta's really gotta get an area like this) hunting for some dinner, 'cause the drinking wasn't going to get far, on empty stomachs. After checking out a few side streets from Bourbon, we came down to Royal, and saw the Royal House Oyster Bar; unlike a lot of the joints we had ambled past, this place neither had a line running down the street, nor was it deserted, which never bodes well for the food within. \n\nWe were waved in by a friendly ma\u00eetre d' who welcomed both us and the milk-pail-sized beers in our mitts (again, just gotta love this town), and were taken right back to a table by the bar, with a window for people watching. My coworker went for the \"Taste of New Orleans\", which is a single plate featuring the 'holy trinity' of Louisiana cuisine, Jambalaya, Etoufee & Gumbo. All three looked pretty good, and came together to make up a pretty heavy-portioned plate of food. \n\nI figured, I'm in an oyster bar, heck, why not be different & go for the oysters? I love Oysters Rockefeller, and a half dozen of those got penciled in first, on my wish list. I completed my order with the Oysters Royale, & stuck with the tub of malted goodness I had brought in with me. The kitchen must have been pretty well stacked, staff-wise, because the food came out pretty quickly.\n\n I soon had two rock-salt-laden platters groaning under the weight of the most monstrously-mounded oyster-goodness concoctions I've ever seen. These things were piled high, folks. If you're the type who likes to get a dainty niblet of oyster with every mini-forkful of dressing, you're going to need really good knife skills. Otherwise, you're going to have to gnosh your way down to where the bivalve resides. The dressings were light & moist on the inside, a testament to delicate handling on the part of the cooks. They were baked off to delectable perfection.  The Oysters Royale struck me as a little bland, but that could perhaps be due to being enjoyed alongside the Oysters Rockefeller, which were packed with flavor. \n\nA side note on the Rockefellers here; they're a good deal spicier than I've had anywhere else before. I chalked that up to being in New Orleans, and still enjoyed them immensely, but if you're capsaicin-averse, you might want to consider some of the other offerings...or order a glass of milk. My dinner ended up consisting entirely of the dozen oysters, but even after handing over two for sampling purposes, I departed as stuffed as the oysters had been. Bravo, Royal House, may you enjoy a long run in the French Quarter, for I shall be back. Merci Bien.", "date": "2009-08-11 21:19:33"}

My mom had the bread pudding (topped with white chocolate sauce) and I had the banana foster cheesecake.  I wish I had saved the calories for the banana foster french toast I ate the next morning...it was the only part of the meal I didn't drool over.\n\nOverall, Royal House Oyster Bar is a cozy and casual restaurant that could be very romantic if you weren't there with your mom.

The bartender said she'd give me a free drink on the house.  So I point to a bottle of red wine against the wall behind her.

How did I end up in this predicament? I did my research before this trip and none of the eateries I bookmarked were in the quarter. I needed to get off Bourbon street quickly before the obnoxious drunken zombie tourists got me! I also didn't want to succumb to desperation and jump into any sub par restaurant/tourist trap. Thank goodness for my iPhone and the Yelp app which directed me one block over on Royal Street to the Royal House Oyster bar. We were seated quickly and had our orders taken in no time. I knew I was safe from douchebaggary when our waiter started quoting Bob Dylan and, subsequently, the three of us got into a lengthy discussion about our favorite Dylan albums. I had a mighty good shrimp po-boy and my boyfriend had a trio plate consisting of small portions of gumbo, jambalaya, and ettoufee. We started off with some delicious amazing craw-cakes covered with little shrimp and crawfish sauce. It all sounds very touristy-typical but the quality of food was there, plus the pricing was very reasonably spot-on. On top of all that, the bartender ain't no joke and whips up some great cocktails. Should you find yourself in the same situation as me, just walk one block over and trust in this place. We keep talking about how good the food was and will surely return on future visits to New Orleans.", "date": "2011-02-04 20:00:11"}

Little did I know that it would turn into a dining experience that should have been included in one of Dante's rings of hell.\n\nIt was very busy so I was seated at the oyster bar at about 7:45 p.m. 20 minutes go by and people all around me (including customers who arrive considerably after me) are getting drinks and food and I don't even get a menu. I flag down one of the people who look like they're in charge to tell them I have not been helped and have not even gotten a menu; he apologizes and tells me that my dinner will be comped.\n\nMeanwhile at the bar, Kenny, who's apparently the head shucker and the only shucker authorized to take dining orders, finally takes my order. I order what I would have with the certificate anyway: a cup of seafood gumbo and the crawfish platter. He repeats it thrice to make sure he has it right and I confirm it three times. I get the gumbo in about 10 minutes and it was pretty good with sausage, crawfish, and crab that had simmered down to small threads, then nothing. \n\nI am there for another hour and fifteen minutes before getting the crawfish platter. Kenny doesn't realize this even though he's the one who supposed to have put in the order. He has a shucker go out for a break, never to return. I had to ask 5 times about the platter and never got a straight answer. At 15-minute intervals, I kept being told by waitresses that \"it will be right out in 5 minutes.\" As the interminable wait for the entree continued. I order a beer. I was nursing the beer and finished most of two beers before the crawfish platter finally arrived with crawfish cakes, fried crawfish, and crawfish etoufee.\n\nI was so hungry and angry that the entree tasted like cardboard to me. Apologies and lack of responsibility by the staff don't make up for that 3 hour dining disaster in my life I'll never get back. Blaming the entree tardiness on the shucker who walked out is unprofessional and wrong. It may have contributed to this but was not the cause of the problem. This is not a leisurely hours-long dining kind of place. When a business can't get it right, they should make it right and not screw it up worse by not fixing the problem and lying and making excuses on top of it. The only good part of the meal experience was the bread pudding. Afterwards, Kenny had the cajones to say that he hoped I would return to Royal House. And re-live a horrible memory? Hell no!", "date": "2011-02-20 13:49:45"}

When we tried to place an order for a drink, he sent us to the other end of the bar putting us squarely in the way of every waiter and waitress trying to get by with a tray. Nice. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, the service was painfully slow. Everyone at the table got their meal except for me; like 20 minutes of waiting without a plate. It was just as well, since everyone who was picking at their food said it was freezing like it was sitting on the counter forever. Gummy cold fries, etc. \n\nWhen my meal finally came out, it was a shrimp po boy (not the oyster one I ordered) but I was too starving to care. I plowed through it even though the shrimp was cold and had obviously been out of the fryer for a while. \n\nOur waitress was missing for very long intervals so it was nearly impossible to place a drink order. It looked like they had her working two sections and the other one was down a long flight of stairs, so I don't blame her for their inability to properly staff the restaurant and cook food for a large party while still keeping it hot. We ordered *sandwiches* for pete's sake. Even if you're slammed, you should be able to bring out sandwiches and hot fries in under 2 hours. \n\nNot only was nothing comped, (and I NEVER ask for that sort of thing, but somewhat expect a place to extend an olive branch if the service or food was an embarrassment)  we were considerably OVERcharged and had to send the bill back to be corrected. \n\nAn all around disappointment. \n\nThe manager stopped by and everyone mentioned the cold fries so he brought out some plates of hot ones, but this was one of the least satisfying meals we had in New Orleans.", "date": "2011-02-25 01:36:27"}

The Oyster trio was DELICIOUS We ended up only getting Oyster Rockefeller and some sort of seafood stuffed oyster. The Rockefeller was the highlight.. the other not so much. It was supposed to come with a third kind of Oyster.. but the said they were out of them.. which is weird since it's just oysters with a different seasoning on top.\n\nMoving on.. the rest of the food except for the crab bisque was TERRIBLE. It took about 30 min to get our po boys. People who had walked in after us had to time to eat and leave before our food got to the table. When it did, it wasn't even hot. There is nothing worse than cold fried food, on hard french bread. Very disappointing.\n\nThe second time we came just for oysters and sat at the oyster bar. The service was very speedy, we got the char grilled oysters and the oyster Rockefeller. The char grilled didn't have any yummy crusty cheese or anything on top :( Just butter and seasoning.. so not that good. And the Rockefeller tasted completely different from the oysters we had the day before! Talk about inconsistent. I probably won't be back here when I return to Nola, but if you don't mind the inconsistencies I guess it could be a good place", "date": "2011-08-16 21:28:37"}

So I start walking from the Marriott.  Aimlessly at first, but then down Royal.  I have no idea where I'm going.  John H don't care.  John H just wants to eat shit and drink shit.  John H is hurting and wants to curl up like the Honey Badger, but he still don't care.\n\nSo I'm walking by this massive police station and reminded of times past in Nola and why I don't goto Bourbon Street even on Mardi Gras anymore.  I keep walking.  In the distance, I see the sign.  It seems like the clouds parted and a ray of sunlight was shining on it.  I figure either the Mardi Gras god's or the devil himself is pushing me towards this place.  Maybe the Mardi Gras god's and Beezlebub are the same entity.  Who cares.\n\nI walk in and I'm literally the only person in there.  It is, afterall, like 10am Nola time.  Shennanigans.  I sit down and ask for my typical Ketel One and Bloody.  They guy behind the bar quickly says, \"sure you don't want to try it with the infused vodka\"?  He points towards the large jar full of all things peppery, garlic like, etc.  I swear the damn thing had a light under it or maybe my vision was blurry due to lack of hydration.  \n\nI say yes to this.  Not knowing where this beginning of the day would take me.  You see, I'm a gluton for punishment.  I think my liver is just this awesome toy that kind of has a bypass around it.  Put up yellow caution signs \"road closed\", alcohol please take the detour.  NOPE.  Just punish that sucker even more.  Bloody Mary was the best one I've had in a while.  So good I had two and one is usually all I need before moving on to different alcohol.\n\nFood was next on the list.  Another bartender recommended their Chargrilled Oysters and Crab and Corn Bisque.  \"Ok, lady, don't give me any crap.  Is it as good as Drago's or not\".  I didn't really say it like that because I think she would've three-finger pimped slapped me, but it was what I was thinking.  She was awesome in her recommendations though.  Ordered that very shit she recommended.  \n\nFirst, the Crab and Corn Bisque.  I want to free-base this stuff.  Should've gotten the bowl.  Just awesome.  Then I moved onto Chargrilled Oysters.  What happens when you combine large oysters, butter, spices, parmesan cheese and a grille?  You come up with slap your mama good stuff.  Not kidding, I would've slapped my mama if she tried to grab one off my plate.  And yes, they were better than Drago's.\n\nAs usual stupidity would allow, I decided to stay there another 3 hours while my friends trickled in.  It was during this time that Mardi Gras monsoon 2012 decided to start.  Have white shirt, will rain.  Thank you to the group of 4 women who came in for lunch wearing white shirts after the deluge started.  Your presence was noted and appreciated by all.\n\nBig eff you to the weather though.  You rained out the Krewe of Tucks parade that we were all riding in.  \n\nGood stuff.  Try this place.  Pretty damned cool and that upstairs balcony would be awesome during Friday happy hour or Saturday/Sunday afternoon.", "date": "2012-02-20 22:05:30"}

When we sat down and they handed me this menu with only a couple choices, I was quite disappointed that they had removed the only dishes I was going to want.  I ended up ordering the French Onion Soup and a Caprese Salad because they were literally the only things on the Mardi Gras menu that I'd eat (I hate seafood...we chose this restaurant because it had Oysters and didn't have the insane line that Acme has). The soup was okay, though I did like that it had a lot of cheese, it definitely did not have a flavor that stood out as anything but a TGI Friday's quality soup.  The Caprese Salad was not only far too small, but it had onions on it.  What?  Onions on Caprese?  That is weird.  Plus, the restaurant didn't serve bread with the meal, nor with my soup or my Salad.  I requested bread and they charged me $2.50.  \n\nAlso, the wine selection is pretty bad.  It's basically only bottles that you can get at Trader Joe's for $10 or less.  Not a single decent wine on the list.  \n\nA funny thing happened though.  The women I was with think that the place is haunted.  One of them said she felt someone grab her arm (she screamed out of nowhere) and two of the other women said they saw something moving at that moment.  They asked the Waitress is weird things happen there and she had all kinds of stories.  So maybe if you're into the occult this place is a good option.  Also, the Crawfish Etouffee and Oysters got good reviews from the ladies in my party, but I'm basing my review on my own meal.\n\nDefinitely a better option than Acme Oyster House for tourists during peak times like Jazz Fest or Mardi Gras.  No need to wait in the line at Acme when Royal House has Oysters in a better location without the line.", "date": "2012-02-22 20:03:02"}

We were treated to the sights and sounds of Mardi Gras: there were a number of high fa-looting summer suit wearing ladies and dapper dressed gentlemen getting (including the mayor!) out of their posh rides to head over to Antoine's for krewe lunch. We witnessed the interesting politics of street entertainment where a tarot reader, a juggling act, and a five piece band were negotiating street spots and who got to set up where. And finally there were the weirdos of MG, dressed in all sorts of attire and in varying degrees of stupor at 10am. The waiter was very pleasant and chatty, just a clock-out away from full on fishing attire. Those are the highlights. We ordered a mojito, hurricane, shrimp po-boy, and a Caresse salad. My husband liked his po-boy and it was definitely sizable. My salad was okay and the mojito left a lot to be desired.

It's a cute restaurant, with a large bar in the front, and areas where people can sit in twos while looking out at the street and people watch.\n\nOur waitress recommended the honey Jack Daniels with lemonade, and since I'm a huge fan of Jack Daniels, I had to try.

A dozen raw, half a dozen of the rockefeller, a dozen of the chargrilled, and oysters royale.\n\nThe raw oysters had a saltier taste than others, more brimey, and I found a mini pearl as I was eating one, or chewed on it and thought maybe I broke a tooth. Nice little souvenier, nor did I know you could find pearls in oysters!\n\nThe oysters rockefeller was dissapointing. It was just a baked bready oyster, and I was thinking it would be like the chargrilled, but with spinach and herbs. Not what I had expected at all. The royale was the same, but more seafoody. The chargrilled oysters, you can't go wrong with all the butter and garlic and parmesean cheese. Yum!\n\nMy friend's gumbo was tasty, and the seafood portofino had a great sauce. My alligator po boy was okay, not the greatest, but the fries were coated in this extra batter that was pure deliciousness.\n\nReason for 3 stars is the raw oysters were our least favorite out of the 4 places we've tried, and service was lackluster.

Can't hate.\n\nAlthough some other reviewers placed this as a tourist trap, I'm actually more than happy to admit I would come here again.\n\nLocation and setup : It was a little bit of a walk but about 0.1 mi from our hotel. This is a hilarious distance for me but for my parents aged 5x, hungry, and after a long day of exploring the Mississippi River they were a little against walking far. Mom, why did you try to wear heeled sandals? I know it's a trend but they're not going to make you anywhere close to 5' 1\". Anyhow I digress, it's close to the river and close to Canal. Which is great plus it's quiet enough away from bourbon street to talk to your party.\n\nFood : We had --\n\nCrawfish Etouffee ($14.95) the waiter recommended adding fried crawfish ontop. So we had DOUBLE the amount of crawfish. It was so good, I actually thought it would be like shepherd's pie but the rice soaked the moisture of the sauce. It's good, but if you're not into stew-y food or wet foods you should pick something else. Best way to describe it for me was Arroz con Pollo cept Crawfish instead of chicken.\n\nAlligator Poboy ($12.95) alligator meat is sour and salty. Be prepared but my dad actually enjoyed it alot. Then again he loves salt. It tastes like grilled then fried lemon tilapia to me. Tilapia because it's white meat and still has that slight fish taste. It was good plus their seasons (double fried???) french fries were good.\n\nShrimp Poboy ($10.95) Classic is still a goodie. They do it right and affordable. Generous amount of friends and a very fresh bread to tag along. Good stuff!\n\nChargrilled Oysters ($15 for dozen) oh my god, I don't eat oysters but I had to try these. SO GOOD SO SOO GOOD. You must you must! I wish I had a drink to pair with it but since I'm out with the parents we're not allowed to drink. Buzzkill.\n\nBanana Foster Cheesecake ($6.95) very pretty and presented well. It was delicious and now I'm hooked on Banana Foster ANYTHING. Thank god I packed skirts and dresses instead of skinny jeans.\n\nLove the food, ambiance, live music, spacious seating and great location, but the most important to me regarding an outing with the folks was the service. My waiter was from Los Angeles and moved here and he's a very sharp guy. Speaks a bit of Korean, Japanese (from his time working in Beni Hana), French, and Spanish. He was very nice, quick, polite, and he actually came to our table without food to have a chat with us. My parents forgot about the aches in their feet and the walk or the loud crowds from Bourbon we had to pass, and just cared about the good food, music, and the light conversation.\n\nIn all, including our lemonades and a single beer plus tip the meal costs us about $90. Not bad at all for a party of 4.", "date": "2012-04-03 03:48:58"}

Of course I'm talking about the oysters. They are not bad at all, though I wished they can take a few more moments to let the shell rinse off a bit more. At least when you get them on half-shelves, fresh or  charbroiled, they are equally tasty. If you cannot decide, try the trio of Rockefeller, Royal, and Pepperino then.\n\nAs I mentioned, oysters were not their only trick in the pony stable; any other dishes on the menu can induce drooling at an instant.

This would be one of those times. After spending all day at Jazz Fest we were short on time before going to another show so we didn't get a chance to eat. By the time we left the show it was closing in on midnight. New Orleans is not like Manhattan where dinner time is somewhere between 9 and 10 o'clock and resturants continue to serve late into the night . Things were starting to close and Sara and I were worried about quality places to eat. \n\nWe had walked by Royal House several times before on our walks around town but usually had other places to go. Famished and delirious, (not really) we walk to the front door and ask in our best David Copperfield orphan voices if they were serving. The young man at the door noticed our plight and in the most nonchalant way I've ever heard, as if we asked him if he had bubble gum, \"Sure\".\n\nLeading us to a table along the street side of the restaurant we were seated in listening distance and visual view of a street performer playing Rolling Stones covers with lots of audience participation. It actually sounded pretty good and was entertaining to watch. Our waiter, Tim (the kind soul who seated us), brought out our menus and asked how we were and what kind of shananagins we had been up to. After some short banter he got to the specials and was very pleasant to talk to. \n\nOnce we ordered our food came out really quickly. I got the fried clams with pasta which was awesome. Not only cause I really hadn't eaten all day but because it was so flavorful. Everything was fresh not just the clams but the sauce as well. I wish I could remember what Sara got but I do remember it being very good. Tim was attentive and when there was time even chatted with us for a few minutes. \n\nWe really enjoyed ourselves and even though we were stuffed and exhausted from the day we wished to stay, but it was obvious that they were finally getting ready to close. When I come back to NOLA I will defiantly stop by here again and try some more of what they have to offer. Have to say was the best meal I had in my stay.", "date": "2012-05-15 01:25:44"}

What then, might you ask, was I doing in an oyster house in the middle of New Orleans?  For the sake of love, of course. I had the opportunity to dine at Royal House for a friend's wedding reception and thoroughly enjoyed myself, regardless of the fact that I didn't ingest a single ounce of oysters.\n\nFood: Royal House specializes in fresh oysters and seafood, but the menu also includes an assortment of non-surf appetizers, soups, salads, and entrees. A set buffet was offered for the reception that I attended, which included cheese, fruit, mini muffulettas, duck quesadillas, gumbo, and the restaurant's famed oysters. I found all the options to be fresh, well-prepared, and flavorful. Although I didn't try the oysters, they were literally flying off the tray immediately upon delivery, so I can only assume that they were perfectly delightful. \n\nService: Every staff member, from the bartenders to the banquet staff, was personable, professional, and efficient. They were also fairly proficient at replenishing the dishes in a timely manner, particularly the oysters.  \n\nAtmosphere: Royal House is located in a historic building in the heart of the French Quarter. The restaurant is located on two separate floors - the oyster bar occupies most of the first floor, while an additional dining room and outdoor patio are located on the second floor.  I was told by the staff that the restaurant that originally occupied this building, Tortorici's, frequently hosted Hollywood elites like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.\n\nCost: The regular food menu is moderately priced. Appetizers are $8-$11, soups and salads are $6-$13, po-boys and sandwiches are $10-$15, entrees are $15-$25, and desserts are $6-$8. Raw oysters are $7/half dozen and $12/dozen, while charbroiled oysters are $8/half dozen and $15/dozen.\n\nOther: Hours of operation are Monday-Friday, 11AM-12AM, and Saturday-Sunday, 9AM-12AM. Breakfast is served on the weekends from 9AM-11AM. 18% gratuity is added to parties of 5 or more.", "date": "2012-05-23 01:16:29"}

I don't know if it was the manager or the waiter to blame for this, but it tarnished an otherwise good experience.\n\nMy entrees were also delicious.  I don't remember exactly what I ate, but my notes said that I like it a lot.\n\nSo overall, the food was very good and the service was mostly good.  I would definitely go back to Royal House.", "date": "2012-07-14 12:58:25"}

Living in Nashville now, you can get good seafood, but you have to pay a premium for it. And, it's missing that extra element of fresh that you just can't get in a non-port town. That being said, these oysters were so fresh, I was amazed. \n\nEnded up getting the cooked trio of oysters as well. Highly recommend. \n\nIf you are in the mood for fresh oysters or seafood, go here immediately.", "date": "2012-11-21 15:27:10"}

Unfortunately, it did not really have breakfast but they looked like they had pretty good oysters. My boyfriend had not had the opportunity this trip to get oysters yet so we decided to give it a try. \n\nFirst off, the service. The service was fantastic. The host made a point of talking to us, asked how many, sat us at our table, etc. The usual. However, he also let us know where the bathrooms were, the bar, who our server would be and really made us feel at home and comfortable. It was something that was easy but quickly set the Royal House apart. Our server was named Robert. He was also really nice. Originally we were planning on using a \"check-in deal\" from Yelp that allowed a free appetizer with a purchase. However, Robert informed us you had to buy two entrees that cost a specific amount and since we were just looking for something light we decided to skip the deal and give it a try anyways. In the middle of the meal a parade went down Royal Street for the Sugar Bowl. We were trying to peer out the windows to see and Robert made a point of coming over and telling us to just head outside and check out the parade, and \"no one will bother our food.\" After the parade, one of the employees walked around delivering beads to ALL of the customers that he had collected during the parade. Service was definitely a 5 star. \n\nThe food (and drinks). We started with a Bloody Mary each. They infused vodka in house which we were really excited to try. The drinks were good, but they were a little thin at the end and being in New Orleans for a few days I was hoping for a great Bloody Mary where you could taste the seasonings the whole time and never thinned out from ice. The food was good. Ben liked his oysters a lot and thought they were really fresh. We split some spinach dip and an order of hush puppies. Both were good, but unfortunately none of the food was amazing. \n\nI would definitely return for the service!", "date": "2013-01-04 21:38:32"}

After walking around all day, we were ready to sit, and wanted a drink. We passed Royal House, noticed that there were tables open on the balcony and our decision was made. \n\nThe host who helped us upstairs was great. Our interaction lasted maybe 45 seconds, but he had me laughing as he went through his whole spiel of the only rule being that we can have whatever we want as he let us pick out our table. Very nice guy, and he set the tone for great service. This was continued through our server, who took great care of us even though our ticket price was probably a bit lower than people having a full meal. Great customer service, all the way.\n\nNow for food, we did get a bit to much on. We had a dozen oysters and fried alligator bites. Both were tasty. The portion size for the gator was tiny, but I think that's to be expected. The oysters were quite large and delicious! I cannot recall the price any more, but it was definitely reasonable. A bottle of champagne rounded things out, which I think cost somewhere in the high $30s, again reasonable.\n\nI think what made this experience stand out for me was the great people watching of the balcony. We had front row seats to not only a magician but also a really great bluegrass band. I don't get a lot of street performance back home, so I definitely get a kick out of it when traveling to places like New Orleans. And personally, I think the best view to watch the French Quarter shenanigans is from above.\n\nI wouldn't say that Royal House was a fantastic culinary adventure or a \"best kept secret\" type of establishment, but it fit our needs perfectly and left us with some good vacation memories.

I chose Royal House because of it's pretty good review on Yelp and the food was, in fact, pretty good!  We were seated near the windows which made for great weekend people watching and our server was friendly, upbeat and more than happy to assist what was probably her millionth tourist of the night.  With my Yelp checkin I received a free appetizer of up to $10 which really covered only one appetizer, spinach dip.  That's right, spinach dip at a seafood restaurant.  No thanks!  We inquired about the other apps on the menu and she stated that we could cover any amount over the $10 limit, which we agreed to do and ordered the crab claws.  Because we were splitting the bill (thanks to the corporate credit card) the amount would be charged to my card but half of the discount would go to me and half would go to my mom.  Weird.  The claw tips were good, small, and served in a delicious \"calorie conscious\" lemon garlic butter sauce with toasted french bread for dipping.  The french bread wasn't exactly fresh, and the claws were exactly meaty, but it was good for a free app.  For dinner I ordered the jambalaya with grilled shrimp and my mom ordered the shrimp po boy.  The shrimp were large and cooked perfectly while the jambalaya was flavorful but lacking the spice I had hoped for.  My mom said her po boy was delicious and more flavorful than others she had while in town.  Although our server was great about refills in the beginning, she totally disappeared towards the end of the meal.  It seemed like we waited at least 20 minutes after we finished eating to get our bill, and then quite some time after we set out our cards to complete the transaction.  It wasn't overly busy so I couldn't really figure out what the holdup was!  Overall it was a good meal in a historic building with a nice view of the oyster bar.

A little seasoning would have done wonders.\n\nBut the service is why I'm writing. Listen, if I'm going to drop $100+ on a meal, I expect the wait staff to actually wait on the table. I don't expect to be kept waiting nearly 20 minutes before having someone come over to take first drink order.\n\nAnd considering that my husband is in the food business, it was unbelievably insulting to have the waiter deliver a drink that was supposed to be a Crown Royal Whiskey on the rocks - and it wasn't. We're still not sure what it was, but it wasn't Crown - it had a strange rye-meets-rubbing-alcohol-or-some-sort-of-cleaner flavor and smell.\n\nNow, these sorts of mistakes happen, and typically it's no big deal.

Once we got a waitress after 15 mins of wait, when she found out we were only here fur the dozen oysters, her demeanor completely changed and she made it clear that she wasn't happy that we weren't sitting in fOR a meal. Terrible service. Immature behavior. Whether we get a drink or not or a meal, you treat your customers the same.", "date": "2013-05-22 00:37:38"}

She tells us it's not her call it is the managers.  Earlier in the eve about 5 or so we were walking past and my husband spoke to the mgr about bananas foster and asked when their kitchen closed.  When the hostess got the mgr, he remembered that he had seen us earlier and said that one two top wasn't gonna hurt them.  He took us to our tables and we had desert within 15 min.  I didn't give this restaurant 5 strs because we just had desert but if this sort of service is an indication of the attention they pay to everything else I cannot I,aging they are worth less than a 5 star rating.

I wish I could give this place a .5. It was one of the worst places I have ever eaten in my entire life. I would eat some dirty street food before eating or drinking here again. First and foremost, we had the worst service, the fellow we had didn't even deserve a tip, his service was atrocious at best. We started with drinks I ordered a pear martini and my other ordered a bloody mary. The pear martini was made with the Worst tasting ingredients of all time and so much melon liquor that is all I could taste.  so bad. The bloody mary I am told was just as bad and overly salty. (We never got another drink because the server was too busy to wait on us and never again once throughout the entire meal asked if we wanted a water or another drink). We then ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which was actually very good, it is a very simple thing to make. Unfortunately, when the waiter took our drink order when he took our food order as well and we never saw him again until we were finished with our meals. I ordered the steak because I don't eat seafood. First mistake because it is USDA choice beef being the worst quality of beef with a better name. The steak came out under cooked, flavorless and cold. It said Cajun and creole, this is laughable!!! The sides were just as bad as the steak, cold and flavorless. My other ordered gumbo and oysters. The gumbo was flavorless and to his knowledge there was no seafood in a seafood gumbo. As horrible and repulsive as the oysters looked to me and my other half, he said they tasted fine and they didn't make him sick so that is all that matters. But if you could see oysters before you bought them we wouldn't of bought them because they looked like the lowest quality oysters ever. If our server would of came back and asked how our meal was I would of sent mine back and asked for nothing else. I ate about a quarter of a $30.00 steak when the server took my plate he didn't even ask if I was done or how my meal was. He took my others plate and again didn't ask him if he was done and he was in fact still eating. (this was again the first time we saw our waiter since he took our order and no other server checked on us through the entire meal). This place is a tourist trap that gets tourists with their balcony!!!) We tipped the dude $9.00 on a $100.00 bill but he didn't even deserve a dollar. I am one to tip very well when warranted,  if you are a good server and even if you are having a bad day and I can tell I still  tip well but if you give it no effort at all you deserve no tip!!! The food and service at this place are absolutely horrendous!!! Save your money and your time!!!!", "date": "2013-05-28 23:05:49"}

What drew me in was that they had fried alligator and and alligator poboy on the menu AND there was a yelp check in deal (buy 2 entrees and get a free appetizer up to $9.95).  \n\nService was pretty quick and friendly.  My boyfriend and i had originally ordered the alligator poboy, blackened shrimp jambalaya, crab claws, and the oyster maque choux (6 in an order).  Sadly, our server told us that they were out of the crab claws and apologized.  We then quickly switched the appetizer to the fried alligator instead of the crab claws and got the fried catfish poboy instead of the alligator poboy.\n\nthe food came out quickly.  The oysters maque choux were like little corn chowders with a whole oyster served in the oyster shell.  if you like oysters and chowder, this is really good.  it was pipping hot and the shells retained the heat.  the fried alligator was like popcorn chicken with the texture of pork.  i have to say, it was pretty awesome.  not gamey at all like some other alligator meat  i have tried (in California of course).\n\nFor the entrees, the fried catfish sandwich was just that....a fried fish sandwich.  only complaint  i have is that the bread was a little too toasted, but the fish was fried perfectly.  The jambalaya with blackened shrimp was awesome in flavor and texture.  my biggest complaint is that  i do not understand why there were 3 slices of bread on the top and a pickled whole pepperoncini in the middle for garnish.  this was not necessary and it looked like they were just throwing stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, i liked it and was most impressed with the oysters (i like chowdah).  price is probably a little high but it is touristy, so it is to be expected", "date": "2013-06-14 00:08:56"}

Our waitress said she was on her last night of training, but we felt that she did an excellent job throughout the night and had a great personality. \n\nWe placed our drink orders from the bar after looking over the cocktail menu for a few minutes, then ordered entrees at the same time. The bar and restaurant were full, but it didn't seem overly crowded at the time. Our drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive and only seemed to be made quicker because the waitress noticed me constantly looking over my shoulder at the bar. \n\nMy wife just ordered a bowl of gumbo, which she said was flavorful and that she enjoyed it. I had the shrimp platter, which was also good. Both of our portion sizes were larger than average, but just the right size. \n\nAs we contemplated desert, we were told that all of the tables around us had chosen the bread pudding, so we did the same. It came out pretty quickly and it was moist and tasted fresh. \n\nBesides the drink order being slow, my only gripe is that I felt like we were being rushed a few times throughout our meal. The dessert menu was dropped off and explained with our entrees. After having our entrees for about 10 minutes, we were both just sitting and talking, but clearly had a good portion of food left on our plates. The waitress came by and sort of motioned for the plates and asked if we were done. Not a huge deal though. \n\nWe both had enjoyed our dinner, so we ended up returning the next night. I had the same thing, but my wife got the blackened redfish for her entree, which she loved. We also got the redfish beignets that were recommended the night before. Those were simply amazing and neither of us could stop talking about how great they were. Definitely get those and take advantage of the free appetizer deal from Yelp if it's still going on and you're ordering 2 or more entrees. Our service didn't feel as rushed the 2nd night, but we were also there a little earlier in the evening. The drinks that we ordered from the bar were just as slow as the night before, and the bar was nearly empty this time. Maybe the bartender is just inexperienced or could use an additional hand back there.  \n\nOverall, Royal House is a great choice if you're staying in the French Quarter.", "date": "2013-10-29 16:40:21"}

Worst restaurant we've ever experienced. The place looked very inviting from the outside. It has a pretty balcony on the second floor where diners can sit and enjoy the view below. Unlike some other places near Bourbon, it appears to be clean, have a nice ambience and upscale furnishings. That's all it has to offer. If you just want a drink and to sit and people watch, then it would be fine. But as a restaurant, it's horrible. Only the glass of Pinot Noir and the raw oysters we had were decent. Everything else that required cooking, was disgusting. All cooked items tasted like old food they bought at Costco. That's an insult to Costco and isn't meant to be because food bought at Costco frozen and cooked at home would have tasted 100 times better. I don't know where people get the pictures seen on Yelp because the food we received was nothing like that. I read so much about the reviews of shrimp and grits and was let down- they were ice cold. You can eat pasta cold but grits are like an oatmeal dish. When hot, good but when cold, they turn into hard putty. I had to carve a slice of the grits out to taste. I never return food and had to reject them. The staff was not surprised when I complained..it seemed they are used to getting complaints all day. They brought me replacement grits-my SAME dish back that had been heated up in the microwave. I know it was the same dish because it still had my carving in it. The heat didn't help. No flavor, disgusting and tasted like processed food. My husband got the seafood pasta dish and was not impressed. Nothing tasted fresh cooked. We never use coupons but since we had used the map on yelp to find Royal, a coupon popped up for a free dish. We were so upset with our other food, we were not going to use the free desert coupon but because we couldn't eat our other dishes, we were still hungry. We got the bread pudding with ice cream. My husband even said beforehand, at least they can't mess up ice cream. Well they did, the ice cream tasted like cheap generic old ice cream and the bread pudding was a cold tasteless mess.  If you want raw oysters, go to Acme. It's a no frills place - a dive actually but at least they have fresh real food and nice waiters for much less cost. If you wan to spend a little more money and have an amazing meal, go to Louisiana Bistro. It's a dive also but an amazing chef and every time we come to NOLA we go there because the meals are unforgettable.", "date": "2013-10-30 18:10:37"}

My family and I all flew to NOLA for a wedding and it happend to be my brother's birthday the next day on 10/27/13.  So we, nine of us, decided to go to Royal House Oyster Bar for his birthday dinner.\n\nOur drinks took longer than usual, which was fine.  Then we finally got our appetizers of variety of oyster platters which were delicious, but the fries were cold, which I thought was odd.  \n\nWithin 5 minutes we were being rushed to finish our appetizers as a tray of our entrees were sitting there, waiting.  Which, at the time, I thought that was weird, but whatever, we were hungry.  Once I got my dish, the shrimp creole, it wasn't even warm.  I asked my family around me and found out that the Taste of New Orleans, the Shrimp and Grits and another rice plate were ALL cold.  All of the fries were cold as well.  I asked the server to reheat our plates, when they brought it back, it still wasn't hot.\n\nNot once did we get an apology or a recognition of the bad service and cold food, we asked the server to bring the manager over to see if there was anything they can do.  The server says, \"Well, since you did eat all of the food, I don't know what it is that he can do\".  First of all, we did NOT eat all off the food.  Everything was cold and quite frankly, besides the oysters, the rest of the food wasn't even good.  My shrimp creole dish looked like half of it came out of a tomato paste can.  Gross.\n\nAs if the comment from the server wasn't already the worst customer service (remember you rushed me appetizers to give all cold food), the manager comes over and yells \"Who's the one who had the issues?\"  The four of us at the end of the table with the cold food.  ME!  He comes over, not once apologized for anything or even asked me what the issues were.  Just showed me the bill and that they took of 15%.  SMH.  You couldn't even ask me what happened?  Never once acknowledge the fact that our service was below average.  Then come at us with \"Who is the one who had a problem?\"  I SURE DID.\n\nUnreal.  You're a restaurant.

Our party of 3 (later joined by a 4th) lucked out and was seated upstairs very close to the patio...perfect since it was inside so the threatening rainclouds didn't really worry us, but close enough to the outside that we were able to enjoy the gorgeous, misty evening view and air.  I think the downstairs is much more casual, but the upstairs area really made for a beautifully lit and romantic atmosphere in quaint a New Orleans house (although none of my dinner companions were mah boo :-P). The food was good, although I only got raw oysters and wine, which is all I wanted.  Oysters were fresh and good sized, shucked correctly.\n\nThe service, though, was veeeerrrry inexperienced.  In her defense, she was this pixie-haired maybe 22-yr old sweet girl that just did not know what she was doing. We ended up getting bottles of wine, and for whatever reason, we realized after the second glass that she was FILLING our glasses to the brim, i.e. y'know how a wine pour is only perhaps 1/3 of the glass, maybe a 1/2 if someone is generous?  She was pretty much pouring them to the very top of the glass...and it wasn't to give us more wine since we'd already bought the whole bottle.  And when we asked her to pour smaller pours for the second bottle, she was a little miffed/confused as to why.  *sigh*  A bit flighty, but again, I just chalk it  up to inexperience.  We had to ask for water.  She would drop things, like the silverware, when she tried to collect things off our table. Very sweet and smiley though. \n\nStill - great ambiance, good food overall.", "date": "2013-12-03 18:06:19"}

At least 10 juicy shrimp on a bed of the most delicious grits I had over the whole trip. The chopped veggies and gouda really  give them a great flavour and creaminess.

Famished, we stumbled in here because it was the first restaurant we came to.  My boyfriend ordered two appetizers (unfortunately cannot remember what these were, but they were seafood based) and (after learning that they were out of the poor boy that was my first choice) I ordered the Rib Eye.  The appetizers my boyfriend ordered were good, but not great.  The Rib Eye was a crime.  Paying almost $30 for a piece of meat, I expect a halfway decent steak (even if I did make the rookie mistake of ordering a steak at a seafood place).  What I received was a very thin, dry, flavorless piece of commodity meat.  Whatever it was, it wasn't like any ribeye I've ever eaten (an I have eaten a fair few), especially at that price.  As hungry as I was, I could not eat more than a few bites.  When our waitress came to clear our plates, she asked me if I wanted to take it with me.  No, I said, because clearly time was not going to improve this.  She then told me I should have it wrapped up and find a homeless person to give it to.  Look, I appreciate the thought and certainly I have given away my leftovers before, but it is inappropriate to, once I have paid a bunch of money for something I consider inedible, then put the responsibility on me a to wander around the Quarter late at night looking for someone to give it away to.  Great, just want I want after a long day of travel, to overpay for something I don't want to eat and then have to wander around trying to find a way to dispose of it.  Yup.  \n\nCute place, appetizers are decent, and staff is reasonably friendly.  I just wouldn't necessarily advocate getting dinner here.", "date": "2014-02-09 22:27:06"}

In actuality, it was a bowl of mushy beans with a small portion of rice, topped with one tiny chicken strip, and one slice of sausage. Let's just say.. my stomach wanted to cry after getting increasingly excited over the past hour and a half and then seeing a cold mushy bowl of beans before me.\n\nI would NOT recommend coming to this place for food, but if you're looking for a nice, relaxing spot to stop for drinks-sure.

It sounds so wrong ( fish and beignet and syrup!?!) but it is so so right with the crystal beurre blanc sauce. So fantastic we had to order a second batch.  Atmosphere is perfect for people watching and having a great dining experience. Wonderful value for the price. Can't wait to come back!!", "date": "2014-04-20 18:35:33"}

I wasn't a fan of the jambalaya - luke warm at best and not very flavorful. Crawfish etouffee was delicious and seafood gumbo had a slight kick. Both had lots of seafood in the dishes. We had also ordered the Creole shrimp. This was a much better dish than the sampler - hot, tastes fresh and the tomato based sauce was not as heavy as the cream based dishes.

Our party of 11 came here on a Friday evening several weeks ago. The wait to be seated was 40 minutes, but reasonable considering we had no reservations and there was both a festival and conference occurring that weekend. The host was very understanding and accommodating.\n\nSoon we were seated upstairs. The d\u00e9cor was warm and classic with glittering chandeliers. Several couples tables were located on the balcony. Quite a lovely place to be while vacationing in NOLA. Vintage and charming. \n\nService was average. We were kindly offered two complementary appetizers via Yelp check-in considering there were 11 of us who waited quite awhile. However, the food came out incredibly slow overall. It took an hour for appetizers to arrive and another 30 minutes for entrees. Our soft drinks also took 30+ minutes because the restaurant ran out of ice. \n\nFor appetizers, my friends and I shared the baked oyster duo, French onion soup, and redfish beignets. The oysters duo included the oysters Rockefeller--topped with spinach & bacon and to a baked golden brown, and the oysters Royale--topped with a bubbly seafood bake. Both were fine but unmemorable. The French onion soup was standard. The redfish beignets, recommended by our server, were fried golden brown fish filets served with sweet beurre blanc and powdered sugar. They tasted exactly as they sound and A-OK. \n\nFor entrees, many of us ordered the crawfish ravioli which was highly recommended by the server. Unfortunately, the dish was loaded with green and red pepper chunks which overwhelmed the other flavors. It definitely was not the rich, savory crawfish ravioli dish we had been expecting. \n\nThe other half of our party ordered raw oyster platters. Unfortunately, they came out quite late. We could not all enjoy our meal together due to the poor timing. I don't prefer raw oysters but they were reportedly delicious, although I imagine hard to mess up. \n\nOverall, the food was average and the only true problem was the very slow kitchen. We would probably only return here for drinks or shucked oysters.", "date": "2014-04-28 07:16:48"}

In the midst of small talk between myself and the chef NiRobi I explained to him my history of dining and playing it safe on most decisions. He explained that I cannot continue with this way of thinking and asked me if I had ever tried oysters?  I explained to him that due to my 'assumption' that oysters were all slimy in texture I stayed away from them. \nHe decided to crack one open right in front of me, explained that the slime from afar was nothing but water. He then placed on a cracker and added cocktail sauce and told me try. At that very moment of taking a couple of bites I was beside myself for passing up this experience in prior dining experiences. Chef NiRobi was very detailed in explaining why the combination of the cracker and cocktail sauce was the best way of trying oysters for the first time!  Obviously my fianc\u00e9e was pleased with this as well since it meant we would eat other foods!\nSo after his wonderful advice we followed another suggestion of his where he explained that during the day in NOLA one should eat appetizers only and save entrees for when you are ready to go to sleep (since the food is so rich). Upon his advice the Mrs and I ordered fried alligator, charbroiled oysters with Parmesan cheese, and deep fried red fish in a sweet batter similar to beignets. OMG!!!!!!!!! Everything was delicious. Preparation superb! NOLA spices and flavor self evident.\nI hope this review has sold you. I'll try to upload a pic.", "date": "2014-05-17 23:31:21"}

So we came back the next night. We were seated in the upstairs dining room promptly but it took over 7 minutes for our waitress, Cindy, to acknowledge us.  She was very busy toting plates of oysters up the stairs to diners in her section.  She was very animated and funny, but was sort of frustrated with her coworkers earlier in the day, with her neighbor, and with the very melancholy singer outside the window across the street.  Not sure why she shared this information with us... maybe because it was late, or because we seemed friendly and receptive... Its fine, just not what we expected in a restaurant that seemed to be a pretty old-school, formal place. (At least they were not so fancy so as to be bothered with us showing up in very casual day clothes!) She was very helpful with menu suggestions, however, and we placed our order, taking advantage of the yelp complimentary appetizer.) It took a long time to get our beverages, a coke and a bottled beer. Our appetizer came out next. We got fried gator bites, which were great.  For the main course, my BF got a fried seafood sampler. I got linguine with fried oysters mushrooms, and spinach. My BF's platter looked like it was from a county fair or something. Mainly fries and hush puppies, a little catfish and shrimp. Basically a huge \"kiddie plate,\" but he said it was good. My food was tasty but very light on oysters, spinach, and mushrooms. I got lemon and red pepper to enhance the cream sauce, which was heavier than I expected.   We got the deconstructed bananas foster cheesecake for dessert. It was heavy but tasted fine.  The graham cracker \"cookie\" in the middle was a brick and nearly impossible to break with forks.  So as the girl outside bleated on with her torchy renditions of Sarah McLaughlin, Joni Mitchell, etc., and our waitress griped jovially about all kinds of stuff, we rolled back out into the quarter with our bellies full, wondering how we could have made a better dining decision on our last night in NOLA.", "date": "2014-06-04 23:04:50"}

By the time we finished our snack, my happiness returned and Hubbs changed his mind about ACME. So we decided to go somewhere around the area, and Royal House was our lucky location (short line + 4 stars = winner).\n\nWhen I checked in, I saw that we got a free appetizer, so we ordered the Redfish Beignets (my hope was a perfect mix of sweet and savory). And since I wasn't that hungry, I got a bowl of French Onion soup. Hubbs ordered two orders of the Chargrilled Oysters (12 total) and the gumbo.\n\nRedifsh Beignets were... kind of weird. I guess I was thinking that the batter was going to be more fluffy than crunchy. To me, it was just deep fried fish with syrup on it. The french onion soup was perfect... great onion flavor, good layer of melty, gooey cheese with a crustini on top. I'm not a fan of gumbo, so I thought Hubbs' gumbo was okay but he liked it. And he really liked the oysters and gobbled them up in a hot second.\n\nLater we found out that the appetizer wasn't complimentary. Mainly because we were supposed to order two entrees in order to get that deal. Our waiter could've told us, but just gave us a full-priced bill instead. Whomp whomp.\n\nI guess being a not-fan of seafood makes me feel \"meh\" about this place. I wouldn't come back.", "date": "2014-06-05 19:35:15"}

You can either sit upstairs on the balcony, inside at the various 2-tops with the street view, at the small inside dining area or the actual Oyster Bar. This place has a vintage yet modern feel. Looks the the interior is old but kept up very well. The seats are comfy and this place isn't crowded. \n\nService: Our server greeted us relatively quickly btw I loved the staff's attire.

Holy cow. We were all severely disappointed. The hostess and waiters were rude, slow and disrespectful. The bar tenders, however, were super awesome. But again, the wait staff were appalling. Additionally the food was HORRIBLE. No one in our group was satisfied. \n\nI even ordered the shrimp and grits again thinking they'd be the same as last time. Boy was I wrong. The grits were deep fried in these triangle shapes. It was disgusting! The shrimp were in a sauce that was not enjoyable either. I only ate the shrimp to avoid starving. I left the restaurant overall very upset. We will not be returning. \n\nThey do still make a mean bloody Mary though. So if you must go, head to the bar. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW FROM MARCH 2014:\n\nI was in NOLA for Mardi Gras for my first time back in March. We stopped here for lunch on our second day and I was absolutely BLOWN away by the food. One of the BEST meals I have ever had in my life.\n\nIt was early but there was a wait, but we were fine with that so we hit the bar. I'm not a fan of bloody marys but my friends are. They all ordered one and they honestly looked amazing! They were served with all of these marinated vegetables it was practically a side salad. I gave it a try and really liked it! But I ordered one of their custom margaritas instead and was LOVING it.\n\nWe were brought upstairs when our table was ready and upon walking up I saw someone's dish that looked AMAZING. I asked the server what it was and he told me it was the Shrimp & Grits. Knew we had to order it!\n\nWe had a decent sized party and none of us had been to NOLA before so we decided to do it family style and order a bunch of different things and split it all. I got the Shrimp & Grits and the rest got some oysters, a shrimp po-boy and some etoufee. Everything really was fantastic and so was the service. But the star of the meal was definitely the shrimp and grits. I'd never had a dish like that before and I literally fell in love. We honestly wanted to return again the next day just to eat that again but decided we should do something different while we're in town for the short time.\n\nWe had a perfect experience here and I will definitely be returning. Get the Shrimp & Grits! Fabulous!", "date": "2014-07-15 16:13:18"}

I like to think I was pretty successful. We were on the hunt for a place that covered what everyone wanted, and with 9 people, that was tough. We found ourselves standing in front of a restaurant called Royal House Oyster Bar.  After perusing the menu, we all settled on eating there.  I had already tried oysters, shrimp, gumbo,  and jambalaya so I went with the crab legs for lunch. We shared a bunch of fried alligator at the table as well.  Here in Denver, there is a place call Bayou Bob's that has some awesome fried alligator, but this one was so much better.  They were actual pieces, like chicken nuggets. Great flavor and very tender, I would put these at the top of great things I ate in New Orleans. The crab legs came out and the bowl looked very inviting. A couple of crab clusters, corn on the cob rolled in Cajun seasoning, and giant red potatoes.  The one thing missing was the butter.  I had to ask for it to be brought out. They were quick to respond and brought out a very large bowl of drawn butter with tiny pieces of green onion in it.  I don't think this changed the flavoring, just added to the presentation. Overall, most of the party of 9 were happy with their choice.  I think, everyone was on the same page though, and feel that Acme Oyster House was better and less expensive.  Oh and a quick drink recommendation: get the pineapple cucumber mojito", "date": "2014-08-10 16:54:32"}

The jambalaya was spicy, but not overly so. The gumbo was loaded with seafood, and the crawfish etouffee just incredible. Also had a side of hush puppies. I'm not a southerner so I don't claim to be an expert on this southern classic, but these were some of the yummiest hush puppies I've ever had. They were light yet still dense and very tender. Not the heavy dry balls that some places give you. I'm a bread pudding fanatic so dessert was bread pudding. It was ok, edible, but not something I would order again.

The ambience was very welcoming and didn't have that tourist trap feel, a nice local vibe.  The interior decor was classic with dim lighting throughout.  If you prefer a brighter atmosphere, request a table on the second floor where the endless windows illuminate the dining area or even sit on the balcony.

The grits were SUPER creamy, because how else do you want them? What really took it over the top for me was this sauce that we accidentally received. My bf wanted to substitute a side, and our server had to ring in something in order to 'upcharge' us. The price of this accidental sauce, I think it was called Royal sauce, covered the upcharge, but the kitchen accidentally made the sauce and the food runner accidentally brought it out. It was creamy, perhaps like a rose/blush sauce, and had seafood in the sauce. It was ridiculous and I poured that shit all over my grits! If you read this, order the grits and ask for the Royal sauce on the side (make sure that it's creamy and seafoodey and that I have the right name). Trust me, it's worth it to try to ask and it's worth the upcharge!\n\nI really liked that they had a Yelp check in offer; I didn't see any other restaurants in the area catering to us like that. Our free app choice was the crawfish cakes, a popular choice. The cakes were really good. Not as amazing as our dinner, but very yummy. \n\nLastly, the balcony provided a nice atmosphere. It had all the upsides of eating outside, and it was far enough away from the street to avoid smelling the French Quarter while dining. :) I do want to warn you that the balcony does not = elegant. It's super casual, tables are very small, and the balcony structure has a very noticeable slant that made me maybe slightly nervous.", "date": "2014-08-22 14:16:14"}

Pathetic. \nThis place is a complete tourist trap.  All the food is greasy, full of oil and butter and overall disgusting.  Went with another couple and two of the others ordered the same seafood pasta dish and one of the dishes had 90% of the seafood and the other had 10% which only had 1 non opened clam.  Seafood was not fresh.  Obviously the cooks don't understand the concept of dividing portions.  I ordered a scampi dish which was completely drenched in butter and way too spicy... Clearly the container of hot red pepper fell into the dish. Disgusting.  Five minutes into eating the pasta was cold and you could see the puddles of oil. Also we did not receive any silverware and had to ask twice for it while the appetizers of so called char broiled oysters soaked in butter got cold.  We asked for some extra bread and it took forever to arrive. Would give this dump a -5 stars if possible.  Just because there are white tablecloths on the table doesn't mean you can charge exorbitant prices For sub par fare. Stay away.

It was fantastic!\n\nI love Royal House and I will definitely be back. I feel like it's the perfect NOLA casual dining experience for local and tourist alike. They have everything on the menu from salads and sandwiches to shrimp and oysters platters, so you are sure to find something that you will enjoy.", "date": "2014-09-11 19:28:23"}

We noticed the sign for the Royal House as we meandered about the local Outlet Mall. As we made our way towards to restaurant, I thought about all the delicious oysters I was about to consume. As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a gentleman (who's name escapes me) who gave us a beautiful smile and immediately accepted our request to sit on the upstairs balcony. Because I live in Las Vegas, as a native southerner, I could feel a thunderstorm in the air and I did not want to miss it. As we made our way upstairs, our host inquired about our day and referred to us as \"his Queens\" which I found, quite frankly, adorable. As we approached the balcony, we saw mainly two tops and since we were a three, decided on sitting inside with the windows open and a great view of the street blow. I had a smoke on the balcony in anticipation on the dozen raw oysters I had ordered. I wanted a hundred but decided a dozen would do! They did not disappoint. They were plump, delicious and fresh. My aunt's fried oyster puff pastry, my crab salad and my cousin's chicken sandwich were all delicious. Eric, our server, delivered impeccable service. Upon his suggestion, I ordered the chocolate brownie sundae as dessert. It was a perfect ending. We were clearly Eric's last table, and being in the hospitality industry myself, I noticed he was in no way shape or form rushing us through our meal.  As we left, I made sure to let the host know how much I appreciated his hospitality. I love being back home in the south and I was reminded about how much I love home when I saw Eric walking down the street, free for the day. He noticed me, greeted me and went to enjoy the rest of his afternoon. The Royal House FAR EXCEEDED my expectations and I plan on visiting every single time I am in New Orleans.

Next we had the stuffed mushrooms which were even more amazing! It got better and better! These were the best stuffed mushrooms ever. 5 more stars!

We mixed the shrimp with the rice and the jumbalaya was good, but at first it was lacking flavor and spice before I mixed it.

I was looking forward to having dessert because they sounded good, but after the rest of the bland, mediocre food we thought better of it. I wish I had saved the $70 and gone to a better restaurant.", "date": "2014-10-28 01:01:22"}

For dinner we had the chargrilled oysters, shrimp and grits and crawfish entoufee. This was my fist time having shimrp and grits but I saw a picture here and wanted to try it, my gosh did I drool when I saw it, it had a perfect balance of buttery rich grits with a tangy shimp sauce to accompany it as well as perfectly seasoned shrimp. The oysters and crawfish were great too, but the shrimp and grits is a must try. Now time for dessert, THE BANANA FOSTER CHEESECAKE! OMG one of the best desserts I ever had in my life and I am from NYC, so I have tried everything. I had no clue what to expect and when we got it, I was a bit confused. There were these scoops which seemed like icecream but it was actually cheesecake. The cookie crust was molded together to a triangle int he center amongst the cheesecake scoops, banana foster and caramel, with a drizzel of caramel and banana cream sauce and the smoothest whipped cream. This was heaven on a plate, I have searched all over back home to see if we have it and we don't. I would fly down just to get it again. A MUST TRY.", "date": "2014-10-28 20:29:25"}

You're better off if you have someone else as your server as he wasn't really around when we needed him, and when we flagged him down, he'd tell us he'd be right there, and continue in his conversation with another server.\n\nThe place is pretty crowded in that there isn't much space between your table and the next in their more general seating area. \n\nWe ordered the Peel-n-Eat Shrimp, the Taste of New Orleans, and the Fried Alligator. The Peel-n-Eat Shrimp were okay with a little spice, but the shells seemed to stick firmly onto the shrimp so that by the time you got it all off, your piece of shrimp looked like it had been run over by an 18-wheeler. Poor skills on our part I guess. They were cooked well, but could have used more flavor. Something like $16 for a pound.\n\nFried Alligator tasted like overdone frog legs. Nothing special. Too much fried batter. Wish I didn't order it.\n\nThe Taste of New Orleans was pretty disappointing. They had a small cup of the etouffee, and a small cup of the gumbo accompanied with a small up of their jambalaya. The jambalaya was chalky dry and all the items in it were severely overcooked. The two soups came out lukewarm and were all in all disappointing. I like my soups hot. I think the temperature helps make or break a soup.

Even one said \"it was like I remembered from Disneyland (non-alcohol).\"  There were even dead brown/black mint leaves in one glass.  I've never had this drink, but according to the provided drink list, it should have had simple syrup, mint and booze.  The drink was reported as \"not sweet at all, and very little booze.\"  I said they MUST HAVE put soda water in it, since I know ss is 50/50 sugar/water.  And to make matter even worse, my lightweight drink was $10 and I think the others were either $8 or $10 for single shots of liquor.  A quick google check on several recipes showed me how BAD their drinks are.\n\nThe food was much better fortunately, my \"Taste of NO\" was a solid 3-3.5 stars, but VERY light on the meat,  and my buddy's beef po boy and gumbo was at least that, although our server couldn't remember to bring a spoon for his soup.  The Mahi-mahi was \"excellent\" (and well portioned) but the fried catfish wasn't near as good as Oceana.

I didn't have a list beforehand so I went to my trusty Yelp app. We were famished after going to the Aquarium and walking the downtown area so were really looking forward to some good eats. I ordered a dozen raw oysters to share with the kiddo. It was his first time and he actually enjoyed it. I haven't tasted oysters so fresh in such a long time that I was literally on cloud 9. They had all the fixings and sauces...the way it should be served. In retrospect, we should have gotten 2 dozen :-D\n\nThe kid ordered the burger; we were both really impressed with the flavor and quality. The hamburger patty had a crust that lent to a crispy char on the outside and a perfectly medium juicy burger.  I ordered the seafood pasta in a garlic cream sauce.

For less than $20, you can taste three New Orleans staples-- jambalaya, gumbo, and \u00e9touff\u00e9e. \n\nAn extra plus is that the restaurant has amazing lighting for food photos!", "date": "2015-02-07 02:01:51"}

The crab claws was another winner! The sauce was absolute bliss. We kept swooping up that sauce with the bread. Yummaayy...\n\nThe redfish entree was recommended by our waiter and it was definitely different and somewhat of a \"healthy\" alternative or break from all that shellfish. It was very tasty with bold cajun flavors. Unfortunately it tastes almost exactly like something I made at home before so I wasn't exactly blown away by its uniqueness. Nonetheless it was delicious. The sauce of the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e was pretty good but much lighter in seafood taste than I had expected. I wasn't crazy about the crawfish being fried like that because not only were the crawfish small enough, but the batter was quite plain therefore those little nuggets just taste like your typical fried stuff.

Came in around 9:30 pm and were seated promptly, however, we were seated between the kitchen and the bathroom with about one foot of space for servers and patrons to move past, which resulted in people literally stepping on us.  Fortunately we were re-seated.  We ordered the crab claws and spinach dip to start.  Crab claws were excellent, great flavor.  Spinach dip was, well, pretty much the same spinach dip you could get anywhere.  For entrees we got the crawfish etoufee (sp?) and shrimp and grits.  Neither dishes blew me away with flavor and were in fact a bit too spicy for me and I like spicy food.  The reason for the three stars is 1. The food wasn't as good as it could have been imo.  The flavor of both entrees could have been kicked up a notch and 2. It took over an hour to get our food AND appetizers, which for the simplicity of the dishes is too long.", "date": "2015-03-15 00:03:41"}

Their \"signature\" Hurricanes are terrible compared to the real thing but the Bloody Mary's are alright though not spicy compared to others in the city.  Fish and chips are enough to split, hush puppies are good (when they are warm), and oysters are large.  They hurry you through which is why the wait is short.  The best thing about RH is the discount for locals.  An easily fixable maintenance issue needs to be addressed by RH.  All three times we have been there, one of the toilets in the ladies room has been out of order, overflowing or running.  Just generally broken.  Wouldn't think that it's a random problem because I have never seen it in working order.  Last time, annoyed at the wait, I fixed it myself.

At $10 each, just stuck with water after that. \n\nThe one star is for our server Diego who noticed the hubby's discontent with the food & sent the manager over to make things better. Manager insisted on giving us free dessert. Opted for the bananas foster cheesecake which WAS really good & the high point of our meal, but once again we waited about 40 minutes for it, we were literally about to walk out because we thought they had forgotten about it. \n\nOverall: Just bad.

It certainly made lunch more exciting. The view from the balcony was awesome, and the music was even better. A street band was performing on Royal Street, and it was like we had VIP seats to the performance. The previous day, we had gone to a \"jazz brunch\" at Mr B's Bistro where we only ended up hearing a few songs. This was way better! We got to listen to a full performance and see all of the people dancing on the street to the music. \n\nRoyal House has a check-in deal on Yelp, so that if you check in, you get a free appetizer (up to $10) with the purchase of two entrees. We ordered the spinach dip with chips for our appetizer. For our main course, we had the crispy fried fish platter and the Taste of New Orleans platter which included gumbo, crawfish etouffee, and jambalaya. \n\nThe spinach dip was really tasty, and did I mention it was free? The Taste of New Orleans platter had just the right amount of each dish. The star of the dish was the etouffee. It was rich, hearty, and had some good spice to it. The gumbo was really flavorful, and the jambalaya was just okay. The crispy fried fish was light and crispy, and the fish tasted really fresh. The flavor was really elevated by adding some Louisiana hot sauce to the fish. \n\nOur service was excellent. I already talked about the awesome host, and our server was just as good. She was friendly and had a great sense of humor. \n\nWe really enjoyed our lunch at Royal House and would highly recommend it to anyone exploring the French Quarter.", "date": "2015-03-29 02:09:41"}

Had to wait a bit to be seated - even at 9:30pm on a Sunday. Just walk halfway down the street and grab a drink from the lil beer and frozen drink stand and time will go a little faster while standing in line.\n\nThey sent us to be seated upstairs on the balcony. After reading y'all's reviews I was hoping for just that. The seating process seemed a bit disorganized but the upstairs hostess was nice. Place was packed. Our server (Diego maybe?) was great. Friendly and knew his menu. The bf had one of the best bloodies I have ever tried. I almost got my own but just couldn't do it after the whirlwind of travel - I was already delirious and also dehydrated - but I regret not ordering one myself. Wish I had one now. It came garnished with a pickled green bean, celery, olive and onion. So good.\n\nEverything is a little slow going.\nDrinks came slow, apps came really slow - like maybe 40 minutes, but Diego came to keep us updated. I get it - in a place like that the kitchen gets backed up sometimes. Despite our hunger we were really enjoying the night air and some good music as there were two ladies playing on the corner below - A violinist and guitar player. It was like having a free show. \n\nFor apps we had the spinach dip and the Crab Louis Salad. Dip was ok. Came with what seemed to be house made tortilla chips. The portion was a bit small. The salad was good. It sounds a little strange, kind of a weird combination of things but it works. The dressing was really good too and they gave just the perfect amount. \n\nFor our mains my boyfriend had the taste of New Orleans which consists of Gumbo, jumbalaya, & \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Neither one of us are big seafood eaters so he was taking a chance here. He liked the jumbalaya and loved the \u00e9touff\u00e9e, but thought the gumbo had a strange flavor. He described it as tasting of vodka. Who knows? It's New Orleans, maybe it is made with vodka and maybe it's supposed to be. I tried it and tasted vodka as well but it was also reminiscent of something else and had a smokiness to it.\n\nI decided to be a weirdo and order a shit ton of sides as my main course. When I was looking at the menu on yelp it had all of these things listed under Lagniappe...stupid me I thought it was like a combination plate which I felt was perfect because I'm a glutton and usually want one of everything. So I had my heart set on that only to get there and realize that this was a list of the available side dishes. Since I had my heart set on it already I ordered the red potatoes; the slaw; the corn maque choux; the jumbalaya; and hush puppies.\n\nEverything was really good. The hush puppies were the best I've ever had. Slaw was good but different from any I've ever had. It is made with apples and I also tasted some cinnamon in there. It was good but a little sweet for my taste. This was my first time ever trying jumbalaya. It was delicious. Also my first time having maque choux. The corn was a little over cooked but I liked this dish as well. Kind of like a combination of corn and New England clam chowder cuz it definitely had a seafood flavor in there. My favorite thing was the red potatoes. Swimming in butter, garlic and Parmesan cheese. Flavor got a bit intense as I got to the bottom where all the sauce collected. Not healthy in the slightest but oh very delish.\n\nI heard a server tell the table next to us that they sold out of the banana foster cheesecake. I was pretty bummed because I had my heart set on that. Oh well I'm developing a tire around my waist on this trip anyway. \n\nAll in all it was a great nite but I've deducted stars for the cleanliness factor, or lack thereof...\nI know this spot sees crazy volume but the carpets and walls were gross, as well as the bathroom. Replace that stairway carpet with some tile and get someone on bathroom duty. The dingy-ness made me wonder how clean /not clean the kitchen was....", "date": "2015-05-04 23:30:16"}

We chose bar seating and glad we did because we ended up socializing with the bartender/oyster-preparer (Lawrence, I believe his name is) and met some people both to the right and left side of us that we had commonalities with. Lawrence was so nice and when we asked him for recommendations, he first gave us char-broiled oysters with different flavoring for each (I forgot what they're called) because he thought it would be a good starter for people who don't really eat oysters. They were definitely delicious, but we honestly wanted raw oysters so we can control the amount of spices we wanted to put on it and slurp the oysters away! ;) So we ordered a half rack of raw oysters! So good that I almost choked on one of them as I slurped it lol then we had ordered a combo plate of Jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and some other stew-like bowl that was smoked.

(Now, I am by no means an oyster connoisseur, but I am a huge fan of them and eat them every chance I get, and I have never, ever seen one with the bad-tasting black gunk in them like these.) I told Chris that I found it really unusual, and he again repeated his lecture. Perhaps he was just trying to offer some explanation, but I found his tone to be extremely condescending, and his stubborn refusal to acknowledge the possibility of my concern being legitimate was very disrespectful.\n\nAt this point I asked to speak to the manager, Lisa, who was actually really nice and offered to change the oysters. We declined, as we needed to leave soon, but we appreciated that she  actually came up with a solution instead of just trying to tell us that there wasn't a problem like Chris and his other colleague did repeatedly.\n\nOther food was fine: gumbo was bland but not offensive, shrimp po' boy was decent and salad was fresh. The hurricane was way too sweet, but the bloody Mary was actually quite nice. However, with so many dining options in New Orleans, I don't think \"fine\" is good enough to stay competitive, and I wouldn't recommend Royal House to anyone. We went to Commander's Palace later that day and had an awesome experience (separate review later!)", "date": "2015-05-23 04:33:08"}

Creepy! \n\nThe reception was held in an upstairs dining room conveniently with a bar.  There is also a wrap around balcony, good for people watching. Although the balcony is a bit narrow and leans a bit. If you're afraid of heights, be wary. lol\n\nThe food was served buffet style with a good variety of New Orleans cuisine such as crawfish etouffee, gumbo, redfish, dirty rice, and bread pudding. My favorite of the night was definitely the etouffee. I had five bowls of the etoufee over rice. \n\nI also was able to order some oysters from the bar and have them brought up. I was not able to try oysters from anywhere else on my trip to compare, but the oysters at Royal House were great! The Gulf oysters were a good size, not too big or too small and meaty. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bill was only $13 for a dozen... I could have put away another four dozen, but I did not want to spew out oysters all over Bourbon street as there was a four hour open bar that night.... \n\nService at the reception was very friendly and prompt. It seems that people have experienced different service according to other reviews.

I had looked at the menu online and it sounded good, but when I approached the restaurant there was a guy out front shouting out menu items and trying to get customers to come in.  That made me super nervous - usually those are tourist traps and the food is horrible!  Not the case here.  \n\nThe location is great - the upstairs seating is a little bleak but some paint would change that. The outdoor patio has such a great view.  And there is AC and ceiling fans.  The downstairs is fantastic, cute and nice to sit at the bar.  \n\nThe oyster shucker/server/bartender that helped me (Jeffrey) was so friendly - offered tips about the city, what to do and what not to eat!  The oysters there were amazing.  I ordered char-grilled oysters once or twice a day - basically every restaurant that served them.  Royal House is BY FAR the best (better than a few high end restaurants and some other local 'oyster bars').  The oysters are simple - butter, parmesan, maybe some garlic, a lemon and french bread on the plate and they are boiling in the shell.  Delicious and not overdone.  \n\nJeffrey told me to watch out because apparently some places in the area buy oysters buy the gallon bucket and buy shells and serve them.  GROSS!  He pulled out a bag of oysters that were delivered when I was sitting there and shucked them in front of me, served me some on the half shell right there and sent more off to the kitchens to be char grilled.  That's fresh and that's service.  \n\nI ate there twice during my trip and it was a huge mistake not eating there more.  \n\nI would have given them 5 stars, but I think the guy out front could be a turnoff for some people and it needs a little decorative appeal upstairs.", "date": "2015-06-11 04:01:25"}

I tried it and although I thought that it had a nice airy, light taste, it needed some salt and pepper. Everything here is just very one-note, not much development of flavor. The service was also average. Took a long time to get our food and it was a Monday night, not even that busy. We were waiting so long that we asked for some bread to hold us over. They looked surprised & they brought out some bread that (like everything else) was tasteless. Obviously, they don't serve bread baskets often. The waiter also forgot to bring butter with it. My advice would be to save your money and your time and head somewhere worth your while.", "date": "2015-07-02 19:11:37"}

I'm so happy that we picked this place because it was exactly what we were looking for. A happy change of pace from the madness of Bourbon Street, a somewhat elegant/classy yet laid back and approachable place to dine for dinner. Something about the ambiance was very classic to me. I wish I could say we ordered alcohol here, but the aftermath of many hurricanes left me yearning for a ginger ale, so I did that. We started with fried alligator which was excellent and perfectly cooked. I ordered a side of gumbo hoping it would settle my stomach, it was OK but the odor was really strange, almost like BO! It made it difficult to eat, got about half way through. I ordered shrimp and grits, and I have to say it was the best shrimp and grits that I have EVER tasted! Nothing compares to the creaminess of these grits and the delicious jumbo shrimp on top. I sadly had to get rid of the last bit of it because I was just too full and still 'woozy' from Mardi Gras madness! But, I always brag about this dish to anyone who asks about our trip to NOLA and I'm hoping some day I can get back and try it again! My boyfriend had the sampler which featured crawfish etouffee and jambalaya. I normally do not like either of these dishes and they were AMAZING when I tried them at Royal House, leaving me open to wanting to try them at different restaurants.

After the waiter brought the plate he never returned to check on our table unless I flagged him down. The waiter was very inattentive and I spent most of my time trying to get his attention.  He had one table on the balcony that he continued to cater to.  I was facing the balcony and he was in & out numerous times but never looked our way.  I had to ask another waiter to bring water twice.  Then no one ever returned to pick up our plates after we had finished our meals.  I waited 10 minutes before I flagged down yet another waiter to remove the plates so we could relax and finish our bottle of wine.  The manager finally come over and I voiced our concerns over the bad service.  He was very nice & apologetic and comped the price of the bottle of wine.  We did appreciate that the manager was sincerely concerned about our experience.  I would give them another chance but with another waiter.", "date": "2015-07-15 02:08:44"}

Delicious. \n\nLater, my entree, Taste of New Orleans, arrived. There were three small/tall cups filled with different flavors. Two gumbos and one Jambalaya rice (?) with sausage.

My father and I wanted to be adventurous and try to the Alaskan crab boiler pot. \n\nTHIS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE AS WE WERE TOLD. The Alaskan crab boiler \"pot\" had one half of a corn, four legs of crab, and two potatoes. \n\nAre you kidding me? This is a boiler pot! Fill it with some more corn (this is hella cheap anyways) other than one measly half cob. Add some crawfish, some mussels, shrimp or anything to fill the emptiness of the pot.

And boy were we glad! We added our name to this list and anxiously awaited for our name to be called so we can get some good food! \n\nWe waited only like 20mins (thank God!) and we were seated... Upstairs, like ROYALty! :) (see what I did there?! Lol) As soon as we got seated, the most pleasant and amazing server, September, came over to help us. She was so wonderful and extremely informative and helpful with our ordering, and also recommended delicious entree options. Of course, when you're traveling out of state, you ALWAYS take the servers recommendation -- and September was awesome! She recommended the Crawfish Ravioli (which I ended up ordering and was absolutely finger-licking good), and the gumbo, and a few other dishes. \n\nTo start, we went with Fried Alligator -- 'cause when in New Orleans, you GOTTA have 'gator. For entrees, we ordered the Shrimp Creole, Taste of New Orleans, and of course I ordered the Crawfish Ravioli.\n\nWhen our food came, our mouths began salivating just from the smell. Once the food was on our table, all it took was one bite, and wowza -- our tastebuds were having a party of their own; all the flavors went together so nicely, with just the right touch of Cajun spiciness. It was incredible! So flavorful and tasty, absolutely finger-licking good (but don't worry, we ate with our utensils, not our fingers.) I, for one, had never had crawfish before either, and I almost ate the entire portion (couldn't though 'cause it was quite a lot of food.) I now understand why people LOVE Louisiana cookin'... It was awesome! And they definitely don't skimp on that \"Southern Hospitality\". Thank you, September, for being such an awesome server, and making our experience in New Orleans unforgettable!", "date": "2015-08-16 19:19:28"}

I ordered the caprese salad and the shrimp on it was not cleaned and the tomatoes still had the green part in the middle. The person I was with, ordered the oyster duo. He said they tasted good but when he went to eat one of them, there were little bits of shell in it and he ended up throwing that up in his napkin and became pretty embarrassed and didn't touch anything after that. But I want to reiterate that our server was awesome and I didn't have the heart to tell him about the sub par food after we had been such problems. I think that normally they are pretty on point because the flavor was great. It was just the fine details that made our experience not so great.

The food was amazing, the service was great and I loved the atmosphere of the place! \n\nWe were seated immediately around noon in the surprisingly empty restaurant and were overwhelmed with the menu. The waiter helped us through it and told us some of the most popular dishes (all of which were brought up in reviews on Yelp already). We ended up getting the Crab Claws, the Chargrilled Oysters, the Royale Oysters and the Taste of New Orleans paired with two Sam Adams. \n\nThe oysters were probably the best I've ever had. They were super fresh and seasoned amazingly. At first I thought the chargrilled oysters were too much because of the amount of sauce/cheese but I scooped some of it off and it was PERFECT. The Royale oysters were cooked to perfection and went reallyw well with the seafood topping. I highly recommend pairing these with beers because we really enjoyed it.\n\nThe crab claws came out next and despite the rave reviews it got on Yelp, I wasn't impressed. It was barely warm enough and bland compared to the rest of the food. By itself the flavor wasn't bad but it just paled in comparison. We also didn't think it was that fresh because it didn't seem warm enough and it was in that awkward maybe-it's-supposed-to-be-crispy-or-maybe-not phase. \n\nThe taste of New Orleans was above average in my eyes. I LOVED the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e and kinda wished I got that by itself. The jambalaya was also good with nice flavors but a little dry. And finally the gumbo wasn't bad. I liked it but it wasn't mind-blowing. This dish would probably get a 3.5/5 for me. \n\nHowever, the service was awesome and the oysters made the trip worth it. I would definitely recommend coming here!!\n\nUpdate: we couldn't stop talking about the oysters and ended up coming back the next day for more!! \n\nWe got the Rockefeller oysters and the second grilled oysters (forgot the name - starts with an M?) Just as good as we remembered. Each oyster has its own unique flavor and seasoning but they're all cooked to perfection. \n\nIf I could, I would just come here for the oysters.

The parmesan is perfectly baked and bubbling and taste amazing. The oysters here are also very fresh and delicious. I personally actually like ACME's chargrilled oysters a little bit more, but my boyfriend likes them better here, so it's really pretty comparable. The raw oysters were also good, and they are bigger than the ones we are used to eating back in California. They're also saltier than the ones we're used to back in the bay. We also got the crawfish cakes, which were fine. They were a bit salty and dense. I would probably have preferred a different appetizer instead.\n\nI got the Taste of New Orleans, which was yummy. It comes with 3 cups: Jambalaya, Seafood Gumbo and Crawfish Etouffee. I didn't like the gumbo much; it had a weird, bitter aftertaste. The Jambalaya was very good. The rice was very aromatic and flavored very well and not dry at all. The Crawfish Etouffee was by far my favorite of the 3. It's super well seasoned and very tasty. If I came back I would get the etouffee with a side of Jambalaya.\n\nMy boyfriend got the blackened redfish because of the yelp reviews raving about it. If you like fish, you should get this!

They seated us right away!\n\nThe atmosphere was very \"old school\" N'awlins, and packed full of happy people. That means that it's kind of loud, but we scored a corner table downstairs so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.\n\nWe started off with cocktails from their promotional menu (a Citrus Vodka Something-or-Other) and they were potent and delicious. We ordered Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer, I had the Seafood Pescatore for my entr\u00e9e, and my husband had the blackened Redfish with veggies and potatoes.\n\nNeither of us had ever had Oysters Rockefeller before and we'll probably never get them again. They were fine, I guess, but next time I'll stick to getting them raw, or fried and put into a po'boy. My husband really enjoyed his Redfish with veggies and potatoes. He cleaned his plate! I was a bit less than thrilled with my Seafood Pescatore. The shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops were fine but I didn't care for the marinara sauce. It was too sweet. I wasn't happy that I got just two medium sized scallops, and one of the clams and one of the mussels didn't open during cooking.\n\nSo, while it wasn't a terrible meal, I just can't see any compelling reason to return given that there are so many fabulous places in NOLA to experience. *shrug*", "date": "2015-09-09 00:44:49"}

They were also really generous with the amount of the shrimp in their dishes.", "date": "2015-09-12 03:10:31"}

I called about 10 minutes prior asking about the wait to which the lady replied with \"10 minutes\". Once we arrived the hostess informed, \"we cannot make accurate wait times because the staff does not know\". We ended up waiting 15 minutes when there was no wait line present.\n\nStreet parking is rough, especially in NOLA. If you're having a hard time for parking, I'd recommend valet parking in a hotel nearby. The small restaurant has two floors. On the first floor, there is a full bar in the middle of the restaurant against a wall, with the restaurant surrounding the bar. We got seated first floor, and our waiter arrived promptly.\n\nAs a fellow Yelper to another Yelper, do not forget to check in. Although it states \"free appetizer\", the check in coupon is only worth $10 off any appetizer.\n\nFood:\n**Note: A Texas native, I was disappointed at the food portions. So happy everything is bigger in Texas ;)**\nFried Alligator (3/5, Marinated gator meat served with cocktail and tartar sauce): When in NOLA, you gotta 'gator. If you never tried alligator, it literally tastes like chicken but more fatty. Sizes were like mini popcorn chicken pieces. Frankly, I prefer the alligator I've tried in Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. If I do come again, I'd use the check in coupon for the Crab Claws!\n\nChargrilled Oysters (2/5, Plump Louisiana oysters, fresh shucked, topped with our Parmesan butter cheese filling and then grilled to bubbly perfection): I've had better chargrilled oysters than Royal House's. These were disappointing, and we ordered 2 orders of these. It was inconsistent and dry. For some, you can still taste the oyster, but the others I tried tasted like straight up cheese.\n\nBlackened Shrimp Jambalaya (3/5, A classic New Orleans rice dish. Chicken and andouille sausage saut\u00e9ed with peppers and onions, then topped with blackened shrimp): This was probably the best out of the other 2 main courses we ordered. Pretty good flavor to me with good texture in the rice. Rice was not that wet/soggy texture. My friend mentioned she tried much better jambalaya though.\n\nOyster Pasta (2/5, Linguine pasta tossed with spinach and mushrooms in a scampi sauce and topped with fried oysters): My friend ordered this and probably came out 5+ minutes after we received the other two dishes. This was probably my least favorite because it was salty and dry to me. It gets a star for the 8 fried oysters though.\n\nShrimp Creole (3/5, Tender Gulf shrimp saut\u00e9ed with peppers and onions in a spicy Creole tomato sauce served over a bed of steamed white rice): It was my first time trying Shrimp Creole. I'll say that I wasn't head over heels for it. It's tasty though with a good amount of flavor, which is not spicy like it was advertised. There were plenty of shrimp in this dish that I couldn't finish some. My friends ate them though!\n\nApparently, you get a 15% discount if you're a local. Service was \"eh\". Our waiter was friendly, but food took a while and didn't come out one after another. We had to wait for our friend to get the Oyster Pasta. \n\nMy dining experience wasn't the best nor the worst - just \"a-ok\". None of us didn't find an urge to return especially after trying the food because there are other restaurants in NOLA we would love to try.", "date": "2015-09-12 18:03:43"}

Crab claws in themselves are very rich so they don't require a lot of creams and other spices to live in them up. They are delicious just with a little butter garlic salt pepper and chopped up chives. My Caprese salad did not have any basil on it. They do not make capris a salad with basil. They make it with Rosemary. An odd combination. My husband had the crab Louis  salad. Highly recommend that you have it with fresh crab and the Caesar dressing.

The grits was ok,  not too buttery, if you want more butter then you'll need to add it. Not salty, perhaps to balance the sauce. What I ended doing was adding the crab claws sauce into part of the grits without the creole sauce. Because of the unfreshness of the ammonia-metallic tasting shrimp and overwhelming saltiness of the creole sauce I have to give it 1/5 star since the key star was the shrimp.

The food was pretty good and one of the better ones in the French Quarter. She made her suggestions on beer and cocktails. Andygator beer was a good suggestion and was pretty good! The Avion Berry Rita cocktail was served in big glass and was very strong! You should try this too.\n\nOf course, we had to try them chilled oysters and charbroiled oysters. Both were very good and oysters were not grainy with sand from the shell. We had French onion soup, redfish beignets, crawfish ravioli, alligator snacks, shrimp & grits, and shrimp creole. All very good but nothing spicy as I thought Cajun was supposed to carry a little heat? The redfish beignets was too breaded but fish was not overdone. It was sweet n tangy. I really liked the alligator bites appetizer as it tastes like chicken and was very moist. It was not a disappoint.\n\nWe did get the banana cheesecake and it was good and uniquely presented with crust in the shape of a triangle standing sideways. I thought it was round balls of ice cream but it was the banana cheesecake and also served with whip and fruits. You have to order this!\n\nWe ordered dessert the next night when we were craving dessert. We ordered more oysters and peel-n-eat shrimp. The shrimp was just ok. We ordered bread pudding and chocolate ala mode or something like that. Both desserts we're good but nothing special. Overall, 4.5 stars for me as this is one of the better restaurants here. I just wish they had more heat in their spices if they consider this cajun!", "date": "2015-09-29 06:15:55"}

I'm pretty sure I've had food that was possibly slightly spoiled that was better than that garbage atrocity of a sandwich. \nJust thinking about it infuriates me. \n\nChargrilled Oysters are NOT chargrilled. No wood is involved. They are cooked on their gas stove and then smothered to absolute hypertension induced death with Parmesan, which, when combined with the existing brine of the oysters themselves, equate to salt on top of salt. Terrible doesn't quite describe the experience with justice.\n\nAs for the raw oysters, they were old, with no movement at all when lemon was spritzed over them. The waitress had never heard of mignonette sauce and was surprised I asked for something she knew nothing about (I'm pretty sure I was more surprised at her surprise than she was). \nYou're better off skipping these too.\n\nThe crab claws were salty and tiny, average at best. The toast that came with it were microwaved to oblivion, more of like a gigantic stale breadcrumb than any kind of toast I've ever had.\n\nThe prominent flavor profile at Royal House is salt, to the point of where I wonder if the kitchen staff all had terrible colds that annihilated their tastebuds.\n\nMy crawfish etouffee was the only reason why I give them 0.5 stars more, but in all honesty, almost anything would have been better than the fiasco listed above. (as in, I would rather eat at Mcdonald's than eat here again) The sauce of the etouffee was pretty tasty, but the fried crawfish were disgusting. As a matter of fact, if you see anything fried on their menu, avoid it like you avoid that awkward clingy \"friend\" that you happen to see at social gatherings. Quickly, with zero hesitation, and no remorse. \nIf you have a business engagement that requires you to eat here, then go with their grilled seafood options, or get the crawfish etouffee with extra crawfish instead of fried crawfish. \n\nActually, just do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant altogether.

The \"tacos\" came first - slightly fried oysters with slaw and a dollop of tangy hot sauce on top of a nacho chip. Not sure how this counts as a taco, otherwise good starter. Next was the Taste of New Orleans: a trio of classic NOLA dishes accompanied by three wedges of bread. Jambalaya was very good, especially with some hot sauce; Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e was a bit overpowering on the salty end, but great with the bread; Seafood Gumbo was forgettable.

I've worked in the restaurant business in the past for over 10 years. I know everything from front and back of the house operations. Needless to say we were highly disappointed. From the service to the food, everything we had was sub par. We didn't have a waiter, so the bar tender had to give us service. He seemed to be in the weeds, so I gave him a pass since I know how that is sometimes. We sat on the balcony, which wasn't as nice as expected considering the tables and chairs were slanted. It was very uncomfortable, felt unsafe, and we had to constantly watch our drinks and food to make sure they didn't spill over. \n\nI started off with a half dozen of raw oysters, oyster duo and a Old Fashion cocktail. The raw oysters didn't taste as fresh as I've had at other places. The cocktail sauce or whatever they call it was nothing but ketchup with a side of horseradish. The ice chilling the oysters was halfway melted and was spilling over into my oysters. The oyster duo was a little better but the breading/stuffing was over powering the oyster. Way too much stuffing on them. After completing our appetizers I still had not received my cocktail which was around $12. Once received it was brought to me in a plastic cup you'd receive in some club, not in a rocks glass. I had to request a silverware replacement twice because there were noticeable food stains on my knife and forks. Now that I'm on the utensils, why would any self respecting restaurant serve their guests cheap, scratched utensils? Looks like they purchased them from Dollar General. The plastic drinking cups were gross as well. Your prices are not cheap but you put out cheap looking utentils? \n\nI ended up ordering the rib-eye and my wife had the crawfish ravioli. I ordered my rib-eye med, and it came out med-well. The potatoes were good, but my green beans were cold. If I'm paying almost $30 for a steak, I expect it to be cooked to my expectations. The ravioli wasn't impressive either. It tasted like something I could have gotten at Olive Garden. After all was said and done, we spent good money at this place and it was not well deserved. The royal house has a good menu, but they need a makeover in the front and back of the house.", "date": "2015-11-12 18:17:13"}

I was happy to find a highly reviewed restaurant open on a federal holiday so I spent my thanksgving dinner at Royal House. This restaurant is located in the French Quarter so parking is very hard to find but you can always pay for parking at various garages in the area and walk over. There was a short line on this night but out wait was only about 15 minutes. \n\nI was looking forward to the chargrilled oysters since this is a New Orleans specialty. I've had it this dish before at two other very highly reviewed restaurants in the French Quarter. I was very disappointed in Royal House's version of chargrilled oysters for one very important reason: size. A dozen oysters was 20 dollars so this dish does cost quite a bit so I expected some juicy oysyers but the size of each specimen was disappointingly about the size of an almond. I've never seen chargrilled oysters so small and all 24 of the ones we had were all tiny. The competition in the french quarter served oysters that quadrupled the size for the same price and in the same season as I visited those restaurants on the following night. \n\nWe also ordered the blackened redfish, chicken sandwich, redfish beignet, and oyster pastry. The highly revered blackened redfish was ok, nothing too special. The chicken sndwich was ok. The oyster pastry and redfish beignet were very unique and tasty. The redfish beignet was covered in a sweet sauce. The shell was very crispy. Unlike a typical beignet which is square and has a dough filling, the redfish beignet was a long and slim rectangle with a fish filling. The oyster pastry was small but very tasty. \n\nThere is a yelp check in offer for a free appetizer. No stipulations were mentioned on the yelp page for check in but our server informed us that we would only get a 10 dollar credit and that we needed to order two entrees. The chargrilled oysters do not count as an entree even though the cost exceeds many other qualified entrees and by a huge amount on some selections. I don't undetstand this logic. \n\nTwo stars overall for this establishment. The price doesn't justify the experience.", "date": "2015-11-28 08:21:05"}

Fresh warm oysters topped with parmesan butter cheese, great starter to open up the stomach.\n+Crab Claws: I already had my eyes set on this dish after reading reviews and seeing pictures. It exceed my expectations as I didn't know what to expect. The lemon garlic butter sauce reminds of a crab bisque consistency, but the real winner here is the crab claws themselves! These tiny succulent crab claws really soaked up the flavor of the sauce, could not get enough of them! Highly recommend this appetizer!\n+Blackened Redfish (w/ Crabmeat): Tina recommended saving some of the crab claw sauce to place on top of the redfish. This was a tip she provided since an additional $4 would be charged if we ordered it with the dish. Definitely thankful for her suggestion! The sauce was exactly the thing needed to top of the dish.

I'm not sure how it had escaped my attention for so long given the extensive and excellent reviews. \n\nIf compared to Commanders Palace or Antoine's, Royal House is not going to blow you away with innovative New Orleans cuisine. This is a solid, delicious and nice place to experience the cuisine that makes NOLA famous in their most traditional form. There is ONE thing that sets Royal House apart: the charbroiled oysters. I don't like oysters normally, but these are a clear exception. They are fresh (we saw them being brought in to the restaurant by the cart loads), grilled over a charcoal fire, and smothered in melted butter and parmesan cheese goodness. How can one go wrong with butter and parmesan cheese? \n\nThe grilled scallop salad was a nice large tasty healthy choice, and the shrimp po boy consisted of fresh French bread and a generous portion of fried shrimp (though I like the shrimp batter better at Mother's and Oceana). The rawfish ravioli is a very large dish that should be shared by two people in most cases -- warning: It is RICH and sweet. \n\nWe only had one complaint. It was a very chilly day outside, and the host seated us by the door. A brothel has never seen a door open and shut so many times as it did during our hour lunch. The hosts that would stand outside LOVED to go in and out of the door every 30 seconds, and every damn time, they would leave the door standing wide open -- freezing us to death. It was like every host had ADHD. THEN the oyster folks decided to make a delivery during our lunch, which consisted of at least another 10 trips in and out of the front door (is there seriously no back door?). Ugh. Folks, please be sensitive if you're going to seat customers by the door on a cold day. \n\nOur server was really nice, knowledgeable and engaging. We were seated immediately upon our arrival. The manager came by to make sure that we were having a good experience (which we were except for the swinging saloon door).\n\nOk, enough about the door. The food here is great, and Royal House has earned a place on our list of options for our annual trip. You should try it too.", "date": "2016-01-08 15:21:05"}

Outdoor seating on the balcony, overlooking a beautiful area. They have creole and Cajun cuisine. They have great reviews. Right?\n\nWe arrived on a Saturday afternoon around 1. Behr hostess put our name down for 15-20 minute wait for the balcony. One person was ahead of us. She was friendly and kind. Several people were lining up and didn't want to take the free seats they had inside - they wanted to wait for the balcony.  After 20 minutes a manager walked over and whispered something to the hostess. She offered us a seat inside and said it was going to be another 20 minutes. We were insistent that we wanted the balcony. She kept trying to sell us on an inside seat saying we'd have to wait even more time. We wouldn't budge. Within a second she told us a table was ready on the balcony. Lame tactics to fill tables inside. \n\nWe were seated by another kind staff member. The balcony is scary. It's awesome. But it's scary. It's slanted and not really supported by additional columns under it. We sat on a corner above a dumpster and it smelled like trash the whole time. That's New Orleans I guess. We got to people watch and take in the beautiful day though. We checked in and got a free app. \n\nWe went with the crawfish cakes. They were good but the dish they were served in was dirty and the presentation was poor. They were like mushy cakes of seafood. Nothing to write home about. Nothing too bad.  My husband and I both ordered a half shrimp half fish platter. When the dishes came out (on dirty plates) there were several issues. \n\nA nice long strand of hair accompanied my cole slaw. I immediately found the waiter and sent it back. He was apologetic. As a manager made his way over I realized I didn't get any hush puppies with my dish either. The manager apologized - he offered me a free drink or dessert. I declined - probably the first person in all of New Orleans to turn down a drink. \n\nOur meal was horrible. We would have had a better meal at Popeyes. The batter on our shrimp and fish was thick and bready. There was no flavor. The fries were average frozen French fries. Hush puppies were burnt and tasted like old fryer oil. \n\nEveryone was kind. Everyone was trying to provide good service. Our waiter was nice and friendly. \n\nMan. We were disappointed. The food is seriously lacking and things didn't come together. Forget the hair. I can forgive a mistake. But the food wasn't even worth forgiving it for.

My friend started with a coke and an empty plate (I don't know what his problem was that night, seriously he should have left his issues at the door. I didn't want him to ruin my night) \n\nThe salad was impeccable and onto my main where I had jambalaya and my friend had gumbo. The moment the gumbo touched my friend's lips a smile came to his face that I have never seen since. He said it reminded him of his younger brother Gumbo who drowned in the Mississippi and he often he wished it was the other brother that no one liked. \n\nJeremiah brought my chocolate cake, which was an exquisite way to finish the night as my friend watched. Jeremiah dropped off the bill and asked my companion \"Would you like some more coke, boss?\" My friend smiled and said yes with a tear in his eye. \n\nThe bill was cheaper than I thought it would be, especially for such a refined and cultured establishment. \n\nGo here if you're in NOLA and ask for Jeremiah. I intend to go back one day and ask him out.", "date": "2016-03-10 16:41:52"}

After reading all the reviews and even the line of folks outside I thought for sure we might have found a good spot. Unfortunately the food was AWFUL and the only reason I can give this place any stars was the staff was friendly and the service was good. After a good set of recommendations from the waitress we decided in the chargrilled oysters, redfish beignets, and blackened redfish topped with crab meat (extra cost). Everything, I mean everything, was slathered in at least half a stick of butter. The oysters were greasy with little flavor and lots of oyster shell bits in the sauce, the beignets weren't horrible but super sweat and just tasted like fried fish drenched in honey. The entree of the blackened redfish they forgot the crab extra in top so had to bring it out after the fact. The side veggies for this dish were again all butter and grease :( the blacked redfish was probably the best part of the meal as it wasn't too salt or greasy. Sadly the crab topping was soooo salt and soaked in butter we didn't even eat it. If it wasn't for the friendly welcoming waitress I think I'd give this place zero stars. Save the money and skip this place.", "date": "2016-03-11 21:40:32"}

Part of it came from the oyster, and the guy open the shells does not ware gloves. He also chatted with customers and shake their hand before going back to open more shells. No oysters was on ice before or after the the process. Ice only met oysters 30 second before your table. Lisa A Elfer is the one who signed their health certificate. He also rubs his face with the same hands. Health Alert!!! I am sitting on the high chair for ten minute, and finally get a MENU,covered with unknown liquid. \n\nThe bar is lovely if you can hold your breath. I was not brave enough to order oyster that night after I saw the opened oysters were sitting on the counter without ice.. You are surely braver than I am. I finally ordered fried gator meat, and taste of New Orleans. unlike other places, they could not do the gator meat blacked. I guess seasoning requires more skills and good spies.  I was so glad that I brought my own water since they did not offer any. 17 minutes in water is in front of me now!!!\n\nThe alligator is half the portion compared to what I had this week in other places. It is about $1.50 per bites. You need eat with your hands. Interestingly, the lemon slice amen with it  was covered with shredded cheese. The gator meat is very soft, and soooooo salty. Someone tipped over the salt jar?  Unfortunately, I told the staff that I will have my beer when the dishes arrive. And I never saw my beer that night. \n\nTaste of New Orleans has three cup of, crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, chicken gumbo, and creole. The crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e is well cooked, with plenty of hot spicy taste. The chicken is very good too. It contains chunks of smoked sausage, and enriched with smoky flavor. Chicken meat soaked with the flavor from Cajun, black pepper in the soup is one of the high light. The creole is not among the best in town, dry and lack of ingredient other than rice.", "date": "2016-04-25 02:42:46"}

My dad had the same opinion of his oyster po' boy.  They were very largly portioned and bready.  We did however both really enjoy our red beans and rice.  I could probably live off of red beans and rice though.  My sister had a shrimp po' boy and she said it had a lot more flavor.

For entrees we ordered the seafood boiling pot, shrimp boiling pot, rib eye, fried seafood platter, oyster pasta, and the soup trio. ALL of our entrees lacked so much flavor. My friend probably took 2 bites of her pasta and pushed it aside. The seafood platter was room temperature and just overall mediocre. My friend hated the soup trio and said it tasted nothing like jambalaya, etoufee, or red beans. The boiling pots lacked so much flavor that we expected since we are in New Orleans.. AND they were supposed to come with corn, which we never got. And when I asked my server if it was supposed to come with it she said yes but we probably ran out since it's the end of the night. It would have been nice to have been offered a substitution or be told they were out to begin with. They probably hoped we wouldn't notice. And the rib eye was just ok. We didn't even want to order dessert for our friends birthday. Would probably never come here again since we paid almost $400 for a meal we all werent the least bit satisfied with. And for $400 we never even got a single drink refill. Save your money and go elsewhere. WOULDNT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE", "date": "2016-05-23 20:57:09"}

Everything from the friendly wait staff (a rarity in NOLA believe it or not - we encountered more rude waiters and waitresses during our trip than I could even comprehend), to the wonderful balcony seating, the presentation of the food, and the delicious flavors were well worth the price (which really wasn't too bad).\n\nFor starters, I got the french onion soup, which is one of my favorites... my wife had never had french onion soup, and really isn't a fan of onions, but she was so intrigued upon seeing the crock-full of melty mozzarella covered deliciousness that she had to have a bite. We both enjoyed it a ton and knew we were in for a good meal.\n\nMy wife ordered the fried shrimp po' boy and I ordered the shrimp and grits (we don't get fresh shrimp in Nashville, so we were on shrimp kick). This was my wife's first po' boy experience and I don't quite think she knew what to expect, and consequently found the sandwich pretty boring (not to mention a little dry), but she did say that the flavors were delicious. I had a bite and it did not disappoint. Plenty of shrimp flavor, and a dash of hot sauce mellowed out by the crusty white roll. \n\nThe shrimp and grits, on the other hand, were anything BUT boring!! It was absolutely fantastic. First, they don't do shrimp poured over a bowl of grits like you'd expect, but instead they prep the grits and then form them into grit cakes and FRY them to a delicious golden brown. It was probably one of the more unique preparations of shrimp and grits that I have ever had. No kidding - if you go to Royal House, this is a must-try. The shrimp was prepared in a tangy tomato cream sauce and topped with a little bit of grated parmesan. It had so many layers of texture and flavor - the little bit of chew from the shrimp, the crunchiness from the outside of the grit cake, and the creaminess of the cheesy grit goodness inside. \n\nWe finished off the night with the bananas foster cheesecake, which was outstanding in it's simplicity, but HUGE in its flavors. What else is there to say? Creamy cheesecake filling with what I think was a ginger snap crust, and caramelized bananas - all covered in a delicious caramel sauce. Can't ask for a much better way to end the night.\n\nAll in all, do yourself a favor and check this place out. It's got a great twist on some of the classic New Orleans fare, and I guarantee that you won't leave disappointed. If my wife and I get to go back to NOLA any time soon, you better bet we will be back at Royal House!", "date": "2016-06-03 18:13:20"}

The decor was bright and airy upstairs with the doors to the balcony open looking down on the street. We began with the red fish beignets which were excellent. Then I had the oyster pasta, but I substituted grilled shrimp as I wasn't in the mood for fried anything today. It was just ok - the pasta wasn't particularly fresh and I got a couple of small pieces of shrimp shell in there. The bread that came with it was stale on one side so I asked for more. In general, not a $20 pasta dish. \n\nThe real disaster was my wife's dish. (I don't use that word lightly) She ordered the blackened red fish. The fish was lukewarm and the\ngreen beans were cold. The beans were also limp, flavorless, and colorless. They said they were fresh, but we suspect they were frozen. Or at least cooked for so long they became sad little green ghosts of what they once were. Then there was the fresh crab add-on. Oh my. Dry, flavorless, and cooked beyond what any form of fish should be subjected to. \n\nShe sent the dish back to be warmed up as she didn't want to make a fuss about the other problems. They said they would cook it all over again. But it didn't matter. The new dish was just as bad, and sad. \n\nThe waiter was attentive and asked how it was and we were more specific. He then asked if we could express our concerns to the manager, which we did a few minutes later. They were both very apologetic and were kind enough to comp our desserts and gave us 15% off the whole meal. Classy. \n\nWe understand some nights the kitchen isn't doing well or something's off, but they did the right thing to try to make up for it. It's not about the money to us. It's that they were willing to go beyond apologies and put their money where their mouth is. It says they do care and want to do better by us. After all, it's not a $30 meal we're paying for. We came to New Orleans for the great food, so restaurants have to and should be on their game.\n\nIncidentally, the desserts were great. We also tipped well on the full price without the discounts. The server shouldn't lose for the kitchen's mistakes. I gave 2 stars for the food, but added a third just for the service from the server and the manager.", "date": "2016-06-06 02:37:23"}

The view is lovely even if the titled angle of the balcony is a little jarring when you first get up there. \n\nWhen it comes to the actual food, though, it's another story. I ordered French onion soup as my appetizer and a shrimp po'boy as my main dish with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. My boyfriend got his gumbo, but my soup still had not come by the time the entrees came out. I was assured several times by our waiter that the soup would be out any minute. When it came time to eat the po'boy, I took one bite and immediately knew it was not fresh. The bread was harder than i was expecting and tasted almost stale, which would have been excusable if the shrimp itself had been hot and tasted good. Alas, the shrimp wasn't even lukewarm, and it tasted as if it had been sitting under a lamp or something for quite awhile. The potatoes were good and flavorful, but definitely not hot. I ended up sending back the dish. \n\nFinally, after my boyfriend finished ALL of his food, my French onion soup arrived. I have to say, this actually salvaged the meal for me. It was possibly the best French onion soup I've ever had, with mouth-watering cheese that was crispy in all the right places and a really flavorful broth. The waiter was very accommodating and removed both an appetizer and my main dish from the bill.\n\nI don't think I would come back to the Royal House again. It was probably my least favorite place I ate at while in New Orleans, which is unfortunate because the soup was absolutely fantastic.", "date": "2016-07-11 01:21:59"}

I wasn't big on the gumbo or jambalaya, but I would definitely go for the etouffee again.\n\nReally, just a good, solid restaurant with great food and a good atmosphere.  I see a few people being a bit on this place for being for tourists...\n\n..dude, you're in French Quarter, of course it's for tourists.  It's a touristy section of New Orleans.

Drinks and drink prices were also good. For our entrees, boyfriend got the shrimp poboy and I did the shrimp tortellini. Both we were very satisfied with, although the shrimp didn't seem super high quality  (relatively small and were certainly frozen for some time). But it didn't detract much from the taste too much. Boyfriends poboy was also loooaded with shrimp, which was nice considering lots of places around give you barely a handful.  Could've used more sauce, but that's a very easily remedied personal preference (wait staff was very prompt in grabbing us a touch more).  \n\n\nOverall, prices seem right for quality of food, very good food and service, and great ambiance.

However, don't let that deter you from coming to eat here. We began with the crab claws appetizer (which we received free by checking in on Yelp -- thanks Yelp!). Our waitress recommended them and although at first we almost didn't go with them, we are glad we did. The claws come ready to eat and covered in a lemon butter sauce with garlic bread. The sauce is so great that we wiped the plate completely clean. I would say this appetizer is the perfect size for two people.\n\nWe also shared charbroiled oysters with Parmesan and lemon drizzled on top. These oysters are a must try and will leave you wanting more. We got a dozen for two people and six definitely left us wanting more. The oysters were large and fresh and just the right amount of flavor. \n\nWe then ordered the New Orleans Sampler which comes with a cup of jambalaya, craw fish etouffee, and gumbo. We ordered a side of red beans and rice to try it as well. These portion are a little less than a cup so you'll get to try it all. If I had to come back and order again though I would have only gotten the drafish etouffee and the red beans and rice. Those were by far the two best dishes in the sampler. \n\nFinally we caved in and decided to try the bread pudding for dessert. It was deliciously warm and came with ice cream on top. Definitely the perfect way to end this meal.\n\nI would say if you're coming to visit 1. don't forget to check in for the free appetizer and 2. order food to share! Royal House has so many great options that you'll want to try as much as you can. \n\nCan't wait for our next visit to Royal House!", "date": "2016-08-26 17:44:48"}

That crystal beurre blanc sauce and cane syrup was so good and the beignets were so light and flavorful. For my entree, I got the pecan crusted mahi mahi, also at his suggestion. Once again, incredible crystal lemon butter cream sauce. So delicious. Finally, we finished with the bananas foster cheesecake. It's a deconstructed cheesecake but boy is it good. The cheesecake is so light and fluffy. The homemade cinnamon graham cookie is perfect - and there's a ton for people who love extra crust. The whipped cream was also delicious.

White tablecloths and nice place settings add to the classiness of the place, but you could still dress pretty casual here.\n\nEvery waiter/waitress interaction we had and witnessed at Royal House was pleasant - everyone was extremely friendly. I ordered the Crawfish Ravioli and my boyfriend had the Seafood Pescatore. All I can say is WOW. My ravioli was delicious - perfectly cooked pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese embedded in a creamy, spice-filled crab and crawfish sauce, with even more cheese on top. I was in heaven! My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his dish as well, but gobbled it down before I could snag a bite. His pasta was topped with plentiful seafood: scallops, mussels, clams, and shrimp, and tossed in a yummy red sauce.\n\nI wish we could say we had room for dessert, but we will definitely be back to Royal House the next visit to the French Quarter and make sure to try their famous Bananas Fosters Cheesecake or Bread Pudding!", "date": "2016-09-17 22:48:19"}

They present themselves as an \"oyster bar\" which is why we went in, though one of my group ordered a blackened chicken sandwich. He said it was mediocre and tasted like 'overpriced bar food.' The other two of us ordered 'fresh Louisiana oysters' and it was not good. First, they don't scrub their oysters. I had silt, goop and muck all over my fingers by the time I finished a half dozen. Putting your mouth up to a dirty oyster shell that came from God knows where is troubling enough, let alone thinking about what manner of aquatic monsters might have come along with it. Beyond that, once shucked, the silt ran into the oyster juice making for a lot of grittiness in your mouth, equally unappealing. Other surprising finds: they shucked oysters but threw out the wrong side of the shell, usually you present the oyster in the deeper \"cup\" not the flatter top shell but several of these came presented incorrectly. One of the oysters had a dark, hard chunk visible to the eye (maybe the beginnings of a pearl? I have no idea WTF it was) and after trying to surgically remove it I told the server I'd like a different one.\n\nOn a side note, I'm used to ocean oysters and I assume these come from a river (or delta) however I've never had oysters with other mollusks growing on the shells - typically you want oysters that come from an area with a healthy exchange of water to deliver nutrients to the oysters. Having other sealife attach and thrive on the oyster shell implies they're not grown in an area of free moving water.\n\nLast note about this place, the server was very inattentive. I think this might just be a New Orleans thing as everyone seems to operate on \"island time\" (for those of you who travel to the Caribbean and know what I mean): it gets done when we get it done and there is no sense of urgency. The couple at the table next to us took over an hour just to get their food and waited 30 more minutes to try to get the check. Overall, miserable place.", "date": "2016-11-05 05:06:47"}

After asking advice on several menu items, she jokingly said \"I'm gonna just order for you!\", I said \"OK!!\". I was not disappointed!! Everything she brought me was very good, but I would have to say the mahi-mahi was my favorite. Definitely planning another stop there on my next trip to NOLA.", "date": "2016-11-07 05:16:48"}

I told the waitress (who was super nice about it) and in the end just changed the entire order bc I was afraid they wouldn't make the replacement right either. The manager came out and tried to explain that it was cooked so I wouldn't worry about getting sick but I know chicken and it didn't taste right.

We finally stopped a manager and asked her to check on our food. She did and told us only five more minutes (on top of the 20 minutes). Five more minutes and no food. I was really hungry and it was not that busy, so I did not want to stay any longer. I asked a second manager for the check because the food never came and I just wanted to pay for the gumbo and go. He asked us what the issue was and I told him our food had not come after waiting so long and our waitress has not come back by, noticing our food had taken a long time. After the second manager, the waitress finally stopped by and still pretended like everything was normal. We told her we were ready to go. The manager finally came, back to our table after the food arrived--which I no longer wanted--to let us know he took care of the gumbo. I'm not sure why he had to make use wait any longer and could not tell us when he first stopped by. The food did look delicious but the service here dropped their ratings all the way down to a one.

Our server was really friendly and gave us a quick rundown of the menu, and we got the crawfish beignet as an appetizer from the checking on Yelp. Apparently the appetizer isn't free like the Yelp check-in says but it's -$10 for whatever appetizer you get. Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food including two platters of oysters, and we then we started waiting. And waiting. After maybe twenty minutes, our first platter of oysters came, closely followed by the second plate. We noticed the second plate wasn't what we ordered so we asked the waiter who took it back. We then waited for another twenty or thirty minutes for our food, and our entrees came. Our oysters never did. We told the waiter and he said there was a mixup and our oysters were given to the table next to us. The manager came by afterward and told us that she'd give us two orders of what we got on the house (too bad I don't really eat oysters). So I ate my crawfish etouffee and it was quite good. A bit salty, but good. Nice spicy flavor and a good amount of crawfish, both fried bits on top and in the sauce. I asked for more bread as well so I could soak up the sauce. I quite enjoyed that dish. When the oysters finally came after we had already all finished our meal (this was probably another 10-15 minutes), the Rockefeller oysters came and I tried one. Way too much cheese on top! Otherwise I think ok as far as oysters go. Then we asked for the check do which also took at least five minutes to get here. My crawfish dish was $17 pre-tax which is a bit pricey, and combined with the mixup and the super long waiting times, I wouldn't suggest coming here. The waiter apologized many times for the mixup which is fine, but it doesn't excuse the super long wait times for our main entrees. To be fair, my food (the crawfish etouffee) was quite good and deserves 4 stars, but the long long long wait and inefficiencies (I'm excusing the mix-up with the oysters because there was a miscommunication which I understand happens - what isn't excusable is how long we waited for our entrees/other dishes, the check, etc etc) subtracted 1 star.", "date": "2017-01-02 13:44:50"}

Would highly recommend this!\n-Taste of New Orleans (Jambalaya, Crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e, and Gumbo): A really good sampling platter of staple NOLA foods. The gumbo was definitely my favorite and helped tone down the spices of the other two. All three foods go very well together and balance out all of the flavors. It also is a good serving size where you will be full, but not uncomfortably so. It's a lot of rice though so be prepared for that, and they also give you three slices of toasted bread to go with it so it's very carb-heavy.\n-Seafood Pescatore: Absolutely delicious. Really good variety of seafood inside of it, nice cream-based sauce, and good portion size as well. It wasn't too heavy or greasy like a lot of other seafood pastas end up being. My friend ordered this and I had a few bites - almost wished I had ordered this instead! \n\nService: 9/10\n-Very fast, accommodating, and friendly.\n-Really decent pricing.\n\nAtmosphere: 7/10\n-Felt a little unclean and smelled a little weird (maybe like...old seafood). \n-Lively and bright inside.\n\nLoved this place, thought the food was very well-seasoned and cooked, and would definitely return again!", "date": "2017-01-04 01:00:13"}

Nice atmosphere, away from the lunacy of Bourbon St. I would eat here again and a) bring my ID, and b) try something different on the menu.", "date": "2017-01-06 22:56:49"}

Wow Yelpers really have this one wrong. I was in New Orleans for a week & ate out 2-3x/day & this is hands down the worst place I ate at during my entire vacation. \nStarted out with chargrilled oysters & oysters royal. The oysters came out lukewarm, cheese on the oysters royal had already coagulated, not \"bubbly\" per the menu. The chargrilled oysters did not have any chargrill flavor at all, it tasted as if they were just baked in the oven. We had chargrilled oysters just the day before & what we had was way better than what we got at Royal House. \nOur entrees included the shrimp jambalaya & the pecan-crusted mahi mahi. I'm sorry but what I got was not mahi mahi nor was it pecan crusted. I don't normally eat fish but when I do I tend to order the mahi mahi because of the mild taste & flaky texture, so I know what mahi mahi tastes like. I was expecting a 2 inch thick filet crusted with noticeable pecan pieces. No, I got a 1/4 inch thin filet that was just battered. I thought I was given the wrong dish that I asked 2 staffers if I got the right dish, of which they said I did. The mahi mahi was the fishiest tasting mahi mahi I had ever had in my life. The batter did not have any pecan taste to it. The \"chef's vegetable\" that came with the dish turned out to be soggy, overly salty green beans that have probably been sitting in a warm brine bath all day. I think the reason why they top the fish with the creamy shrimp sauce is to help hide the fishy taste of the mahi mahi; well it didn't work for me. \n\nTheir bloody mary was also the worst we had in the city - basically tasted like we were drinking Worcestershire sauce straight. \n\nOur waitress probably picked up on my dissatisfaction because she didn't even offer us the dessert menu. I ate as much as I could tolerate then got the heck out of there. I cannot believe the price I paid for that dinner, it was not worth it. \n\nMaybe the chef had a bad night or I just ordered the wrong food. This is my experience and if I ever go to New Orleans again, I will not eat there.", "date": "2017-01-09 08:00:01"}

We arrived around 2 on a Sunday and was promptly greeted and seated. The waitress was dealing with another customer so she told us she would be with us shortly. We looked over the menu and waited for awhile before she returned. I chalked it up to her being a tad busy so i wasn't upset. We had time to look over the menu several times so we went ahead and placed our order, everything from drinks, apps to entree. We settled on the oyster duo with a side of crawfish etoufee and the shrimp platter with a side of gumbo. We also ordered the oyster tacos as a app. \n\nWe were seated on the balcony and we talked as we people watched. The app came fairly quickly and it consistents of 4 taco chips with oyster and slaw on top of them. I don't know how that can be classified as taco not nacho but to each its own. The app was pretty good, although i could taste the grit from the oyster. The overall taste was a good starter. \n\nThis is where the meal goes downhill. We waited for over 40 mins on our meal. I watched a second line come and go. I listened to at least 5 songs from the street performers. I even watched a lady raise money for her little pig. One thing i didn't see was any food coming to my table. We finally asked the waitress how much longer. Her response was let me go downstairs and check. Well low and behold, her comes our meal. \n\nThe oysters were room temp so they must have been sitting there. The etoufee was meh. The gumbo was pretty good and the shrimp platter was so not worth the price. I was so disappointed that i waited for this meal. \n\nUnless i am starving and drunk  and everything else is close i will never be back.

First, the restaurant did not seem clean from the moment we sat down, when there were flies on the table, which was set but did not seem like it had had a good cleaning before being set. Yes, the doors were open and it was warm, but this had been the case at other restaurants we visited this week as well, without flies and a generally dirty vibe. I also ended up asking for a new wine glass, as mine was noticeably dirty (something I do very rarely). We had a couple of appetizers at our table, the fried alligator and seafood stuffed mushrooms, both of which were fine but nothing outstanding. I ordered the shrimp caprese salad, in part because it was the only menu item with the Eat Fit NOLA stamp. Even though the server confirmed my order twice during ordering, the wrong dish was brought to the table. In fairness, they brought me the correct dish quickly, and removed the charge for the dish from our bill. My food was great, but my fellow diners' dishes did not look appetizing, and I'd be hard-pressed to recommend a place where I would only want to order one dish.

They were so accommodating, and we interacted with lots of different waitstaff, all were friendly, eager to help, and quite funny!\n\nSo this evening I got the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e and wife got the Cajun shrimp with peppers and onions in tomato base. We both really enjoyed our entr\u00e9es! It was the first time I've ever had \u00e9touff\u00e9e and it was scrumptious! She enjoyed her as well. We then shared a brownie al a mode for dessert. It wasn't anything super special, but it was quite tasty! It was also a good size to share post-meal.\n\nThe only downside I would say would be the crab leg appetizer. So I got really excited when I saw the free appetizer with a check in. The one appetizer that I had planned to get they were out of, and given the fact that I don't eat pork, beef, or alligator, we went with the crab legs. The flavor was great, don't get me wrong but the dish itself was a nightmare to try and navigate. The crab comes still attached to the little claws. You have to scrape it off little by little. It took my wife so long to get the crab meat off the legs, that her entr\u00e9e showed up before she had finished the appetizer. Also, this method leaves a lot of crab shell fragments in the small pile of crab meat that you worked so hard to accumulate. So don't buy down too hard!

We were seated upstairs right next to the balcony which was adorable! Super cute for an afternoon of people watching. The breeze did pick up during our lunch though so we ended up closing the doors next to our table. Initially I wanted to order a dozen raw oysters (1 dozen for $16) since one of my friends had never had oysters before, but the waitress told me they were known for their charbroiled oysters (1 dozen for $20) and I was sold. Definitely the highlight of our meal. I'm sure it wasn't anything special, but being from out of town, the Louisiana hot sauce that came out with the oysters was pretty good. I'll probably look for it the next time I go grocery shopping. \n\nAs for the rest of our meal, I ordered the crawfish ravioli( $24)which was mouthwatering. The sauce was absolutely devine and it had a decent amount of crawfish chunks that made this dish an A in my book. My friends meals were not so much a hit. There was one order of the oyster pasta and two orders of the trio sampler (jambalaya, etouffee, and gumbo). The oyster pasta didn't taste like anything special and had fried oysters which i'm not a fan, but it wasn't bad by any means. As for the sampler, the jambalaya and gumbo were probably my least favorite of all the samples I tried throughout the weekend. None of us could pinpoint what the gumbo tasted like, but my friends didn't even finish their cup. The jambalaya was bland and did not stand out compared to all other options in the city. The Etouffee was quite tasty but only came in a small bowl alongside the other disappointing sample bowls. \n\nDespite the nice atmosphere, unique balcony dining, bomb oysters, and my cheesy ravioli, this place gets stars knocked off for the terrible service that we received at the table. First off, the waitress started off greeting our table by letting us know that they didn't do split checks, either cash or 1 card. Which was fine, except we clearly saw other tables get split checks, and honestly, its not that hard to do. When we went to order our food I wanted to ask her a quick question about the Yelp deal for 1 free appetizer since I saw it while checking in. As soon as I mentioned it she shook her head and stared at me like I was an idiot, stating that all deals were off for all restaurants around the area for the days leading up to Mardi Gras. False, we literally used a deal the night before coincidentally and the waitress there was great. And as if she couldn't leave it alone after I said it was alright, she again shook her head at me and told me how busy it was for Mardi Gras weekend. What. The. Hell. I get it. Move on. Our food also took a decent amount of time to come out, but we were also extra impatient because we were starving so the wait time might be an exaggeration. But it felt like forever. By the time it was time to pay for the bill our waitress reiterates again how they only accept 1 card on the check, after already giving us the non-split one check. Then comes back and gives us \"advice\" on how we pay the tip in cash if we didn't want to put it all on the card. Come on lady, the more that you talk, the less tip you're getting. It's like she thought this was our first time eating at a restaurant. Granted, we were a table of young women in our twenties, but plenty capable of paying for a meal. This has honestly got to be one of worst service experiences of my life. But I won't speak for the entire staff, the host that greeted us in front of the restaurant was extremely friendly. \n\nSide note, props to this place for having two stalls in their bathroom instead of one. Much appreciated.", "date": "2017-02-28 21:31:27"}

Loved my waiter, can't remember his name, but he had great suggestions for drinks and food. \n\nThe atmosphere is very laid back and you can come dressed comfy casual as you'd like. \n\nThe food: The oysters were so good I had to go back the next day for lunch. I ordered the Oysters Duo, which came with Rockefeller and another oyster type. But I also wanted to try their chargrilled oysters so they provide you two of each type of oyster if you ask. The rockefeller and chargrilled were my favorite. I wasn't going to order a drink because I was on business, but I'm in NOLA of course I did. My waiter recommended the Voodoo it was so tasty. It went down like juice. I was warned to be careful because it sneaks up on you, but I only had one. For my main course I ordered the seafood pasta. It was a bit peppery for me and the sauce was kind of watery, but still had flavor. For lunch the following day I ordered the same oysters duo with the three types of oysters and then I had the taste of New Orleans. They recommend against it because everyone down there serves those dishes. But I ordered it anyway along with my Voodoo. All three were good, but of the three I was impressed with the shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e. So next time I go back I know rockefeller oysters and chargrilled oysters with shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e.

I'm use to the cheese grits with the shrimp on top. The grits were fried into 2 coated triangle bricks with shrimp and shredded cheeses layed on top, in a pool of a slightly watery tomato based sauce.

This is such a beautiful and busy city yet charming and exclusive. There were so many restaurants to choose from but I was told that they were all good. I parked my car closest to Royal House so I decided to eat here. Big shout out to our waitress Raven! She was super welcoming, I enjoyed her conversations as much as I did the food.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very packed. We chose to sit at the one of the open window so we can enjoy the city walk while dining. We ordered grilled oysters, Rockefeller oysters and oysters royals, shrimp creole, crab claws in garlic butter and gumbo. \n\nThis was my first time having oysters in New Orleans. There is nothing better than eating a food at its origins. It's like eating a cheesesteak in the heart of Philly. The oysters royals had breading on top that makes it filling and hearty, the grilled oysters was fused with garlic butter and charred flavor, and the Rockefeller savory with creamy spinach. Individually, they were good, together? They were phenomenal! The shrimp creole was also distinctive, it tasted had a stronger acidic note than what I am used to but nevertheless, delicious. The real kicker here was the crab claws. It is not the claws themselves that makes this unique, it's the sauce! Oh man, the creamy, garlic butter sauce that the claws were cooked in is heavenly. You can put this in pasta, clams, on top of lobsters, oysters, roasted bread, pizza, rice, you name it, it will make everything a thousand times better! \n\nOverall, it was such an amazing experience. I'm used to Philly where it's busy and people rush you out of restaurants. Here however, we took our time and our waitress loved us for it, it's like she didn't want us to leave and just hang out. Big, busy city scene without the compromise of rushed service and terrific good. Royal House come highly recommended.", "date": "2017-03-15 17:17:40"}

I also made the terrible mistake of ordering the creole shrimp. The shrimp weren't deveined and I was told that is normal. Fine. Maybe I'm just a weirdo Texan who likes her shrimp cleaned. The bigger problem is that all of the  food was severely lacking in flavor to the point of being inedible. The etouffe and gumbo both tasted the same. The jambalaya could be choked down,  but only after I doused it in salt and pepper. To add insult to injury it took about 30 minutes to get our bloody mary's (which were ok) and about an hour to get our food (on a Monday with now crowds).

We only saw our server twice and had to hunt her down for our check. The entire upstairs floor was empty on the balcony and inside yet the service was very poor. Other than the Bloody Mary the food and service was poor.  Two stars simply for the Blood Mary's and the view from the balcony. Would not return here.", "date": "2017-04-08 22:26:30"}

Another group of 8-10 girls was seated nearby about 10 minutes after us. That group was promptly greeted and served bread while our server sat down some packaged saltine crackers (I guess because we ordered oysters). About an hour into us sitting down I asked if we were going to get bread to which I was told that they couldn't give us any because they didn't have enough to serve with entrees. Our food eventually came out, 5 out of the 8 dishes were completely cold and 1 of the 8 dishes was missing entirely. Also, the bread that they were \"saving\" for our entrees was as thick as a tortilla. They took the cold food back to be reheated after we complained. \n\nWhile waiting for food for a second time, our server asked if we wanted another round of drinks. One of the girls said \"I want something strong, I'll get an old fashioned\". She brought the old fashioned out in a TALL glass and told us they were out of short glasses. Shocking how many things this restaurant is \"out\" of. If you see the attached picture of the old fashion you will see how much of a joke this place is. When the bill came, my friend was charged for a double old fashioned. She asked the server why she was charged for a double when that is not what she ordered to which the server responded \"well you said you wanted something strong\". \n\nOverall a bad experience.

The oyster duo (Rockefeller/Royale) was a good way to start the meal. Of the two, we preferred the Royale. We ordered two orders of fried alligator, as each order only had about 4 pieces. I would say it tastes like fried chicken, but a bit chewy. The redfish beignets (fried golden brown in tempura batter and finished with a Crystal beurre blanc sauce and cane syrup) were probably my favorite- crispy and flavorful. The Taste of New Orleans is a sampling of the city's most famous dishes: Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. I didn't really care for any of them. \n\nThe evening was fine until we got our bill. My friend had ordered a drink and asked for another shot to be added as it was weak. She was surprised to see her drink was almost $20. We asked our bill to be split between card and cash. When the waiter came back with my card, he had taken all of my friend's cash. Did he think he was getting a 50% tip?! Uh, no. When I politely asked him for the change back from the cash, he told me I needed to sign my receipt first and the bartender will handle the change. Ok... Overall, IMO the place is overpriced tourist trap. Don't let the long lines fool you.", "date": "2017-04-29 18:00:30"}

When we were finally seated, we were greeted by our very awesome waiter.  Our service from start to finish was top notch as well.  \n\nWe checked in on Yelp, so were were able to redeem a free appetizer. I wanted to stick with some good ole Cajun food, so Fried Alligator it was!  It was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  It had a slight heat like I would expect out of this dish.  For my entree, I decided on the crawfish etouffee.  It was tasty and filling, but I have had better.  Now the table favorite which my daughter ordered was the pecan crusted mahi mahi.  It was pan seared, but with the pecan crust, it had a nice deep fried crust to it.  The lemon butter sauce topped on the fish was outstanding.  It really made the dish.  She ordered garlic mashed potatoes and hush puppies on the side which were both tasty.  My wife's redfish was delicious as well.  It was blackened just right and the taste was great.  For dessert, if there is bread pudding on the menu, I'm getting it, full or not!  What made this bread pudding stand apart from others is that there was peaches baked into it.  It was a nice touch and a pleasant change from just raisins.  The sauce on top was a frangelico sauce which is essentially a hazelnut topping.  Delicious I tell ya!\n\nOverall, I can see why this is a local favorite.  With thousands of reviews and high ratings, the ratings are well deserved!", "date": "2017-06-04 02:18:52"}

The fried alligator tasted exactly like chicken, we wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if we were aware that we were ordering gator.  The taste of New Orleans came with 3 small bowls of gumbo, chicken and sausage jambalaya, and crawfish etouffee. Of the 3, the best was the crawfish etouffee which was perfectly seasoned. The gumbo was not bad but I don't have much to compare it to. Their jambalaya was nothing special.

The oyster tacos were very yummy! The fried oyster and slaw was on a tortilla chip and the flavor was good. Only downside was that it was expensive for so little. The tacos was small and came with only 4 tacos. So 2 for me and 2 for mother. I wish there were more tacos for $14.\n\n2. The Jambalaya was great as well!

I'm not a big eater so I had the Oyster Tacos, which are really nicely grilled oysters served atop crispy tortilla chips with a generous helping of spicy, crunchy coleslaw. Delicious! I traded one to my husband for tastes of his Taste of New Orleans, a trio of shrimp and chicken gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish etouff\u00e9. The soup was flavorful with chunks of shrimp and chicken, not big pieces, just enough to flavor it. Jambalaya had andouille sausage, which I don't really like, but all the ingredients were balanced and blended so they all contributed to the soup without overpowering it. The crawfish was our favorite, yummy with a brown sauce and chunks of crawfish. Also, he had a side of red beans and rice; I've had it several times in NOLA and this was the best. (I do like my rice and beans so the beans are firm but tender and you can taste them, not mushed together like pea soup.)I tasted his dessert, bananas Foster with scoops of cheesecake on the side. He said it was the best dessert he ever had, and I agree it was exceptional.\nService was very relaxed but we were ok with it partly because of the storm; I liked that I didn't feel rushed although the place was doing a pretty brisk business.

I recommend checking in on the Yelp app so that you get a free appetizer (up to $12). We started with the crab claws, I believe they were $13.50 but we only had to pay $1.50 since the check in saved us $12. They were absolutely TO DIE FOR. The sauce is insanely flavorful! Tons of crab claws as well. Make sure to ask for extra bread.. you'll need it to dip into the sauce!\n\nWaitress recommended the crawfish ravioli with crab meat for our entree. Both the BF and I never really opt for crawfish but decided to try it out. It was delicious. Just the right amount of portion of heat mixed with tons of creole flavoring and crawfish. I would absolutely order this again and I would say this was probably one of our favorite meals of the trip.\n\nService was on point as well.

When I asked to sit on the balcony, they made it seem like an issue and verbally complained about having to walk me upstairs just so I could be seated. Needless to say, that rubbed me the wrong way, but I had my mind set on some fresh oysters (which are prevalent throughout New Orleans) and I had my eye focused on the potential vantage point from their balcony.\n\nThe waitress took nearly 15 minutes to approach my table to offer me a beverage. After ordering gumbo, she brought my gumbo out without a spoon. It took nearly another 15 minutes to get a spoon, which I obtained by going to the bar on my own accord. Upon acquiring my spoon, the gumbo was cold so I had it replaced.\n\nOn a positive note, the aforementioned food was spectacular. The oysters were fresh and nicely sized, the gumbo was delicious (when served warm), and my friend's catfish tasted as if it was seasoned by the hand of God.\n\nPros:\nOysters on the half shell,\nFried catfish,\nGumbo,\nThe location, and\nThe view from the balcony.\n\nCons:\nThe negative attitudes exhibited by some of Royal Houses' employees, \nThe poor service I experienced, and \nThe french fries were lackluster.\n\nAlthough I was disappointed, I would be open to giving Royal House another try if given the opportunity so I can taste God's catfish once more.", "date": "2017-08-18 23:56:48"}

Our sweet server came back numerous times to check on us, tell us history of the building and made us feel right at home.\n\nSTAR 3 = Food is delicious! Because I was all about loaded sandwiches, I opted for the fried shrimp po' boy, while the hubs opted for a roast beef po'boy - both of which were piled high with the \"fixin's\" (lettuce, tomato, pickles and more!) and tasted great! We started with the Alligator tail appetizer (cause why not!) and liked that as well! The food came out fast, was large in portion and totally hit the spot! Oysters is what this place is famous for, which I didn't end up sampling but def will next time!\n\nSTAR 4 = Make sure to check in on the Yelp app, as you get a free appetizer with the purchase of 2 entrees! \n\nAlthough a bit pricey (be prepared to drop a pretty penny), but totally worth it! :)\n4 stars for 4 vibessssss!", "date": "2017-10-18 21:15:04"}

My husband and I are visiting New Orleans for our tenth anniversary and for our first night really wanted a casual but good, Cajun/creole meal. Royal House absolutely did not disappoint. We arrived around 5:30 on a Saturday night and there was a line to get in. We were originally told it would be a twenty minute wait, but it was more like five minutes. We checked in on Yelp and received a free appetizer; hubby chose the fried alligator bites and I chose the crab claws. The alligator bites were good but not mind-blowing. The tarter sauce tasted homemade and was better than a typical tarter sauce. The star of the entire dinner were the crab claws. I cannot begin to describe how unbelievable the sauce was. The crab claws were small and more of a second thought to the bread and sauce! We ended up dipping everything we could in that sauce! I've never tasted anything like it in my life! It is filled with spice but is in no way spicy. For dinner hubby went with blackened shrimp & jambalaya and I chose the crawfish ravioli. The ravioli was definitely good, but I probably would have liked one of their other offerings better. Nothing was wrong with it-it tasted very fresh, and it's very possible that after my amazing appetizer nothing would ever taste good enough again! My hubby's dish was in my opinion much better than mine (so happy we almost always split all food 50/50 when in restaurants!). Shrimp were well cooked, fresh, and they definitely give you a large portion of them. They don't scrimp on the sausage either, and the chicken was white meat and shredded which we liked. The flavor was spot on, and we thoroughly enjoyed all the food we ordered. (Hubby really liked my ravioli). Portions were good for us-we were filled but not stuffed, with no leftovers. \nAs far as service goes, our waiter (I forget his name) was very friendly and helpful regarding the menu, and we got drinks immediately; our appetizers took a little longer than I would have liked, but being as packed as they were I can understand that. Our dinner came out literally as we took our last bite of our appetizer, and he was very quick when it came to bringing the check. I absolutely recommend this place-New Orleans has so many places we want to try but it will be very hard not to go back to the Royal House. Another interesting thing: we were seated upstairs and weddings would go by every 10-15 minutes, and everyone would leave their table to go out on the balcony to cheer on the couple. Definitely a great casual vibe. I only gave it 4 stars because it was our first dinner here; I may change it to five after we sample more of what NOLA has to offer!", "date": "2017-11-12 15:49:28"}

I've always know to avoid the french quarter if value and flavor is what you're in search of - shame on me, I suppose. We tried a sampler platter of \u00e9touff\u00e9e, gumbo, and Jambalaya. Not impressed with any dish they brought out. \n\nThe gumbo tasted more homogenous and sweet than muddy and interesting, and was much more refined than you normally would expect in a gumbo - as though they strained out all the wonderful bits that developed through time. I was told that a full cup of each soup comes with the platter of three items, but I would summate that if I had the ability to combine all three dishes, I would find little more than a cup of soup between all three. The rest of what I purchased assuredly was rice, so ask for rice on the side if you order a cup to be sure of your quantities - save for the jambalaya. \n\nThe jambalaya was mildly flavorful, and the sausage was fine - but not what you would expect in NOLA. Hell, I get better Andouille in Kansas City at a place called Fritz's Smoked Meats, on State-line Road. \n\nThe \u00e9touff\u00e9e was the most interesting, but still tasted like something other than seafood. I couldn't place it, but it's not what I expected - I could not eat it after a few tastings. They also seem to use some sort of thickener that has nothing to do with time and love; the soups were bordering on gelatinous. \n\nI would never return to this place, as the value gained from the purchase price is far too unbalanced; the death knell for me however must have been the flavors; they aren't revolting, but just not at all what you'd expect. More refined and subtle than the strong, dirty creole seasonings you search out for in NOLA. This experience serves me right, as in my travels I've come to take mark of establishments with \"sandwich wranglers\" hustling just outside the door, obnoxiously inviting patrons to dine within.

But my daughter is the one who really made out well; she ordered a $5 kid's fried shrimp platter, and got an enormous amount of tasty fried shrimp and fries.  She got probably twice the amount of food for $5 that I received for $18, and though it was unhealthy and lacked diversity, it was fresh and tasty.  \n\nOK, I get it, it's Thanksgiving and I ordered the most touristy thing on the menu, but geez.  This experience was just sad.  Never going back--unless I have a pack of hungry kids who like fried shrimp.", "date": "2017-11-26 16:15:44"}

Eating 10 pieces of bread dipped in this addicting sauce is definitely worth the calories & carbs!

It was such a small bowl AND there was a piece of bread underneath so the portion was SO SMALL. For this price, you can get double the portion at other places.\n\nSeafood Pasta (3/5): Tastes like canned tomato sauce and dining hall pasta.

The soup was absolutely wonderful. It was rich and not too salty, as the can often be. The cheese and bread baked on top broke up nicely as I ate it so I was left with a giant bread and cheese ball. The hush puppies were average. \n\nThe second visit was on a Tuesday afternoon. We couldn't sit on the balcony because those tables only seat two and this trip there were three of us. \nHowever we were able to sit next to the open doors of the balcony and still enjoy the lovely weather and view. \n\nWe had a couple cocktails that were both good.

She was expecting some sauce or more flavor as well to what she was eating. My other friend had the french onion soup and of course loved it.

My drink arrived first. It came in a tall glass with a black straw drowned into a blue liquid. The drink is made of rum and a variety of other ingredients. It was good but now, in retrospect, I don't think I would spend more than $6 for a drink so I would have opted for a beer or a cider if I could turn back time. My meal arrived and it consisted of a center of white rice surrounded by breaded crawfish in a crawfish stew with two small slices of bread. It was good and flavorful. I liked it. I was in New Orleans and half of my experience was about eating local food so I discovered from my girlfriend that she could get a free appetizer under $12 with her phone. By this I mean she checked in on Yelp to get the free appetizer but, honestly, she does magic with that phone a lot that it's not even funny sometimes (lol). Most of the stuff was priced above $12 but one thing was not and it was fried alligator. I decided to get that and try it (the menu says it costs $11.5). The fried alligator arrived shortly later and it consisted of breaded nuggets. Honestly, I found it surprisingly good and I really enjoyed it, probably more than the stew. It tasted like chicken nuggets but with some additional texture and a little harder. It was definitely the highlight of the night.\nThe place is nice. It has a bartender and several waiters going to tables. It feels like a nice place for dinner and people seem friendly. Yamini was nice and friendly with us.", "date": "2017-12-19 08:03:33"}

The food was delicious. \n\nWe had gumbo, raw bar, chargrilled oysters (drool), caprese salad, French onion soup (the BEST any of us had ever had), stuffed mushrooms and drinks. I really don't have the words to express how fresh and delicious the food was.  Everything was perfectly seasoned. The F.O. soup had a very light, yet extremely yummy creaminess to it. Not really noticeable to the eye, but you could see it's richness on the spoon and feel it on your tongue.\n\nBut wait...there's more! Not only did the food have our taste buds doing the happy dance, the service we received was top notch! Our server-Ty, a Nola native- was extremely pleasant and well informed about the menu, ingredients and preparations. He asked about our taste preferences and offered recommendations on food and drink. And his suggestions were spot-on.  With such a large party, i was overwhelmingly pleased at how quickly our various courses and orders arrived to the table. \n\nIn my opinion, Royal House is the kind of place that makes you want to return to a city just to further experience the menu.  In a city rich with excellent restaurants and even more menu options, i would (and will) recommend Royal House to anyone and everyone who asks!

The two that had yet to arrive were the Taste of New Orleans and the Seafood Pot. Ten minutes later we were informed by a different waiter that they did not have lobster so they were not able to make the Seafood Pot and later brought us the Alaskan Crab Pot, of which we did not ask for and thus had to return. At this time, we also inquired about the Taste of New Orleans since it had been nearly thirty minutes since ordering and the waiter stated that it was hectic in the kitchen and would now put in the order. Nearly fifteen minutes goes by before the waiter comes back and tells us that our food is on it's way. Twenty minutes and two inquiries later, our food comes and is lukewarm. At this point we just wanted to get our food, eat, and leave as soon as possible. When we got the bill it was a complete disaster. We were charged for three things that we didn't get and both the waiter and management unsuccessfully tried to argue their case as to why we needed to pay the full amount. Once paying the correct bill, we gladly left the restaurant as fast as we could. It is important to mention that our waiter, Billy, did the best that he could, but it just didn't pay off due to a plethora of factors. \n\nMy take away:\n\nA majority of tourists in New Orleans are seeking to have a good time and try some delicious Cajun food. Here, some of the dishes are good while others are mediocre at best. However, no matter the quality of the food, I feel that the environment and management of this establishment truly dampened a possibly wonderful experience. I will never come here again nor recommend it to anyone.", "date": "2017-12-25 23:45:31"}

What occurred was that we could not have our seafood pot because they had run out of lobster, so we asked if we could have a crab seafood pot instead. Rather than confirming with us, they said they had an idea of what we wanted and brought us a plate of Alaskan crab (which was not what we wanted). We had to send this one back and ask for an entirely different order since the one we wanted may have been a bit complicated. Additionally, we ordered 'The Taste of New Orleans' in our initial order, but never received it. Upon notification, our server placed the order in, having us wait another 20-25 minutes just for that order (my poor, hungry parents have been waiting for about an hour by then). We only received this order when we personally had to ask about its whereabouts. By then it was barely warm. Furthermore, we had ordered a SIDE of jambalaya, but they gave us an entire entree instead. We ate it unaware that it was, thus was charged for it.\nIn the end, when we received our check, we were charged for a seafood pot we never received ($50), an order that was way bigger than we even asked for, and an additional coke. \nI understand that other people may enjoy the food here, but, honestly, speaking from my own personal experience and opinion, don't bother.", "date": "2017-12-26 00:10:56"}

We arrived on a Saturday late afternoon with no wait at all. I really wanted the balcony view, so requested a table upstairs outside. Unfortunately, the balcony at Royal House is incredibly slanted and narrow. As nice as the view was overlooking the streets below, I was fearing for anything accidentally getting dropped over the balcony. You're literally sitting at a 30 degree angle --kind of scary.\n\nAnyways, we decided to order the Taste of New Orleans ($18) and Shrimp Creole ($18) to share. Since there was a free appetizer with a purchase of two entree deal on Yelp, we also added the Alligator Bites ($12). To start, the alligator bites were something new for us. It was a tiny little cup of fried bites that just tasted like fried meat --good, but nothing very special about it.\n\nNow since this was our first stop, we knew the taste of New Orleans would allow us to try a little bit of everything. This sampler came with a cup of Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffee, and Chicken & Andouille Gumbo. Along with the shrimp creole, everything was served over a bed of steamed white rice. The rice here was so hard, which made it not as enjoyable. While the jambalaya was our least favorite, the gumbo and shrimp creole were solid choices. The real dish to get here is the crawfish etouffee though. This is the first time I have ever had crawfish etouffee and Royal House has had me hooked! I honestly wish we just got a full order of it instead. The creamy gravy was so whole-hearted with every bite. I'd highly recommend the crawfish etouffee here and anywhere!", "date": "2018-01-24 16:53:24"}

If you are not fond of the typical sea water smell, I'd suggest getting a seat at a table as the bar can get quite stinky. Either way, seating was quick and painless and I was presented a menu right away. I of course wanted some darn oysters due to the fact that guy was shucking them in front of me and splashing me with that tasty salt water (Is that gross?). Ended up chatting with a local next to me and we shared a large platter of oysters raw and boy oh boy were they good! After downing some raw goodness, I realized that I had yet to sample any jambalaya or etouffee', which was sad as I had been in New Orleans for a few days already. The Royal House delivered though offering a sample platter with Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. Order took awhile to arrive, but not the end of the world. The sampler was good, but honestly not the best as some of the dishes were lukewarm and lacking some flavor. Pricing was on the high side, but hey it's the middle of the French Quarter, its like complaining while eating in the middle of Paris, expect it and move on. \n\nIn the end, would I come back, you betcha!

The host took us in addition to another party and sat us at the same time which felt very impersonal. After that, our server quickly took our drink order, then forgot one of our drinks. Finally about 15 minutes later our server returned to ask us for our order. Keep in mind, we were the first table sat upstairs, so why did we have to wait so long to put our order in? I asked about the market price of the seafood and then ordered the Alaskan snow crab but when our food came out they brought me a shrimp platter. When I told the food runner it was wrong he said \"oh this server never makes mistakes\" To which I said \"well I ordered the Alaskan crab...this is shrimp\" To which he then took it back and I didn't receive my order until Over half an hour later when the rest of my party had finished their food. When the wrong order had been brought out the server said he would ask the manager to do something for me. We never saw the manager until after our check came. When our server hadn't revisited our table almost thirty minutes after the crab came out, I asked for our check. The check included everything INCLUDING the shrimp platter that was never ordered AND the crab and I never saw a manager. So I asked to speak to the manager as I was originally told. The manager came out and I told him my complaint about the poor service with the crab and the time it took and how inconvenient it was that my party had already finished their food by the time I even got mine. He said \"I'm so sorry, let me see what I can do for you.\" He went to the back and then came back out and was doing his normal business throughout the restaurant and didn't come back to our table. Then our server came and grabbed our check and ran it, and then when he came back I asked to speak to the manager again. The manager came back and said \"what can I do for you?\" To which I was astounded and just said \"uhh...you said you were going to see what you could do about the service situation...\" he said \"sorry, let me see your check\" and then voided the check and recharged it without the crab or shrimp platter on there. Then he left the table and the server never came back to our table. We left and I doubt we will ever come back to this place. This was one of the worst experiences in dining I've ever had, and I feel like we were stereotyped as young men from the minute we walked in and treated on preconceptions of what we would pay/tip.

The jambalaya was delicious, the etoufee was great with just the right amount of spice but the gumbo was gross. It tasted like they had premade it and stuck it in the freezer and it had freezer burn on tasted like a refrigerator. I thought it was just me or the bread but I let one of my friends try and she spit it out. Maybe it was a bad batch who knows. Other than that it's a very open restaurant with the doors wide open.

I was not disappointed! \n\nPeople have recommended different restaurants to me for crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, but my fianc\u00e9 doesn't eat seafood (crazy, I know), so we chose Royal House because they serve burgers (lol). With that said, if you too are in the area and are with someone that doesn't like seafood, Royal House serves up a pretty decent burger, and they also have roast beef po boys as well as another chicken dish. It's clear that their specialty is seafood, though.\n\nAnyway, the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e was served with crawfish two ways-saut\u00e9ed in the gravy and fried crawfish tails. It was super flavorful, and the texture of the crawfish was great too. The portion size was also perfect-I usually never finished my food but I ate every last bite of my dish and felt comfortably full without feel overstuffed. This is only the second time I've had crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, but I'm so glad we chose Royal House because my dish truly exceeded my expectations.\n\nI've never tried oysters before, but they (obviously) have different oyster dishes as well that are good for splitting. Next time I come back will be with a seafood eating friend so I can try some of their other dishes.\n\nLastly, we came on a busy Saturday afternoon but were seated super quickly. Our server was also very knowledgeable and friendly, and I was surprised at how fast we received our food given how crowded it was. With that said, although it was crowded it never felt uncomfortable.

This guy should have a job cleaning streets or something that doesn't deal with the public.", "date": "2018-03-03 13:30:00"}

My mother sat there before and said it was very uncomfortable.\n\nOur waiter did not come for at least ten minutes, but once he did we went ahead and ordered our spinach dip appetizer. By the time we got it, it was cold and the chips were even stale. \nMy mom ordered the blackened fish with veggies and potatoes and I ordered the eggplant and chicken parmesan with added veggies. Her meal was delicious, and our waiter said it was his favorite and I agreed. The fried chicken on my pasta was crispy and fresh, but the eggplant completely slid out of the fried coating with one bite and the extra $4 veggies added were a few green beans which was unfortunate.\n\nI might come back when it is not during Mardi Gras, but for the reviews and the popularity, I expected a much better experience.", "date": "2018-03-03 15:58:28"}

Out of everything my friends and I ate during our stay in New Orleans, this was our least favorite place. I had the jambalaya which was good, and my friends had po' boys (one shrimp, one alligator) which they described as bland and flavorless. We also had a side of hush puppies which were just really salty (??).

It took about 25-30mins to get our food. But when it came out, my friend's plate had hair on it. So they had to take it back. \n\nIn the mix of all this, the manager and our waitress got into an intense argument. I literally thought they were going to fight. The entire upstairs was being ran by only two servers. So I guess the waitress were not happy with the amount of people being sent upstairs. \n\nThe food was good but overpriced.

The wait can be long though. My mom and I came to visit New Orleans back in December of 2017 for a weekend trip. I stumbled upon this place while trying to figure out a spot to eat dinner on a Saturday night. We got there around 7:30pm from what I remember and we put our name down on the wait list. The wait was about 45 minutes-1 hour but it wasn't too bad since there was like a marching band coming by so we had something to watch while waiting. It gets pretty crowded by Royal Street neighborhood with all the entertainment by the street performers. \nWe got seated next to the bar. We ordered dozen oysters (small), stuffed mushrooms, jambalaya, and some meat ball spaghetti. The dozen oysters were tiny but they tasted super fresh. The lemon and the sauce gives it a crisp taste. The stuffed mushrooms was also one of my favorite. The mushroom was baked and had some crab and shrimp stuffing in them which tasted so amazing! We also ordered the Taste of New Orleans which had three different dishes. It came in three small bowls and one had chicken & andouille jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and the other one was andouille gumbo. Out of the three my favorite was the crawfish. It had tons of flavor in that dish and I definitely enjoyed it. The spaghetti was plain though on the other hand. It tasted a bit bland to us. \nOverall, we had a good time at Royal House and I'd definitely would love to visit here again!", "date": "2018-03-20 16:49:14"}

I would literally come back to New Orleans just for that dish. I ate every last drop too. I also ordered the charbroiled oysters and Oysters Rockefeller. They were very good, with the charbroiled being the better of the two, which my server recommended before I ordered. On top of the fantastic food, the service was the best! I came in right at 11 am and was immediately and happily whisked off to the balcony tables, which are incredibly charming. My server was the sweetest and everything came out hot, delicious, fast, and with a smile. The service here was better than any other restaurant we went to while in town.

I had heard a lot of good things about the crab claws and Royal House is super close to where we were staying so it was the perfect option. \n\nWe were seated upstairs - it was a pretty busy evening though I don't think there were any lines. The bf ordered a gumbo for a soup and I also ordered two appetisers - the crab claws and the chargrilled oysters. The crab claws were amazing!! I really enjoyed this dish. I'm not sure what they put in that sauce, but I was addicted! As for the gumbo and the chargrilled oysters - these were average and nothing to write home about. In addition, it took a while for us to track down a spoon to use to eat the gumbo as we didn't get one. In the end, I ended up asking the bar tender at the upstairs bar for a spare spoon as our server was no where to be found. \n\nAs for mains, I ordered their Taste of New Orleans - I had plenty of gumbo during my stay but no jambalaya or \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Again, I would say this was average. I had eaten better gumbo and nothing about the jambalaya or the \u00e9touff\u00e9e was outstanding. The bf ordered the red beans dish - he said it was alright.\n\nOverall, we left our dinner at Royal House both agreeing that we had eaten at better places during our stay in NOLA. Someone once said that NOLA restaurants are generally known for one thing that they do exceptionally, and everything else on the menu is just average. I would agree with that in Royal House's case.

Our entrees took an hour to arrive. \n4. When they did come out, they were disgusting. One of them was burnt past recognition and missing multiple ingredients--26 dollars for a literal charred piece of unrecognizable fish and some soggy vegetables is a travesty. My shrimp caprese was truly one of the most confusing dishes I've ever had--the presentation looked like a drunk child had tried to make their parents dinner, and it tasted somehow flavorless and oversalted at the same time. On top of that, there were still bits of shell on the shrimp and I accidentally swallowed it. The shrimp smelled bad and tasted old, and afterwards I threw it all up in their bathroom. My body rejected it so swiftly it was kind of impressive. The other dishes were sloppy and oversalted. It all looked like slop.\n5. When we decided to ask to speak to the manager (and multiple ppl in our party are servers, so we didn't take this lightly), he took forever to come over. When he did, you could tell he didn't care at all about our legitimate concerns.

The place seemed well staffed, something I always appreciate. \n\nI was deeply disappointed when right on top were two empty mussel shells. Not only that, there was a closed off clam shell as well. I can look past this to a point, but was surely disappointed. Not only that, but there were shell bits throughout the bowl. Ouch!! I won't discredit the taste of the pasta though. The sauce had a nice heat and I really enjoyed it. \n\nMy colleagues ordered gumbo that didn't come with a spoon. Uncertain if that was intentional or not. They both ordered the alligator bites and thought they were just okay, required the cocktail sauce it came with. \n\nThe waiter started to lose our love for him as the lunch went on. He kind of disappeared. He offered me a refill and never brought it. My colleague requested more sauce and he never brought it.

First time we had an amazing experience. This time, not so much. We showed up at around 9:15, after a wonderful hour of music at the Preservation Hall. My 9 year old was starving. We sat down and for a good 10 min, no one came to take our order. Eventually, a waiter- whose name is Jheran- came and took the order of someone who just got in. He was on his way back, with no intention of stopping at our table, when we stopped him and ask him politely to take our order because we are waiting for a long time and our daughter was starving. Well, I guess he didn't like us complaining, because 30 min after our food was not yet on the table. People around us ordered and finished. Our food arrived at 10:10, so 50 min after, brought by other waiter. My oysters were burned and dry, and instead of the nice toast that comes with it, there was this old piece of bread, lonely and cold. My mojito arrived after I got up and asked the bartender to make me one, probably 40 min after we ordered. He never came for water refills, my husband had to get up and ask the bartender for water. Needless to say, we complained to the manager who was super nice, listened, apologized sincerely for what happened and took care of the bill. What a sad way to finish our 6 days in NOLA.

That is a pretty tough rating to give, but this place worked for it. I think I can safely say I had one of the strangest dining experiences here. \n\nAfter doing my homework before the trip, this place was bookmarked because they offered a \"Taste of New Orleans\" dish and the reviews here seemed excellent. So, off we went. And, just for good measure, I am going to copy/paste right from their site as it currently reads: Taste of New Orleans $18.00\nA sampling of the city's most famous dishes: Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo.\n\nWeird that I did that, right? Well, yeah, it is weird and so is this story. \nSat down. Pulled up Yelp for the discount (free appetizer) and was informed that I had to buy 2 entrees if I wanted to use it. Done, no problem, we had already planned to anyway. We opted for the alligator bites and ordered some drinks while my husband worked on deciding what he wanted. Finally came time to order and I ordered the Taste of New Orleans and the waitress informed me they were out of it. So, I asked which part they were out of (thinking I could still get it and just be short one of them, which would have been cool with me) and she said, well we actually aren't out of it but we don't have the right dishes. Oh? Ok. So, I said I needed another minute to think it over. After thinking about it I asked if maybe they could just put it in the to-go containers and I would eat it that way? She said no because the manager didn't like how it looked on the table, which I totally get. SO, THEN I said, hmmm well, I think I will just get it to go and we will find a little park to eat in outside and she said no she couldn't do that because they were all out of it. After looping through the whole, \"which part?\", \"well, we have everything but we can't serve it\" routine, she basically was just like, look, this menu item is not available for purchase. LOL HUH? \n\nReally guys, this happened. AND THEN the alligator bites come out (which were OUTSTANDING by the way!) low and behold the dish they were served in, a little crock. Honestly, the exact thing this trio would have been served on. At this point, I knew a few things. I knew I wouldn't be giving this place any more of my business, I knew my Yelp coupon would be voided and I knew that I was beyond annoyed. SO, I did something I rarely do, asked to.....speak to the manager...it actually hurts to type it. Anyways, manager guy comes over and rude as can be and says YOU CANT ORDER IT, WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPER DISHES THEY ARE ON BACK ORDER and walks away. (LOL???????) HUH?\n\nSo. This happened. Just to clarify- the place had bowls, the place had smaller crocks, the place had plates and anything from that trio could have been ordered on it's own. I was and still am perplexed at this whole scenario. Honestly. It is not my nature to cause a stink, but I couldn't let this go for some reason, mostly because it made ZERO sense. FIND A WAY. That's it. Like seriously. Especially if the nagging customer (me) asked about it for like 15 minutes in 15 different ways! YEESH! \n\nThere are too many excellent choices for grubbing in NOLA, skip this one!", "date": "2018-04-19 19:05:48"}

I could see one item coming out cold but all of them (especially the oysters?)\n\nThe manager apologized and took items off the bill but it wasn't the money principal - our celebration for our friend was not the way you want to remember a birthday meal.

The po boys were perfectly fine, but the oysters and crab claws were absolutely divine. The sauce with the crab claws was a tangy deliciousness that had a 'homestyle cooking' feel. The oysters were not rubbery and grilled to perfection. I highly recommend eating here to anyone who wants to experience good N'awlins-style cookin.", "date": "2018-05-09 18:05:26"}

Go with the royale and chargrilled.  Very good and not something you find elsewhere.

You could go next level by using sauce from crab claw app above as condiment!\n\nFor your sides don't get the fries. French fries are the same everywhere. Get the Jumbalaya or gumbo subbed in.

I want to include all the details, so I apologize for the length of this review. It started off right. Our server, Danny, was personable and had great recommendations for the table. We had entered the place ready to enjoy ourselves, and he was delivering a great experience. Everyone in my party was there for the seafood, and I had called ahead to ensure they would be able to make one of their dishes vegetarian. I am always a little wary of places being understanding about dietary restrictions. My restriction is not a casual preference, but a deep religious belief, and respect of additional questions I have is very important. The host who answered when I called volunteered that one of the dishes I was looking at was fried in the same oil as meat, so Royal House seemed to be one of the establishments that respected restrictions. My experience when I received my food, however, was very different.\n\nThe appetizers we had were all decent. When the entrees came out, the food runner put mine down and mentioned oysters. I asked if there were oysters in the dish, since I had ordered without. He said he didn't know, he just ran the food, and that was the name of the dish. Fair enough. I asked if our server or someone else would be available to confirm. He then got defensive and said he was just someone who brought the food, and how was he supposed to know what was in my dish? If the server had put a note in, I would be fine. I know from experience that notes are often missed in busy kitchens. It is much better for me to confirm then have a surprise reaction to my dish. After a few minutes back and forth asking to speak with someone who would know, he told me that the dish actually didn't have oysters. The oysters would be on top. At this point, I needed to be certain there hadn't been a mixup. This is where things really went downhill with disrespectful service.\n\nDanny had been busy and I couldn't find him, so I asked the hostess if she could confirm with the kitchen. The manager on duty that night came to address me, and immediately approached the conversation as if I were being unreasonable. She told me that she apologized that the food runner called my dish by its name, which included oysters, but the oysters would be on top of my dish so there were no oysters in the dish. I said I understood, but I really wanted her to check with the kitchen and confirm the dish, as made, was 100% vegetarian. Kitchens add animal fats, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce, and other ingredients all the time. She told me she didn't need to check with the kitchen because she had worked in the kitchen, and the oysters would have been on top. This was reiterated to my four times. Each time, the manager refused to check with the kitchen. I believe the manager's name was Taia, but she was reluctant to give me her name. She told me she loved her guests, and she didn't know why I was treating her badly. I didn't feel I was treating her badly, but I really couldn't understand why she just couldn't confirm with the kitchen to make me comfortable. I started to get upset. She wouldn't look at me or address me with respect. She kept looking at one of the members of my party, who was also black, as if asking him to reason with me. I suddenly felt like I was being treated differently because of my Indian descent. When Danny returned to the table, he found me tearful. \n\nI didn't eat my meal. The manager later came over to give us the check and aggressively showed the members of the party the note about not having oysters in the dish. She did take that off of the bill, along with an order of oysters that had not arrived before our entrees. There was no other apology, because she felt she was fully correct in not double checking that my meal was safe for me to eat. \n\nAt the end of the meal, she came back to our table, and asked if there was anything else she could do. I told her I would have been fine had she just checked with the kitchen, and tried to explain how serious my vegetarianism was. At this point she interrupted me and again told me I had been treating her very badly on Mother's Day. She actually suddenly decided to tell me she had checked with the kitchen, and told me she had checked with the kitchen four times. I had misunderstood her. This is another moment where I felt I was being treated differently by Taia due to my race. Perhaps she assumed English wasn't my first language. I had been stubborn about needing this confirmation earlier to feel safe, and she had explicitly told me that she would not do it. I know I did not misunderstand her. She then accused me of not saying thank you like other members in our party. I certainly had nothing I felt thankful about when it came to her service. Our waiter Danny had received plenty of thanks. I was extremely upset about the way I was treated here. The food was fine, but this sort of disrespect was unacceptable.", "date": "2018-05-14 12:21:58"}

All servers were friendly and knowledgeable about the subtle differences in menu items. Smiles abound and great conversation about New Orleans and local hangs to find.\n\nTaste:\nOysters came out in full flavor. The Rockefeller oysters were very filling and satisfying. If you are hungry from a day of strolling around and looking for some tasty apps and entrees, the Royal House will deliver.\n\nDietary Accommodations:\nSeafood, seafood, seafood! Sound good? The Royal House may not specifically  offer gluten free or vegan options but once again, not sure why a vegan would go to a seafood place? Rest assure though, they have a selection of salads to satisfy the pallet and a lot of naturally gluten free options. A little something for everyone.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe Royal House offers its patrons a charming throwback to the 1700s with an upscale feel. \n\nBalcony: sounds of the hustle bustle from below: some music, traffic, and people. Great views. Great place to unwind after a heavy day of tourism and to prepare you for the nighttime festivities.\n\nOverall Experience:\nFor starters, I received a free app for checking in with yelp. Not sure if this is always offered but it's worth \"a check-in.\"\nMy friend and I had a great experience. The balcony views were great, the servers were all super friendly and the food was refreshingly good. Give them a try if you're in town.", "date": "2018-06-05 22:58:12"}

No napkins on the table for the drinks and when we asked the waitress for a napkin it look like she pulled out napkins from her apron that of been in there for two weeks and just toss them on the table.

It's not like I could've said anything sooner since she didn't come around. \n\nAnywho I was able to get it to go (with no Togo utensils), and the oysters had so much shell in them.

We ordered the oysters royale and crab claws, both of which were very tasty. However, there were numerous other issues.

Our waiter was Joe and he was not the most attentive waiter. We did not have great service and despite the restaurant not being too busy the food still came out quite slow. He took an awfully long time to bring us a glass of wine even after ordering it after we sat down. \n\nFirst, we ordered the oyster tacos appetizer, and for one thing, chips are not a taco. You should not be calling them tacos when you place oysters on 5 tortilla chips. Secondly, the oyster tacos have a super SPICY sauce on top which they don't even mention on the menu!! I love spicy things but they slathered the sauce on each chip that you could barely taste the oyster and your lips go numb as soon as you swallow. When I asked our waiter Joe about the sauce he said it was a chipotle pepper sauce and I mentioned it was terribly spicy and he walked away as if he didn't care about satisfied customers. Either put it on the menu, put a small drop on each oyster, or have the waiter inform you when ordering it! \n\nThe pecan mahi mahi was good but you couldn't really taste that it was pecan. Etouffee was good. Blackened shrimp and jambalaya left little to be desired. \n\nDuring our meal, one of the busboys ran into my sister's arm hard but didn't notice nor apologize.

I do not eat shrimp so the server told me I could substitute with extra of another meat instead. I ended up getting extra scallops. When my dish came out the smell was just heavenly and adding the extra scallops was probably the best decision I made! The scallops were huge and they were seared off perfectly! Here's the kicker though... The dish did not come in a marinara sauce it was in what looked like a white sauce with what I can only assume was grated Parmesan on top. \n\nMy fiance got the oysters as appetizers which were alright nothing special really.

I officially have a tradition of having one super trash ass meal every time I go to New Orleans. Last time Mother's took that title...this time it's Royal House which is sad considering it was one of my best meals the last time I was here. So either they have declined immensely or I ate a bunch of trash last time. \n\nThere was some confusion with seating at the beginning. Once we got seated, although we were acknowledged a few times, it still took a while for the waitress to come take any orders. By the time she got to us we were ready to order. For appetizer, fried alligator (which was lit) and crab claws (I expected big ass claws and not the blue crab joints but the sauce alone redeemed the plate) which took a while to come to the table. Even tho we waited an eternity, I thought the tasty appetizers would lead the way to a tasty meal but... I was sadly mistaken.\n\nAfter waiting for the Third Coming of Jesus, our meals finally arrived. Lemme start with the blackened redfish that should be advertised as Dehydrated Redfish. MakeYouChokeFish. Seasoned ok but overcooked. The veggies were undercooked and hard. The real disappointment tho is the damn Taste of New Orleans. Three small bowls of sadness and depression. No flavor at all. They must have burnt the roux in the gumbo...that was the only flavor I could get from that. Etoufee tasted like nothing, jambalaya was trash. If that was the flavors of NO then everybody needs tongueotomies...and yes I made up a word. I had them comp my meal and refused to order anything else because I would be able to cash my retirement by the time the meal would have arrived. \n\nWhat lured me in was the damn free appetizer with a Yelp check in (tryna be cheap after blowing my per diem at emeril's) and we couldn't eem use it after they comped my meal. I was in that joint mad emotional ...brink of tears. Then once we were finally able to leave this two hour ordeal, I was greeted by the Queen of cockroaches outside of their bathroom. \n\nRoyal House = Royal Trash.", "date": "2018-06-28 13:34:56"}

I'm speaking of Royal Street...okay, so not your typical type of royal-ness, but even so, if you want a royally good meal, check out Royal House. I've had two food experiences here (about three years apart) and both were great, though we'll get into why things boiled down to four stars shortly.\n\nFor starters (if you didn't already guess), you'll find Royal House on Royal Street at the corner of the namesake road and St. Louis Street. It's perfect in proximity to Omni Royal Orleans where I stayed on both trips to The Big Easy. Walking up you'll notice a somewhat classy European style similar to many establishments in the French Quarter. A nice-sized bar on the first floor with a smaller eating area in the back. At the time of this most recent meal, things were a little crowded so we actually headed upstairs where you'll find a whole other level of seating (and a another bar!). \n\nOnce quickly situated, we were under way. I had talked up char-grilled oysters to my family for years and so we began with a dozen of these babies. Their garlicky, buttery flavor hit the spot and should be tasted even if you're not a fan of this bivalve. With the help of a Yelp check in offer, we also snagged a small appetizer of fried alligator (don't freak out, it's actually delicious). The breading was different from what I remembered, but it still did the trick of being tasty.\n\nHere's where my memory comes into question. I've spent the last three years dreaming of Royal House's shrimp and grits. When I came in 2015, the dish was amazing and easily went down as my favorite meal of the trip. This time? It was different than what I remembered. Less spicy with the shrimp being more barbecued than that last plate. The grits were a bit off as well. Don't get me wrong, it was still totally tasty, but not what I was hoping for. In fact, I might say some shrimp and grits dishes from New York were better (oh my!). But even so, the meal was great (even with a good, but forgettable, waiter).\n\nOverall, Royal House delivered on a quality NOLA-style meal. With a beautiful interior and a tasty selection of choices, I definitely recommend it to those visiting New Orleans. For myself, I now have new images in my head plastered over the old ones. Those originals were five stars. These are more four. Hey, it's like the changing of the crown. Sometimes you absolutely love royalty and sometimes you can't stand it. We'll call this one somewhere decently above an average kingdom on a street made for royalty.", "date": "2018-07-05 15:38:27"}

I don't know what they do, but it was just enough Parmesan, garlic and all the goods on top of a perfectly grilled oyster.

Meanwhile, if you aren't a tourist and have had true Cajun food, what comes out of the kitchen might disappoint you, as it did us. Keep in mind I can only comment on what we ate, which wasn't good. It was below average, unfortunately. Considering the inflated cost we almost sent it back, but after waiting more than 40 minutes for our food, we figured it was in our best interest to scarf it down (regrettably) and continue on to Pat Obrien's. \n\nI've eaten Cajun food religiously across the South for almost two decades now and through experience have learned good and not-so-good. For example, I ordered blackened redfish at Pappadeaux in Dallas on Wednesday night, then blackened redfish here at the Royal House Thursday and then the same dish at Louisiana Lagniappe Restaurant in Baton Rouge on Friday night. The first and third were juicy, well seasoned and flavorful. At Royal House the redfish was severely overcooked, mildly fishy (unacceptable), the thickest part of the fillet was dry and the entire third of the outside portion was tough as leather. \n\nAs for the ribeye, we ordered it rare. All but the inside third of the meat had no pink to it. None. Again, more than overcooked. Maybe leather like fish and meat is the in-thing here? As for the vegetables, we had just left Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop in Metarie for lunch where our side of veggies were seasoned, fresh and crisp, which embarrassed Royal's canned tasting, soft veggies. The entire meal was a waste of money, time and took away from one of our two true NOLA Cajun meals. We were only here one night. \n\nUnfortunately, we didn't choose to eat here, but their sister restaurant (which did look good in photos) closed two hours early because they wanted to paint. They sent us to Royal and said the food was exactly the same. In addition, service was poor. More than 40 minutes to get our food and a waitress with an attitude. We won't be back.

We got seated at 10:45am, we're given breakfast menus and waited for 15 minutes for our server.  At 11, our server came and told us we couldn't order breakfast because it was 11. WTH?  We rolled with it and decided to get drinks.  35 minutes later-still no drinks.  Couldn't find our sever, so we approached a guy we thought was the manager and he said he would take care of it.  Still no drinks, although all other tables had drinks.  Finally got our drinks but we're missing 2.  Staff did nothing so I walked up to the bar and asked the bartender who personally delivered the drinks to our table.  We ordered our food at 11 and didn't get our food till almost noon.  We were missing a couple of meals which they brought out easy enough because we had finally found a manager.  My mom sat at the table and ate her soup with a fork because no one would get a spoon until we finally walked up to the bar and approached the guy who was just talking.  Not one staff member had told the manager we were having issues even though we all got up multiple times and asked about drinks and our food.  Our server rarely came because he didn't want to deal with the questions.  Finally after over 2 hrs of sitting there and eating,  we heard the server asking the manager to get us out if there and that we were problems.  To even be able to over hear that is so unprofessional as we just wanted a quick breakfast and be done!  Were we supposed to sit there for 30 minutes without our bar drinks and just stay quiet?  We had the best service with the clean up of our dishes!  The food was ok-the baked oysters were really salty but their blood Mary's are really good if you get one.  The two people who recommended this place have one multiple times but just as a couple and they've had great experiences but they felt so bad recommending especially for a birthday breakfast.  The manager did take off several meals and was apologetic which was helpful.  When we were walking out from the second floor to the first floor,  there were people all complaining about service and wait time.  They could have had call ins that day for servers-I don't know but it was a theme of poor service all over.", "date": "2018-11-15 11:15:51"}

Sure, you pay for the ambiance or the overall hype but Royal House was a disappointment for such a pricey lunch.\n\nThe food was nothing spectacular and as someone who rarely uses the salt shaker, it was pretty much next to my plate the entire time.  I ordered the pasta with seafood, and the husband ordered the seafood combo.  We also ordered a dozen of oysters and their crab claws off the appetizer list.  The oysters had an unusual smell and taste.  My husband and I love oysters and we usually toss a coin to see who gets the last one -- this time, we actually insisted to pass.  My pasta was tasteless and appeared to be a whole blob of spaghetti noodles thrown in with under seasoned seafood bites.  My mussels were empty shells and the rest of it needed salt or any form of seasoning.  The husband was not particularly impressed with his dish neither.\n\nHere is the big kicker:  our entrees took a full hour to get to our table.  I was so upset, I nearly walked out but as I was getting ready to leave -- the food miraculously came out of the kitchen.  I could've left but choose not to because I knew that if I did at that point, the restaurant would have tossed out the food.  I hate food waste, so we stayed and grunted as we stuffed down the food we no longer wanted.\n\nI'm giving an extra star to the rating because our crab claws were really good.  The sauce was of what we thought a good creole dish should taste like.  I'm giving one more extra star for the outside patio seating.  On a nice day, you get to sit above the restaurant and watch all the festivities that take place on Royal Street.

None of it was well done. None.\nI ordered the shrimp creole.  The flavor was not good. Desperately needed seasoning and a kick. Asked for the hotsauce, but quickly realized that my dish was almost completely cold.  Even the bowl they had it in was cool to the touch.  I never send stuff back unless it's truly terrible- but barely warm fish is not very good. They offered to microwave it for me to warm it up- bc microwaved shrimp is good. Um no. So they took it back to remake- but 30 minutes later, my husband is done with his, and mine is still not out. So I told him just to take it off our check.\nNeighbors with the 1hr experience had shared their meal to do the bread pudding- and regretted it.

Be honest with you, the best dishes among three is the side salad. Start from the shrimp jambalaya. Seriously, o travelled from Chicago to NOLA, and found the jambalaya is much worse than my local restaurant. How ironic that could be. The jambalaya was just so dry, so salty. And the shrimp inside tasted like frozen shrimp. I can even smell the chemicals on the shrimp to keep it fresh. The rice is not juicy, but only salty and dry. If I was not extrem hungry, I don't even want to keep it. Really because I cannot wait for another half hour to get my dish, I just choose to bear it. And the oyster pasta, so watery, so much soup inside. And we could tell that the food might have been ready for a while, but the waitress forgot to bring to us, so the noodle already got sticky together. After all that, the worst part is the price. For those okay food, if you charge me less than $15, I could tell myself to bear them.

My girlfriend ordered the house burger and I've never seen a burger be butchered so badly. She ordered it medium well with bacon (additional $2).

I wish I would have taken a picture of the dish in all its dry, rubbery glory because someone else needs to witness it. The corn that came with it was inedible (think biting into the brown corn stalks you see people decorating with at Thanksgiving) and the potatoes were so salty, like a cured ham. \n\nWhen the server asked how the food was I told her it was overcooked and not good. She didn't say anything and then seemed to be avoiding eye contact the rest of the time we were there. She cleared everyone's plates except for my very full one even though I placed my silverware and napkin on the table, clearly done. I could have (and honestly should have) made a bigger stink to save myself the wasted money but I was so done and didn't feel like expending the energy. Finally, after she gave us the checks back, I was able to ask her to please take the plate and reiterated how dry and overcooked and cold it was. She said, \"I got you.\" and took the plate away. No apology or anything. I mean I know it's uncomfortable when someone tells you the food is bad but come on!\n\nSo disappointing. A very sour ending to our New Orleans trip.

I am only going to say this once, this is pound for pound the best Oyster bar in the city, which means it is one of the best Oyster bars in the country! \n\nFor me my bread and butter is the Crab claws...dude...no lie, I honestly feel like they sprinkle crack in it or something, it is the very definition of delicious and HANDS down the best version of crab claws in the city of New Orleans and I stand by that statement! Oh and here is a pro move, order it with extra crab meat...thank me later!\n\nNext is the Redfish Beignet, this is one of the most simple yet unique dishes I have ever tasted and for me it's the signature dish of the resteraunt, it is sweet savory with just a wisp of spice, but what makes it delicious is that it is really light with the texture of a tempura, honestly it is a perfect marriage of all the beautiful flavors of New Orleans, whoever created this dish needs a t-shirt with their picture on it AND a second line in their honor no cap!\n\nLastly I am gonna show love to the oyster shuckers, if you come to this place I highly encourage you to sit at the Oyster Bar and if you are REALLY lucky Nirobi or Anthony will be working and without question they are the heart and SOUL of the Royal house and are perfect ambassadors of everything southern and New Orleans, they are fun informative and talented, watching them work is special because they make something that is truly difficult look easy while fully engaging you in colorful and fun dialogue.", "date": "2019-02-05 06:32:36"}

We sat at the bar to order the food and the waiter/bartender was chucking oysters at the bar contaminating all the glassware at the bar with raw oyster juice. To make things worse, after chucking said oysters, he then proceeds to grab a glass with his unwashed hands and pours water with the same unwashed hands!!! We then witness this same guy grabbing a to-go cup on the inside of the cup and used one of those hand-held soda streamer with unwashed hands. There was visible oyster debris on his hands and arms while he was making drinks. We promptly walked away from the bar and requested to sit at a table with a different waiter. It just so happened that we were sat near a window facing the outside street where the restaurant keeps their garbage cans. The same bartender/oyster chucker was seen outside throwing away oyster shells and trash in the garbage bins while still \"bartending.\" we were absolutely disgusted of this place's lack of food hygiene and SEVERE contamination. This is a serious health concern especially for those with deadly shellfish allergy, avoid at all cost!!!!!  If this guy is so blatantly unhygienic in front of patrons, I cannot fathom what happens in the kitchen.\n\nAs many have said, the reviews and high ratings are very skeptical to say the least.

We ended up at Royal House based on proximity and didn't really know what to expect,  but I was perfectly content with it. After ordering a hot tea and deciding on the spinach dip as an appetizer for the table (free appetizer with a Yelp check-in!), I perused the menu and had trouble deciding as there were a couple things I really wanted to try. I finally opted for the Roast Beef Po-Boy: Tender debris roasted beef smothered in a brown gravy with a side of French fries.\n \nThere was entirely too much to eat, even considering the fact that it was 5:00pm and it was my first meal of the day, but it was pretty tasty. The roast beef was cooked well, with no fatty pieces and the gravy had a rich home-style flavor. I do wish that all of the sandwich ingredients had been listed on the menu because I bit into a pickle and that about made me start gagging. I absolutely detest pickles and it is not an item I'd expect on a hot roast beef sandwich. Luckily, there were so many other ingredients and only a few pickle slices, so I was able to pick them off before their nasty juices saturated my bread. The fries were fine but could have done with more seasoning. I used the excess gravy from the Po-Boy to dip them in, but on their own, they were a bit bland.\n \nPrices were a little steep in my opinion, but likely on par with the rest of the French Quarter. The restaurant itself was very unique with intricate wood detailing throughout. Although it was a bit small, at least on the side we were sitting, the tables were positioned so that we didn't feel crammed. Also, our waiter was extremely friendly and smiley, which along with the food, brought us out of our hangry attitudes!", "date": "2019-03-01 00:09:16"}

The tortellini was melt in your mouth and the sauce was yummy!  I would def come back for another great meal or to grab some oysters and cocktails at their bar.", "date": "2019-03-12 16:26:46"}

Experiment overall was less than I expected. \n\nSo I usually look a place, if it's less that 4 stars I'm probably not going there for dinner. If it's 4 stars I'll give it shot. And if my experience was less than what I would expect I rate it lower and if it's better I rate it higher.\n\nSo my wife and I got to this place pretty late probably 9:30. The hostess quoted us for 15 mins so we waited. After about 10 she asked if we would mind sitting at the bar. My wife doesn't really drink so the bar isn't usually our go to for dining but since it was getting late, we went for it. Usually at a bar service is quicker since the bartender is right there and isn't hopping around to tables. The bartender immediately asks for our IDs but wasn't very courteous about it, he said it almost like he didn't think we were of drinking age and he expected that he would turn us away. We both are of age but we look younger so I wasn't surprised he asked just was expecting a little southern charm in the Big Easy and never really got that. On that same note, a guy and his son later sat down at the bar, the rest of their family, 4 women sat behind them, in assuming because they couldn't seat them all together. And the guy gave them the same speil about \"having a valid ID\" which the kid who was probably 13 clearly didn't... then the bartender went on to explain that you have to be over 21 to sit at the bar. I'm not from LA but I'm pretty sure that, that is not the law and I know most states have exceptions for consuming alcohol if you are with a parent/guardian anyway. Doesn't really matter I guess the restaurant can do whatever they want but the bartender later complained to other patrons about how people should have their IDs. \n\nThe bartender was also shucking oysters when the entire time we were there. Typically that's something done in the kitchen or at least at a back work station. Sounds petty, I don't have an aversion to it and it didn't ruin my meal but if your going to charge 20 dollars for shrimp and grits that I could have made in my microwave and 12 for a cocktail, don't shuck your oysters at the bar and then barely wash your hands before you handle everything that you touch. Also my wife ordered a coke when I ordered my cocktail, again we are at the bar, I could have reached over and sprayed the damn thing into a glass myself if there was a glass close enough, but I had to ask the guy a second time to get her what she already ordered, this is after they had to outsource my drink. I pretty sure the guy said at one point, \"we are waiting on the whiskey\", which I was confused about what that meant. Either way he definitely didn't make it, I think the other bartender did, and that way about 10 mins after I ordered it. \n\nSpinach dip was good but that's pretty simple honestly and hard to mess up. The shrimp and grits weren't bad as far as taste. I live along the gulf coast and I've had my share of shrimp and grits, so I was expecting large sized fresh shrimp but instead it seemed like frozen ones out of a bag tossed in sauce over 3 scoops of grits. And yes I could tell that they were scooped out of a larger dish; they were like 3 little mounds of grits. I don't think they were cheese grits either. Also the bowl that it came in was hotter than the actual meal, so they obviously warmed it up. Again it was edible but certainly not worth 20 dollars. \n\nI think a lot of places in New Orleans rely on tourism and overprice their items accordingly. This is definitely one of those places.", "date": "2019-03-21 04:29:04"}

I visited this restaurant on my last night in New Orleans and I wish I would've picked something else. The noise level was pretty loud, but given the restaurant size it was understandable. Our waitress was the downfall of the evening. She came over to start us off with drinks and when I requested the Espresso Martini she adamantly warned me not to get it, that no one orders it, and if someone does it usually gets sent back. She made a different cocktail recommendation that was all fruit juice and melon liquer which turned out to be a total miss. Beyond this initial back and forth, she never came to check on our table. The appetizer we ordered (spinach dip) didnt arrive for more than 25 minutes as other tables around us received apps, drinks, and even entrees.

Compared to my first nights disaster elsewhere, we were treated to our first real chargrilled oysters that seemed to be something special. I left this review sit for 6 days to compare all the other places I had oysters at and I must say this is my #1 pick for the chargrilled oyster.\n\nCompared to other places who use shredded Parmesan, I found these to be the best with FINELY GRATED Parmesan on top of a garlic butter bathed oyster. You could see the oyster clearly with that nice mound of finely grated and melted Parmesan on top. It wasn't buried under a thick blanket of cheese where all you tasted was cheese.\n\nAll the flavors together worked well including the clean taste of the oyster and most importantly no grit in your oyster. Nothing ruins a great oyster experience more than taking in that oyster and then CRUNCH...CRACK, and you are left starring at the person across from you wondering \"should I spit it out, try to take it out gracefully between my fingers and leave the good part, or just pick up my napkin for the full KAPOOEY in the napkin experience.\"\n\nThankfully, it was all oyster goodness.  \nOn top of having great oysters they infuse their own vodka and make their own Bloody Mary mix. I had one with my oysters being it was 11 O'Mary in New Orleans. I was really impressed at how good it tasted along with the various garnishes. Clearly making your own mix fresh and using vodka from your own infuser makes a huge difference (as it should).\n\nMy vote for the best chargrilled oysters out of half a  dozen other places tasted during my visit. I am sure there are others out there in this town of oysters but this is a sure bet on the list.\n\nConveniently on Royal Street you can't miss the signs on the corner of Royal and St. Louis.\n\n5 stars", "date": "2019-03-22 22:23:01"}

My crawfish ravioli was satisfying but I thought it was going to be a little more special. I liked the spinach dip. And the staff was friendly and down to earth. We came here because my husband googled the \"the best shrimp and grits in New Orleans\", originally I was going to give this 3 stars because I hated them. But my husband enjoyed his food and I realized different southern states in the Mississippi delta clearly do and see shrimp and grits differently. I'm not a fan of this restaurant's interpretation. The grits were scooped on to the plate like mashed potatoes instead of being creamy they were thick and chunky. The sauce was more tangy than I'd like and had a sweet aftertaste that I didn't like at all. So decide for yourself, but I'm definitely an Alabama shrimp and grits girl.

Decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by Jessica M.\n\nSo, Jessica M. She must've had a really long day of work at the bar. She was rude, mean and made us feel as if requesting for extra ketchup or hot sauce was a burden. She slams the kitchen door next to us after receiving our request and gives a big sigh.  After dinner  was done, I mentioned the yelp review and she was so upset. She slammed the door once again, in an effort to look for the manager. Once the bill was ran, she again slammed the check, upset because she was unable to find a pen.\n\nNow, the food. We ordered crab claws. They came out cold and was plated with 5 claws. For 13.50 and 5 small crab claws? Ridiculous. Crawfish ravioli. Again, cold.  Barely any sauce and ravioli hard and dry. Shrimp po boy was okay. Charbroiled oysters can't go wrong. \n\nOverall, I was very excited to come here. I'm not from here and received lots of recommendations, but this place failed.

We were seated quickly, but that's where the good service ended. Once at our table, it took over 20 minutes to get anyone to acknowledge us. Once we got a waitress, we put in our entire order, worried that if we didn't, we may never get our food at the rate it was going. My friend and I both ordered a drink that was not very good but the waitress never came back upon delivering it so we didn't say anything and added Splenda and drank it. She never even asked if we wanted another drink after that... At this point it was around 9:30 pm and not busy in the restaurant. Our crab claw appetizer came out first and that was pretty good! A good amount of claws to share for 2 people and the French bread was great to dip in the sauce. Again, our waitress dropped off the food and disappeared for about 30 more minutes. Finally, we got our meals. I had jambalaya that was pretty bland and my friend ordered the crawfish ravioli which totaled about 5 ravioli that didn't look completely cooked. I had to wait about 10 minutes after my dinner came until I made eye contact with the waitress and I could ask for hot sauce. Neither of us were satisfied and didn't even get desert as we had hoped to because the menu looked awesome. We were very underwhelmed by the entrees and disappointed with the service, feeling like we were a burden to our waitress and that she could care less. Worst part - we were mis charged for our appetizer but our waitress never came back once she dropped off the bill.", "date": "2019-04-06 04:47:54"}

We're in town from the west coast for my 40th birthday, mind you. We all order and our dishes came out. I ordered the red beans and andouille sausage and my friend had the shrimp creole. Both our dishes had rice and the rice was hard and crunchy. We sent our dishes back to the kitchen because we weren't satisfied. Our dishes came back out and my friend's dish was good this time, mine wasn't. I got the attention of the waitress and let her know, I decided I wasn't going to try for a 3rd try. I was going to order a different dish and they weren't even trying to take care of my meal for the inconvenience. The waitress then came back and said that they would take care of half of my replacement dish. That was not acceptable to me. We asked for the manager \"Ms. Shirley\" and her first words when she got to her table we're \"ok, what's the issue\". Her approach was totally off and there was no sympathy what so ever. Like it was my fault the kitchen can't make rice in a creole restaurant. We let her know that her tact and technique came across very wrong and she didn't agree and walked away. I then decided to just cancel my replacement dish, I didn't feel comfortable eating there after all of this. As a consumer/customer you shouldn't feel as though you are the problem or feel safe eating somewhere because you spoke up about poor quality.\n\nI'm updating my post from last nights issues. The manger Michael responding to a friend's email about our experience from the night before and wanted to invite back to apologize in person and also give them an opportunity to make things right. We decided to give them a chance. We arrived and shown to a table. Michael came out and introduced himself and apologize for the actions and behavior of his staff.

The food was delicious (we got the crawfish ravioli). The service, however, was completely atrocious. The food took FOREVER and the server chose to help everyone except our table. Once the food came, she never once checked on us. We ended up requesting a manager to let her know, and my friends said she saw the server ROLL HER EYES while we complained of the poor service. Whatttt? \n\nHowever Shirley, the manager, redeemed the 0 star review. She truly listened to us and offered us a free entree to make the experience better during our next visit. She was so incredibly kind and understanding and told us we deserve a true royal experience. \n\nHowever, I will say- the night 2 food was less than bragging -worthy. I got the fried oysters and could barely finish it because it was sooooo greasy. \n\nOverall, I'd say it wasn't the best and wasn't the worst. The 4-star is because of Shirley, the manager.

What really made this trip disappointing is that my experience started to match some of the negative reviews I read. \n\nFirst we order the Crab Claws. We initially came here for fried shrimp and other seafood. When the dish came out I was shocked and appalled any manager or restaurant would let such a measly dish leave the kitchen. The taste was good, but there were only 6 claws in the dish with a very small portion of meat, not worth the expensive price it was sold for! \n\nAfter we finished, we kept thinking , \"What does this mean for the rest of our dishes.\" Our nerves were high. \n\nOur oysters came out with our shrimp platters, so that was a little frustrating. The oysters weren't great, they weren't as hot and buttery as expected (Acme Oyster House has the best so far) \n\nNow on to this shrimp platter. Definitely good in terms of breading (it was light enough to taste the shrimp) but I had so many shrimp the size of my nail-beds, which is completely unacceptable for $19!!! You will be pleased with the overall amount of shrimp; Some were a decent size but the others were embryos so I didn't know how to feel and was confused. Needless to say, the shrimp were the highlight of my experience, a plus? \n\nNice try Royal House, I won't be returning. \n\nBtw our waiter was GREAT!

Our server was so helpful and we were able to place an order of gator bites and receive another for free, which were some of the best gator we tasted during our whole trip.

The Gumbo bowl and fried alligator  missing in the pics as they are small in quantity and they are gone before we clicked pictures. \n\nLouisiana is famous for its seafood and we ordered all seafood dishes. \n\nTried alligator(crocodile) meat for the first time and this dish tasted like chicken popcorn which has more harder meat with same taste as chicken popcorn. \n\nGumbo cup is one of the famous dish in New Orleans as I have seen lot of places with boards saying they serve Gumbo bowls. It tasted more like a sambar rice with different spices. First impression was like this isn't tastes good but after few spoons of that Gumbo rice, it's addictive until you finish the bowl\n\nCrawfish Etoufee - This sauce tasted like sambar too but tasted Like a better version of Gumbo bowl with some fried crawfish meat in it.\n\nSeafood Pescator - seafood pasta with scampi sauce. We substituted marinara sauce with Scampi sauce. This is the best dish at this place. Sauce tasted more like a garlic and butter base sauce. Sauce is so addictive and we were cleaning the plate with side breads for sauce.\n\nShrimp Jambalaya- tastes good with more shrimp in the plate. But other 2 entrees dominated this dish with their sauces. \n\nShrimp Po-boy - typical subway kind of sub with some fried shrimp and veggies. Tastes ok but the bread is so good that we dipped the bread in the Scampi sauce to enjoy that sauce. \n\nWe got a yelp checkin deal to wave off an appetizer and we used it to for fried Alligator.

We were duped. On arrival, I asked about the Yelp checkin for a free appetizer and was told it was valid, and that we could get a free app. We ordered two apps (French onion soup and fried alligator) and a po-boy to share between us. \n\nThe French onion soup was ok, nothing memorable or worth writing home about. It was a little salty but had a nice layer of melted cheese on top. The fried alligator had potential, with decent seasoning and breading. It was, however, very oily and the cuts of meat were not great (I'm assuming all gator meat is not like that, dark and grisly). The po-boy, the reason we stopped by this venue, was terrible. The bread (more like cardboard) was insanely dry. The sandwich comes \"dressed,\" according to the menu, which meant it had lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Apparently this also meant that there was not a drop of sauce or mayo or any moisture inside, which rendered it unfathomably dry. If you could bite into the Sahara desert, I imagine it would taste like this.\n\nAnd when it came time to get our checks, the manager walked over to our table and made us pull out the yelp coupon. He made us zoom in and pointed out the fine print that read \"valid with purchase of 2 entrees.\" Mind you, this text was not visible from the main Yelp page (it just says valid with purchase, the fine print is shown after you click claim offer) and that the waiter had told us our order was fine and we could use the promotion. He told us they wouldn't honor the deal. \n\nIf the food had been stellar I would have let the deceptive marketing tactics slide, but somehow you managed to deliver a double whammy of terrible customer experience and charged me $40 for it. But hell hath no fury like capitalism and a free market with public reviews. I definitely will not be returning and would recommend you avoid this spot too. If you're looking for a po-boy, don't make the same mistake I did and go for the more legit spots (just Google them).\n\nJust as a side note, our server, who said she didn't know about the 2 entree policy, was cordial and apologetic.

We didn't have to wait long to be seated on a crowded afternoon. \n\nFood: 3/5\nWe had really high hope for this place since we wanted to try the famous char-grilled oysters but the oysters were really small. We literally had to scrap off the tiny bit of oyster that was on the giant shell. We also ordered the \"Taste of New Orleans\" which comes with crawfish etoufee, gumbo and jambalaya. I only liked the crawfish etoufee; the other two are just ok. We also got the crab legs appetizer and it was not what I expected. The crab legs are tiny.. like my pinky finger nails; For $13, I don't think it's worth it. The last thing we ordered was the crawfish pasta and I would give it a 3/5 as well. Very creamy and is a good portion but nothing spectacular. \n\nPrice: 3/5\nWe paid around $80 for everything which is not completely horrible but pretty expensive for 2 people. \n\nLocation/atmosphere: 2/5\nThe location is great since it's on Royal and pretty close to the city center. The restaurant is really loud and hot when it's crowded though so it's a bit hard to enjoy a nice meal with all the loud noise.", "date": "2019-09-10 22:42:01"}

However, I didn't feel up to taking the trek to Parkway Bakery for one. I wasn't impressed at all with the food and service at this place. Our server hyped up how their French onion soup was the best in the French Quarter as well as their po boys. My sister and I were excited, ordered a bowl, and was highly let down. It came piping hot, looked good but, was very salty and didn't have a lot of flavor other than salt. I'm glad my server took it off the bill after he saw that I barely touched it. We checked in and earned a free appetizer which, we chose their spinach dip. It was okay but, I have no idea why the chef sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of the chips rather than bake it on top of the dip itself. We thought that was so odd. They give you way too many chips for the amount of dip they give you but, whatever, it was free. All of the food arrived separately,  with an excessive wait time in between. One particular waiter was walking around talking, joking with other employees, cursing outloud, and dropping the \"F\" bomb while we ate. We just looked at each other. We had no clue what his problem was. Now, for these amazing roast beef po boys...NOPE! I ordered my sandwich \"undressed\" and pickles on the side and they came with fries. I believe my sister's was dressed. However, both of ours was mostly all gravy bread. We looked at each other shocked. These things barely had any meat inside with some stray onion pieces in it. Their bread was fresh and good, though. Their gravy tasted like Franco American beef gravy from the can. I was so disappointed in this place. I could've made a better one at home. As I was leaving, I just looked annoyed at our talkative waiter. That entire meal should've been given away for free. Next time, I'll follow my first mind and go to Parkway Bakery, like before. Sadly, I will not be returning on my next trip.", "date": "2019-09-14 13:35:50"}

Cockroaches \n\nOkay. I decided to take a few days before writing this review. We were in Nola for three days after the LSU game. The place was nearly across the street from our hotel and always seemed to have a line during the dinner hours. It had a 4 star yelp rating so we decided to give it a go.  \nWe walked over and were told by the greeter there was only a 10 min wait despite the long line outside. We decided to forgo another reservation and wait. \nWell, ten minutes turned into forty. We were finally seated and when the waitress arrived, she let us know that she was having to be a server and runner. (Interestingly there was a 40 minute wait but there were three to four other open tables when we got to the upstairs dining room.) \nWe ordered appetizers and waited, and waited some more. Apps arrived. Crab claws had good flavor but were tiny. Spinach dip was decent but only a handful of chips were supplied.  Dinner order was placed and we inquired about getting more chips.  Waitress said there would be a $2 charge which we said that was fine and ordered them.\nAfter asking another server, and ours again, the chips were still not delivered. Our waitress brought them as we were nearing the end of our dinner. Then she seemed surprised we didn't want them anymore. \nAbout the time our entrees came is when we saw the first of FOUR COCKROACHES during our time at the restaurant. The first one was very large and crawling across the middle of the wall. I understand these buildings are old, but it was gross. At least three servers saw and kept on walking.  \nThe food itself was fair.  \nWe ordered: The Taste of New Orleans.  Bland, flavorless -essentially all dishes tasted the same,  the spinach salad - which was fine, the fried shrimp - quite small and dry which seemed either overcooked or not fresh, and the crawfish ravioli. That was probably the best item we tried.\nWe never got a water refill or a check back to see how everything was.  \nIn the men's room is where I saw two more cockroaches. One on the wall and another on the floor just cruising around. That was enough for me to want to get out of this place. On the way out we had one more cockroach sighting on the stairs. \nFood was mediocre at best. Service was poor. The place was gross and I will never go back.", "date": "2019-10-17 04:04:43"}

If you check on my profile I usually only leave reviews if I give the business 5 stars, so this review is my first \"bad\" one since joining Yelp. Let me just say, my BF and I are from Los Angeles and this is MY first time visiting NOLA and my BFs second time. Since we've gotten here I've been pleasantly surprised with how good the food is this town (staying in the french quarter). \n\nHOWEVER...last nights experience was our first \"bad\" dining experience since arriving here in NOLA. Had to happened sometime....its been 3 days after all. \nSOOO first, let me just say that I'm not here to bash anyone. I completely understand that waiters/waitresses/bartenders (and so on)  are people with real emotions and are imperfect! Yes, I get that, believe me. The criticism I have, isnt so much with how the waitstaff treated the customers....its more so the lack of professionalism towards each other IN FRONT of the customers. \n\nFrom what I could gather while listening to the wait staff complain to one another.... the hostess began telling customers that there was only room at the bar and sat pretty much every patron that entered the restaurant after 10pm at the bar. THIS PISSED THE BARTENDER OFF. He was clearly upset and even walked out of the restaurant at one point (don't worry,  he came back).  Buuuut to his credit...he did remain \"polite\" to the customers at the bar. It honestly just made us feel VERY uncomfortable. Like he literally tossed a bill book at a bunch of dishes almost causing them to fall into the floor. \nSince we already ordered we were kind of compelled to stay....afterall, the reviews of the food seemed great. And I will put this out there.... the bartender didn't seem like he was receiving any help from the other wait staff.... who were trying to \"close out\" their sections. \n\nLet me give another example as to how \"unprofessional\" the staff was while we were there. A waitress was clearly having issues with one of the men behind the bar. I guess she asked him a question (which I didn't hear) and when he proceeded to give her attitude...she responded with \"BITCH I JUST ASKED YOU A SIMPLE QUESTION\". I could see the patrons at the bars' reactions because of the big mirror pointed at them. Dear God it was getting super awkward at this point (still hadn't recieved food.) And yes,  the wait staff continuously spoke very hostile to each other...over patrons shoulders... during our stay. \n\nFINALLY THE FOOD COMES. And its ridiculously disappointing.  We got oysters (since it's an oyster bar) and I couldn't eat more than one.  It had the fishy-est taste....I pulled like 3 small pieces of shell out off my mouth,  and the breading on top had a mushy and  gooey texture (not baked to perfection like the menu described). And no,  GOOD oysters do not have an overtly fishy taste, especially if they've been cooked.\n\nMy fried shrimp platter tastes fishy as well.  The fries were good, but then again,  they're fries.... you really cant mess those up.  My BF got the tortellini,  which looked overly oily and tasted.....I guess cheap..... would be the best way of putting it.  \n\nOur meal was over $70 and of course I left a 15% tip because I find it extremely unclassy to leave anything less.... the wait staff depends on good tips people!!! Remember that.  Unless they straight up spit in your food in front of you,  please dont leave the waitstaff nothing. But I digress....\n\nOverall,  I can look past an \"ehh\" tasting meal.... but dealing with a VERY hostile wait staff,  made the whole experience pretty bad.  Like I said,  I know we all have our bad days,  but when you work in the customer service industry,  it's best not to let EVERYONE you're \"serving\" blatantly be able to tell your having a freaking terrible day.  \n\nThe curse of the Yelp expectation....I thought this was gonna be another great restaurant on me and my BFs trip,  but is the worst place we've gone to since getting here. Hopefully if you choose to go,  the wait staff has patched stuff up!\n\nPs: the reasoning for 2 stars instead of 1 is because I really don't wanna mess up the restaurant's rating and a 1 star review does.  Like I said in the beginning,  I just wanted to share my story not hate on the staff.", "date": "2019-10-31 12:55:45"}

What I received (pictures attached) was more like pinsers which were many bone with little meat. It was drenched in a creamy-sour sauce that reminded me of an over-spiced (yes, it's possible) thousand island dressing.\n\nCup of gumbo: I was really looking forward to a good cup of gumbo in NOLA. It was just ok. First of all, it came out lukewarm.Little to no flavor and a much more watery consistency than I am used to when it comes to gumbo. The gumbo itself wasn't bad actually, just not what I look for in gumbo.\n\nShrimp n Grits: again, The flavor was ok but not amazing. The grits seemed slightly undercooked to me, and the flavor was really overpowered by an overwhelming amount of Rosemary. The shrimp was well cooked and probably the best part of the dish. This dish also came out cold and I am not one to send things back AT ALL, but I had to request them reheat it. \n\nI think I may have come here on an off night because they have excellent reviews and some of their other pictures really looked great but unfortunately I can't strongly recommend eating here.\n\nWe did receive a complimentary bread pudding which was accidentally brought to our table before our meal which was delicious!", "date": "2019-12-08 20:43:50"}

The presentation of mt entree was fine but the taste of the fish was.. absolutely.. nothing. I am not usually picky about taste at all but when there is no taste? That is when it is different.

I find the red fish a much better dish than mahi mahi. Hope the consistency could be improved.", "date": "2020-01-17 04:14:15"}

We were seated upstairs which  wAs nice since we were waiting for the parade to comE by. While walking up the stairs, we saw roaches crawling all over the stairs but we ignored it. However, our server (white guy with long blonde hair) was just super unprofessional aNd not pleasant. He seemed to hate his job as he just didn't cut it foR us. \n\nAnyways, the food here honestly sucked. And I hate to give bad reviews but it really did and I spent so much money for my birthday celebration. We got a dozen oysters which were not fresh, they were small and not soaked and cleaned. You can taste all the sand and shell bits in the oysters. They didn't give us utensils with the oysters so we were using our forks just to grab some of the cocktail and horse radish sauce. We asked for lemon//lime for the oysters and the server never brought it. We got two gumbo which was okay but not authentic. The half/half special oysters were just too much. Like you couldn't even taste the oysters cos there were too much toppings to even taste anything. The jambalaya was good. It was nicE and hearty. The ribeye wAs also really good, but the sides to the ribeye was over cooked and soggy vegetables. We also got snow crab legs at $30lb and thEy we're not fresh. They were old and just plain bad. \n\nLike I'm just super disappointed in the food I received hEre and I'm mad that I even  brought my friends here. We won't be returning for sure.", "date": "2020-02-03 09:04:25"}

The hospitality at Royal House was no where near the service at other NOLA restaurants. Second, the food was disgusting. Ordered quite a few dishes... across the board all were gross:\n-Seafood stuffed mushrooms: the stuffing was rubbery. Not sure what was in it.....\n-French onion soup: SALTY!! and THICK. I've never had french onion soup as thick as this one. Literally ate the cheese on top and tossed the rest.\n- Taste of New Orleans (Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo): Jambalaya was COLD. Crawfish etouffee rice was like instant rice just thrown on top. The WORST was by far the gumbo. It tasted like a chemical was dropped inside the bowl. We quickly spit it out. Tasted like rubbing alcohol. \n- \"Mashed garlic potatoes\": Unsure how this restaurant considers this dish mashed potatoes. They weren't even mashed... rather they were dried out and salty with some dried out cheese baked on top. \nAVIOD THIS PLACE. There are sooooo many other restaurants in the french quarters. Wasted $70 on this meal---literally all food was thrown out.", "date": "2020-03-02 01:14:28"}

Group of 9 stopped in for a late lunch. Almost everything that could have gone poorly did. \n\nFirst, the place wasn't particularly busy, maybe half full on a late Saturday afternoon. We ordered alcoholic drinks and then our appetizers a bit after and everything seemed normal. It took almost an hour for the appetizers to arrive. Drinks hadn't even arrived yet. We would end up getting them 15 mins after the appetizers came out. Apparently the bar had \"run out of everything\". Everything. \n\nIt took even longer for the entrees to came out, with several additional problems. We got two orders of the ravioli but each one looked drastically different. They didn't even seem like the same order. They entirely forgot one order (which we never endsd ip getting but remained on the bill) and potentially two more on top of that. We waited on the gumbo and the crawfish etoufe\u00e9 and asked someone if those were coming. \n\nThe waiter (not our primary waitress) responded they'll get right on it, implying they hadn't been done? Their rush was apparent because the crawfish had lots of shell bits and the rice was splattered all over the plate haphazardly. There were only 3 pieces of unfried crawfish. The gumbo looked like it was hastily poured from an appetizer bowl into an entree bowl, and was very small portion-wise with very little meat. We had to send the gumbo back. \n\nAnother cherry on top was a waitress (not ours) spilled a tray of waters on one of our people. Another waitress who was handing out silverware napkin bundles had a terrible attitude. For me, she just slapped in onto my shoulder and waited for me to grab it there with my other hand. Lastly, we didn't get a single refill on our water until the end of our 2 hour mess of a meal. \n\nMeal came out to almost $400. At this price point, the service, speed, and food quality/consistency was SORELY lacking.\n\nOverall, reminded me of the worst tourist trap restaurants you'd see in Santa Monica, CA. Our experience was very different from those in Royal's good reviews; it felt like we were in an entirely different place. \n\nAvoid at all costs, you can find better food nearby for cheaper with better service.", "date": "2020-03-08 22:07:36"}

The chargrilled oysters were pure buttery, cheesy flavor and the raw oysters were the largest I've ever seen and very fresh.

Considering the horseradish and cocktail sauce are pretty standard, it might be worth a skip. (Regardless, I still enjoyed - overall the oysters were good but not excellent). The jambalaya & blackened gulf shrimp was tasty, but the baked gulf shrimp tortellini was on another level.

All of the employees wore masks and the tables weren't super close to each other. The staff is decently friendly. Ada was our server.\n\nA lot of the restaurants were closed so this was the place that we liked most (within walking distance from our hotel Omni) for oysters.  Most days they were excellent but the last day they were overcooked (see photos). We preferred the original chargrilled to the other choices. \n\nOn the last day, we were happy to see that they opened early (see sign) because we needed to start our drive home to Texas and wanted one last plate of oysters. We walked up and Ada and staff told us that they weren't open even though the doors were open and the sign was out. So we stood there sweating and waiting but we didn't care all that much other than we didn't think it was great customer service. Not sure what that was about but it was a good send off especially because half of mine were overcooked. \n\nI would definitely check this place out and order the chargrilled oysters, they're fantastic.", "date": "2020-08-18 14:04:48"}

I was bummed.  First, the service was subpar.  Took ten minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the table (and the restaurant was only half full), then another ten to get our waters.  Once we ordered our meal, it took 30 minutes for them to arrive.  We ordered Po Boy's with fries, red beans and rice and jambalaya.  The bread on the Po Boy was stale, but worse, the fries were literally cold.  All I can think is they fried them up, plated them, then waited until the Po Boys were ready instead of waiting for all to plate at the same time.  The Jambalaya was room temperature and honestly, none of us could find any seafood in the bowls.  The only shining star was the red beans and rice...\n\nThe server only came back once and never offered us any water refills.

It almost seems as though there is no system for what tables servers are responsible for, which makes it very easy to lose track of newly seated customers. I would be able to look past this if the food was able to make up for it, but....\n\nThe food was a HUGE disappointment. We ordered the Gulf Fish Beignet appetizer that we got for free by checking in on Yelp.

We were a party of 7 there on Monday afternoon 12/28 around 1:30. We didn't need to wait too long for our table, but that's about as good as it gets.  We were sat upstairs and it took approximately 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server. After someone finally stopped by and asked if we had been helped, to which we answered no, said she ok, I'll just take care of you. She took our drink order and then turned us over to another server. Waters and sodas came out about 5 minutes later...but our beers took close to 20 minutes and that was only after we stopped our first waitress to ask. \nFood orders were then taken. After we asked our server for several suggestions, we should have paid for our drinks and left, she had nothing great to say about the menu. When asked about the gumbo, she said it was good as long as you added your own salt. What about the eggplant. She nods \"no\". Ok then what do you like. No answer. Perfect. We played it safe with soup, salads, and oysters.\n55 minutes later. Lunch was served. \nFifty-five minutes *later* we had our food. Ask me how we know how long it was? Because we had a phone call when the server was taking our order. Now, as we understand kitchens get backed up, but there were only 4 other tables filled. Just let us know if it's backed up. We're reasonable people.\nBut I digress. \nFood comes out. Food runner drops it off and then just, leaves. Thank goodness the host was walking by, saw what happen and gave us our stuff. \nGrilled oysters - barely warm. Closer to room temp. \nSalad - no dressing\nFrench onion soup - very salty.\nDozen raw oysters - and I'm not even joking when I say this, received 12 shells and 11 oysters. Where did the other oyster go and how does one not notice that when shucking?\nFood runner did come back with dressing and an extra oyster. So that was nice. \nAlso we had to ask him because our waitress had pretty much become MIA. \nFigured we ask for the bill while still eating because, you know, time management. \nHad to yet again, find a different server to find our other server to get the bill. \nWe left. We were annoyed, mostly because eating out shouldn't be this difficult. And there are so many other places we could have been.

Let me start by saying I use to be a Chef so I'm very lenient and understanding on lapse in service and mistakes as long as you make things right.  I finally got seated and it took 20 minutes to get water and since it took so long decided to throw in our full order as we could see this was gonna be a a process to get our order.  I'm looking around for our waiter, which I have no clue his name because he didn't say or care to introduce himself or talk at all after our order.  I see him notice we are looking and he has a shocked look on his face.  I know that look it's the look of holy sheet I forgot to put the order in. Mind you that's another 30 minutes in.  So we get our order 15 minutes after that. My fianc\u00e9 ordered Redfish which was good.  I ordered The Sampler and 3 of the 4 items were cold.  I mention to our waiter that it's cold and he takes my plate with no explanation to the back and comes back 5 minutes later with the sampler after they microwaved it, not remade just microwaved.  So at this point. Now we are 70 min into dinner and I'm sitting there looking at a microwaved meal.  I only ate a few bites because the food was still not hot just like warm!!!!!!!  So I just want my check and I want to leave. So I set my timer to see how long this takes after the waiter knew I was displeased with the food and ignoring me.  It took another 15 minutes to check out and I had to get out of my seat and stand around the dining room till I could flag him down.  I'm now 85 min from seating to check out for 4 bowls of microwaved rice!  So I'm writing this eating beef jerkey in my hotel room wondering wth went wrong?  \nI'm in New Orleans of all places and I'm hungry!  I wasn't as mad at the bad meal and lack of service as the disrespect of staff to just ignore me especially since I never even complained just mentioned what was wrong with food.

Our favorite was the etouffee, which had strong seafood notes. However, as we were eating it, we discovered that there was a sugar packet/wrapper in it. I'm not sure if it fell into our bowl or if it had been in the pot and ladled out into our bowl, or what happened.  We flagged down our waitress to let her know, and were a little thrown off guard when she asked us what we would like to happen (we both thought it would be her job to take charge of the situation). After a pause, she offered to bring us a new etouffee or a whole new trio, and we asked for just a replacement etouffee since the other dishes were fine. She brought a new etouffee, apologized for the situation, and checked in on us again to make sure we didn't have any other findings in the new bowl. Also, ultimately she ended up not charging for the taste of New Orleans because of it happening, but unfortunately, the experience was just tainted from finding that in our food. \n\nOn a brighter note, we had requested to sit on the balcony since it was a nice day.

We ate the Oysters Royale and the Taste of New Orleans entree. Everything was so salty and nearly inedible.

Unprofessional.

I almost never post 1 star reviews, but my experience requires it. \n\nMy husband and I got in line for dinner here at 8 pm and were not seated until well after 10 pm. The employees did not have any regard for the people waiting hours in line. There was loud commotion the entire time, with people heckling us etc. NO FOOD is worth standing 2 hours in swamp weather with sore feet, needing to use bathroom, etc. \n\nOnce we finally got inside, things got even worse. I went to use the restroom and it was dirty; I saw a waitress in the restroom and informed her that there was no toilet paper. She shrugged and did nothing. I had to tell other ladies in line to use paper towels because the staff wouldn't refill the toilet paper. \n\nWe ordered entrees and waited another hour for them- I think we finally got dinner at 11pm. My $18 \"taste of New Orleans\" included lukewarm gumbo, cold crawfish etouffee, and slightly tolerable jambalaya. My husband's $16 shrimp po boy was stale and the fries obviously microwaved. The entire meal had the taste and texture of something that had been hastily microwaved.\n\nTake it from me and don't come here, especially if there is a line. Not worth it in the least, I wasted $50 and feel awful about it. The place is a mess, service was spotty, there was no element of hospitality, etc. \n\nMy biggest advice if you're going our to the French Quarter/Vieux Carre in the evening: either eat beforehand in a different neighborhood or secure reservations beforehand (go to Arnauds, Felix's or Antoines instead of this place!!) \n\nAgain I hate to be so negative but this experience wasted 3 hours of our night and put a damper on it overall!

Now the size of the oysters are impressive, but being where I'm from in Vegas, and I don't know if this is just a snobby Vegas thing but the oysters in Vegas are extremely clean.

Do not eat here if you want to feel disrespected or have terrible service before you even step foot in the restaurant. While approaching the restaurant, me and my husband were the ones who greeted the host, not him, I believe his name is Obie from what we were told. He basically just pulled out the clip board and flipped the pages in our faces after we asked how long the wait time was. He said 20 mins and we were fine with that. He then asked for the name and asked US what time it was, so we let him know 8:30pm (give or take). We did not feel welcomed at all the way we were approached, but hey, it's Friday night, he probably had a long day so we weren't mad about, we were just hungry and wanted to enjoy our night and eat. BUT THEN... after waiting some time to be seated, a family of 5 approach and did not get the same interaction. He immediately communicated with the wait staff over walkie to see if there was a seat for 5. They waited BASICALLY NO TIME until they were seated upstairs... on the balcony.... How do I know? Because Obie proceeded to look right at us afterwards, tell us to follow them, and for US to tell the staff upstairs to seat us on the balcony. As we go upstairs, surprise there are no other balcony seats so we are sat at the bar.. in the corner. No big deal, we are hungry so we are going with the flow. NEXT BAD EXPERIENCE, we are given PLASTIC TO GO SILVERWARE instead of actual silverware while everyone around us is given actual silverware. I can see the other wait staff carrying the actual silverware in napkins to tables that were seated after us. We then left because I felt extremely unwelcomed and treated basically like a second class citizen based on the those interactions. I hate to bring race into it, but the family of 5 that got seated before us were White, my husband and I are Asian and we are not sure that COVID-scare racism could have been anything to do with it but I've never had an experience like that in my entire life that I had to walk out of an establishment. I usually brush things like that aside. But we told the bartender upstairs we were going to leave and she was the nicest person we had an encounter with. The host Obie however, not welcoming at all. I was a host a few years ago and I know how it can be, but being in that position before, it could have been handled better from the start. We called the restaurant to let the supervisor, John, know about our experience. He was even is aware about guests being given plastic silverware because staff are \"being lazy\". I don't get how you're aware yet still some of your staff does it to one group of people and other staff give actual silverware? I don't know.

So glad we did! I can't recommend this place enough. \n\nThe restaurant itself is in an amazing 100 year old building that oozes history and charm, & is in a nice corner location. Food was hot, excellent and fresh. Service was friendly & quick. Greg is probably the best waiter we had during our stay in New Orleans. Highly recommended!!!\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n+Blue Crab Claws\n+Bloody Mary\nVerdict - If you like crab, this is the appetizer for you! Warm buttery crab claws already opened and ready to pop in your mouth. Bloody Mary was perfect after a shot of hot sauce!\n\nENTRES:\n+Chargrilled Oysters\n+Oyster Duo\nVerdict -  If you've never had Oysters Rockefeller the Oysters Due is a good plate to try. The oysters Royal were excellent too. The star of the show hover was the chargrilled oysters. Chargrilled to perfection, the warm goodness was paried w/ a little garlic butter & parmesan. So simple yet so delicious...and thats coming from someone who doesn't enjoy raw oysters. Cannot recommend  enough.\n\nSUMMARY:\nEverything we ate was simply perfect. The atmosphere is outstanding...sitting in that historic French Quarter building, listening to the jazz music come in through the open doors...simply perfection...Get the chargrilled oysters...seriously.  Best in New Orleans and we tried them everywhere...Top notch service (Ask for Greg!)", "date": "2021-07-31 18:15:50"}

After touring around the area, we came across this restaurant at the corner. We waited for 35 minutes to get a table, and it was a Wednesday.\n\nIt's a fairly long and narrow restaurant so seating was rather limited. Our table was placed on the edge, so my chair had 2 legs on the floor tiles of the restaurant, and 2 legs were on the actual sidewalk. I didn't mind it too much though, it was a unique experience.\n\nAfter being seated, and ordered, we waited for another 45minute before we got our food. Probably because it was so jam-packed, and I don't expect their restaurant is big enough to serve quickly. But hats off to the waitress there. Knowing the food was coming out slow, she was constantly going around, checking on customers, apologizing, doing damage control, and making sure everyone felt taken care of. She also offered a free drink at the house cause of the delay. Which made the waiting bearable.\n\nThe three of us ordered a dozen of baked oysters to share and individual entries. I had the \"A Taste of New Orleans\" which was 3-4 sample size serving of different gumbo. I rarely eat Cajun food. To me, it was okay. Not completely in love with it, saucy rice?

Waited in line for about 1 hour due to short staff in the kitchen (understable!). Food took another 30 mins but it's okay since they were still hot.  I got French onion soup, chargrilled oyster, and blue claw appetizer. \n\nFrench onion soup: 8/10- The display looks soooo good and the cheese on top was chef's kiss. However the reason why it's not a 10 is due to its heavy salted onion and soup. When I say heavy, I meant heavy sodium. I had to pour about a cup of water little by little to dilute it. Unfortunately, it made my soup cold lol. \n\nChargrilled oysters 4/10: small but I assume it's from the heat. The grainy cheese (don't know what it is called) made it so salty. I wish they put less like what some people were saying below. I tried Desire's chargrilled oysters and theirs were juicy. These were dry and salty enough where you can't taste the natural sweetness. They also toasted the bread so much that It felt like eating crackers- no softness at all. It was hard to enjoy the overall dish. Maybe try their raw oysters instead. \n\nBlue crab claws 8/10: again, this appetizer was great however it was so salty and sour. I used the Yelp offer (for appetizers $13 and paid the difference which was like $5). \n\nGood service. Overall I think they can improve the amount of salt they put in their dishes!

Later that evening, we had a dozen for $19 and the next day we had a dozen for $20. As you can tell I like chargrilled oysters.", "date": "2022-01-03 19:46:23"}

Stumbling onto Royal street, me and my compadre decided to eat at this establishment.  My first time here in years, I decided to try all the appetizers, from the fried alligator, to the blue crab claws, and the Friday oyster tostada's.   The oysters here are some of the best in all of Louisiana.  Fresh tags and all, they are truly the bomb.  Honestly some of the best chargrilled oysters you'll find.  The lemon garlic butter sauce in the blue crab claws will leave you dipping every bit off food one has left over in the sauce guaranteed.   The Royal house is definitely a great spot for a tourist visiting the city in search of good local food at a reasonable cost.  The menu is limited at the moment due to the economic circumstances, but I still had a great time, at the bar so I can interact with all the tourists, near and far.  Had a blast!", "date": "2022-01-03 23:51:56"}

Came around 7:00 with a party of 6 and was told it would be a 20 minute wait time. 20 mins no problem, I don't mind waiting, but it ended up being near a damn hour and half wait. If Walking past the windows I see a huge table that could accommodate 6, but I figured there were other large parties in front of us waiting so I paid no mind. As time went on and more parties were seated, that table was still available. So I don't see why we had to wait 1.5 hours to be seated. Then once seated it took another 45 mins for food to come out. Everything tasted fine except my pescatore. On the menu it said it's supposed to come with linguine, but if you look at my photo that's rice (undercooked rice at that) on top of it instead of pasta. They never told me they were out of pasta or asked me if I wanted to substitute for rice. The sauce was super acidic and tart from the tomatoes. Overall not a good experience, and strongly suggest everyone to not waste their time coming here!", "date": "2022-01-07 18:05:54"}

I'd say it's Italian with a Cajun and Creole twist. It's also a historic building in the French Quarter. We sat on the upstairs outside balcony. \n\nTo drink, my boyfriend had Maker's Mint Julip. It was supposed to consist of Maker's Mark Bourbon, Muddled Mint, Simple Syrup, Soda. After ordering our waiter said they were out of Maker's Mark and asked if Crown Royal was okay...which it was. My boyfriend said the drink was good and different. \n\nI had Voodoo Juice. Cruzan Aged Light Rum, Banana Liquor, Blue Curacao, Pineapple And Orange Juices. It was just okay. \n\nTo eat....\n\nWe started with alligator bites for an appetizer. Marinated Gator Meat Served With Cocktail And Tartar Sauces. It was very tender and had good flavor. \n\nFor entrees we ordered and shared Crawfish & Crabmeat Ravioli and Baked Gulf Shrimp Tortellini. \n\nCrawfish & Crabmeat Ravioli- Jumbo Ravioli Filled With Lobster, Shrimp, Spinach & Ricotta, Topped With Creamy Louisiana Crawfish Sauce And Saut\u00e9ed Blue Crabmeat. DELICIOUS. Nice pieces of seafood and lots of yummy melted cheese. Huge raviolis. Amazing flavor. \n\nBaked Gulf Shrimp Tortellini- Gulf Shrimp Tossed In A Seafood Cream Sauce And Topped With Toasted Buttery Bread Crumbs, Then Baked To Golden Perfection. YUMMY!!! What a wonderful marriage of flavors. \n\nFood was delish. Service on the other hand wasn't terrible but needs improvement. Our waiter was very slow in taking our order, even when we told him we were ready to order he said that he had to go down to the bar. He then took a very long time to come back to take our order. We kept seeing him walk around..just didn't come to us for a while.", "date": "2022-01-09 13:57:39"}
