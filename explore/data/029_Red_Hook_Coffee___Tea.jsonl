Grabbed a menu and brought it home. It looked like they had a lot of vegan and gluten free options and even encourages you to customize the menu, so my roommate and I decided to order dinner from here! We called 1 hour to close (we live a few blocks away) and while I can't remember what she ordered, I know that I got the BLT + A. Everything was fine and dandy until we got there and realized it's cash only (I know, I'm one of those people but it's 2017! Come on!) So my roommate goes to take out cash and I noticed the bill was incredibly high. I asked to look at the receipt and see we were charged an EXTRA $2 for EACH sandwich for the avocado. I asked the woman at the front what that was for, and she pointed to a sign on the counter that said that avocado would be a $2 upcharge because of demand or something like that. So, let me tell you that both sandwiches are ALREADY made with avocado, with mine having \"avocado\" in the name. How are you going to charge $2 for a few slices of avocado on a $6 sandwich? That makes no sense. I would understand if I added avocado to an existing sandwich that didn't already have one, but the $6 price already reflects the cost of the avocado. My second qualm here is that when we called, WE WERE NEVER TOLD OF THE UPCHARGE! I would have gotten something else with no issue. \n\nWhen both of these points were raised to the extremely rude worker at the front, she scowled and gave myself and my roommate and attitude. I asked for the manager and she said that they were not there and \"even if they were here, they would say the same thing.\" Words cannot describe how incredibly rude this woman/girl...I'll call her a girl...was to us. No \"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. Unfortunately this is our current policy. I'd be happy to remove the avocado for you if you wouldn't like to pay\" or anything pleasant of the sort! We left without the food. \n\nSo that was the one bad apple. However, I decided to give it another try yesterday morning because I really do love gluten free and vegan foods. This experience was significantly better. I essentially took like 5 things off of the menu in other items and created my own \"concoction\" and they were very accommodating and helpful! They even made the thing look pretty, too! \n\nOverall, I think I will be back...just not at night when that awful person is there.
