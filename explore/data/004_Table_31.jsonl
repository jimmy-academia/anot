We thought it would be awesome to chill and hang out in the open air, so we asked a bartender if we could sit anywhere.  \n\nWe sat down in a booth, and 3 servers walked back and forth past us, made eye contact, but no one came over.  They then stood 15 feet from us talking amongst themselves, again looked over, and still no one comes over. In the meantime, the bartender we spoke to was talking with someone that looked like a manager, who also looked at us a few times, but made no attempt to come over. \n\nWe finally had enough after sitting there for 10+ minutes with no greeting, so we got up to leave.  As we walked past the original bartender, we told him we were leaving because no one took care of us, and he was genuinely apologetic.  The wait staff shrugged and claimed they didn't know we were not being waited on, yet no one made an attempt to ask us to stay and make up for the horrible service.

We had a larger group reservation and they took us to their private back room dining room on the second floor. Walking through, I felt like royalty. It had strong lounge-feel vibes and the darker lighting and red decor theme gave me really high expectations. The dining room I believe is traditionally used for meetings because of the TV on the wall and board room-esque seating, but we were happy with the view.\n\nWe started the night with cocktails and also ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. This is where the night started to go downhill. The cocktails were not as good as people raved. My Ginger Kiss and my friends Comcastini tasted very watered-down and for lack of better words, cheap. Our stomachs started rumbling and we went right to ordering.\n\nI went with the pasta a la norma and got a large platter of antipasto misto for the table for appetizers. The wait time was noticeably long, about 25 minutes before we actually saw some food. I will say, the portions are huge. The pasta was sized like an entree and I was able to give multiple people at the table a good portion to taste. However, it was very simple, something I'm sure I could throw together in my own kitchen. The antipasto was also very pretty, but nothing special, just a bunch of meats and pickled veggies on a wooden platter.\n\nFor the second course, I got the wild black cod. This course was miserable. I still have no idea what it was, but there was something in the oil that the fish was fried in that gave it a very very undesirable aftertaste. It was similar to the effect of adding too much MSG, but my tongue wasn't tingling. It just felt like I was whiffing wafts of salty, spicy air. I couldn't take more than one bite a minute. The celery root puree was also strangely flavored. Both me and a friend noted it tasted very similar to cup noodle seasoning packets and it just wasn't impressive at all. The presentation was beautiful, but that's it.\n\nThe dessert was also not impressive. The flavor of the semifreddo was okay, but it was so frozen that it was hard to cut through and the berries in the middle were rock hard. Definitely not an ideal finish to the meal.\n\nAnother thing to note was the music. I noticed it right away as we were ordering drinks and all I could hear was, \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\" The remainder of our night was accompanied with 70's and 80's pop music, which definitely wasn't fitting with the decor. \n\nFood was definitely not worth the price. Cocktails weren't amazing. Ambiance was awkward. I might come back for sips if I'm around, but that is about it.

If you didn't laugh, you would cry because each course was somehow bad.  While eating my food, I thought to myself \"this food is on par with Chili's or TGIFriday's\".\n\nTable 31 reverse engineered restaurant week with the thought process of \"ok each person pays $35, how do we profit from that?\"\n\nFor our first courses, we ordered carpaccio and lasagna.  The lasagna was dry as it must have been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour or two.  It was on par with cafeteria lasagna.  As for the carpaccio, it was the coup de grace of the meal.  I would rate carpaccio as my top 10 favorite dishes.  In fact, my wife looked at all of the restaurant week participants and picked Table 31 as a surprise because she knows how much I love carpaccio!  I love the raw red meat, sliced so thinly that you can cut it with a fork.  \n\nThe waiter puts the carpaccio in front of me, and at first I thought that they forgot to put the carpaccio on my plate.  I realized that the carpaccio was white and blended into the plate.  It was plated with arugula, parmesan and a vinaigrette.  I am guessing it was pork, but honestly it tasted like turkey lunch meat.  The edge of the slices of meat were brown which meant to me that it was cooked somehow, and it tasted as if it was oven roasted.  The flavors did not blend well at all.  If someone gave me a plate of lunch meat and a salad, I may have preferred that over the carpaccio I had.\n\nNext, we ordered the oven roasted chicken, the eggplant parmesan and a side of meatballs.  My wife's chicken was actually pretty good.  My eggplant was piping hot.  I could not touch it for about 5 minutes.  After waiting for a while, I finally took a bite and it burned my mouth a little bit, so much so that it took me another 5 minutes to actually taste eggplant.  The meatballs had way too much garlic.\n\nFor the dessert, we had the chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and panna cotta.  The chocolate creme brulee stunk.  We didn't even finish it.  Who doesn't finish chocolate!  My wife actually said \"I mean, this doesn't taste good.  I feel like I am wasting calories by eating this.\"  With the panna cotta, it was ok not great.  The funniest thing about the whole meal was that on the panna cotta, they plated an assortment of fruits that were cut in half.  We got half a blueberry, not a full blueberry but a half a blueberry!  Who does that!  If the restaurant is too damn cheap to splurge on blueberries, then don't plate them!!!!!!  Oh and the blackberry was cut in half length wise, very weird.\n\nThis was probably the worst meal that I have eaten in Philadelphia in the 10 years that I have lived here.  And it cost me $150!  I am not that much of a foodie snob, but the meal was so bad that I was forced to create a yelp account to complain.\n\nPlease do not waste your time and money on Table 31.  There are so many great restaurants in Philly these days that are 1000x better than this place.\n\nIf you like:\n-Lunch meat and salads\n-Mouth burning food\n-Garlic\n-Wasted calories\n-Half of a blueberry\n\nThen by all means, don't let my review discourage you.", "date": "2012-10-12 01:17:07", "user": {"name": "Mark", "review_count": 1, "yelping_since": "2012-10-12 00:47:24", "elite": "", "average_stars": 1.0, "fans": 0}}

The quality of food varies from decent to well below average to being served cold black coffee. I think they're trying to cut a lot of corners lately and just ride out a previously well-earned reputation of being a nice Philly spot for fine dining, but that Table 31 is long gone and all that remains now is a very transparent attempt at being something they are clearly not.\n\nI thought the hostess up front was rather rude, first pointing out that a friend of mine wasn't dressed appropriately but that she would need to check with her manager to see if it was a forgivable offense. Is that the actual restaurant policy? Last I checked, when your business is sitting around completely empty, and five people who were decent enough to make a reservation show up, you seat them with a smile, not a stop sign, regardless of what color shoes or pants they're wearing. Luckily the manager has half a brain and motioned that it was totally cool, but the pretentious hostess still felt the need to educate us on how to dress at a fine dining establishment. Clearly, she needed a way to feel important. Glad we could help.\n\nThe food was unfortunately pretty inconsistent. We had some decent appetizers and that was about as far as we got. The entrees were all over the place, some being completely offensive, others being decent, and the rest just showing some laziness in preparation.\n\nWe continually had to ask the waitress to come back to help us since she was focused on pandering for her tip at a table of old rich people. \n\nLater we were handed serving spoons for eating our desserts, which in retrospect, I wish I hadn't ordered because it was forgettable at best.\n\n\nDefinitely will not come back, and will also mention to others that it's not worth going to.", "date": "2012-10-01 00:30:30", "user": {"name": "Rizwan", "review_count": 199, "yelping_since": "2011-06-18 11:57:49", "elite": "2011,2012,2013,2014,2015", "average_stars": 2.93, "fans": 13}}

I somehow had gotten in my head that they were getting a bad rap, and that I was going to love it... but the service was just too horrible.  \n\nA group of 6 of us were there for a friend's birthday celebration.  It was on a Wednesday in the summer so we were there during Center City Sips, but were passing our time at the inside bar which doesn't do Sips before our dinner reservation in the Table 31 dining room. We had a lovely time at the bar, but everything went bad when we went to the hostess stand to be seated for dinner.\n\nThe hostess was condescending and rude.  She handed out the dinner menus while we were standing there to be seated as she stated that we would have to order from the dinner menu which is more expensive than the bar menu..  The implication seemed to be that we couldn't afford dinner..?  The waiter also got in on the poor service act stating us that he would need the table back in two hours.  I'm not sure what sort of establishment tries to hurry dinner guests along, but we should have left before we were seated as the evening would have gone better for everyone involved if we had never stepped into that dining room.  The waiter was ironically slow and despite our best efforts to eat and get the heck out of there, dinner still took an hour and a half.  Well below his two hour request, but we couldn't get out of there quick enough.  He was condescending throughout our dinner and unattentive and he should not be in a part of the food service industry that requires him to deal with customers. \n\nI don't understand what could have have happened to make these folks look down on our group of 30-something professionals, so I can only assume this is how they treat all their customers.

Loved it.  Came here for a biz lunch and I can't wait to come back in the spring when their outdoor space is open for dining and drinking.  They bring out bread and an amazing red pepper and oil spread to start you off.  I ordered the Insalata Funghi..delicious salad that comes with a black truffle vinaigarette that is absolutely to DIE for..tomatoes, mushrooms, mixed greens and shaved parm.  In. L.O.V.E.  My dining partners got the Cobb Salad (it looked decent) and the sirloin burger with cheddar cheese and carmelized onions.  I almost climbed across the table to get a bite, but of course that's not appropriate in any case. So I refrained.  I will be back so so so soon! Only reason why this place gets 4 stars and not 5 is that it's pricey..$70+ for a 3 person lunch..plus tip.

Waited 20 mins for our server, asked about the menu selection 'he responds and says 'this is an Italian restaurant\n2.)  The waiter left us and did not take our order and did not inform us that he was busy and was going to switch us to another waiter\n3.) Our new waiter came 20 mins later\n4.) Ordered our main course and it tool 40 mins for the main dishes to come\n5.) The main dishes were cold and then we called over the manager\n6.)  The manager offered to warm the food up instead of cooking us a fresh meal (We had: 2 beefs and tilapia)\n7.) We had to tell the manager we wanted fresh food, I really think the manager was drinking the alcohol at the bar\n8.) The old server was kissing our buts when we reported them\n9.) Our bill was not comped in anyway for the bad service and food we received\n10.) We requested the bill and it took is 20 mins to get the check\n11.) After we were ready to pay again the waiter was no where to be found!!!\n12.)  So we put our clothes on and proceeded downstairs, to pay (I felt like I was at an all- you- can buffet paying for my check!)\n13.)

The food was great for the price. I enjoyed it all. I got the salmon app (but I substituted the potato salad for just regular salad), the seared salmon, and the budino. I tried the hazelnut cake too. My main criticism is that EVERYTHING IS TOOOO OILY,BUTTERY, AND SUGARY! It is really tasty food, but I think anytime you add that much oil, butter, and sugar food HAS to be good. I actually had a coating inside my mouth I think from all the excess. That being said, I really did think my food was well cooked, especially the salmon main dish, which I would never normally get, but I wanted the barlotto and didn't want to be \"that girl\" that keeps switching the menu around. The hazelnut cake was more of a ganache on a hazelnut crust which was quite tasty. My friend's risotto was waaay to creamy and almost soup like, but again very good. I would also like to say the wait staff was very nice and I enjoyed the ambiance.

After reading the reviews of other Yelpers, I was slightly concerned...but found room to joke with my boss about the \"cougar\" reputation.  We arrived and were seated right away.  First server was initially attentive and seemed to think quite a bit about himself.  He was mildly offensive as I ordered wine.  He felt the need to try to correct me on what I ordered.  I used the winery name and he told me it was different.  Little did he know I've actually been to the winery in Napa Valley and I felt pretty confident in what I was ordering.  Anyway, I had mussels for an app in white wine cream sauce that were pretty darn good.  Also had the braised beef short ribs for dinner and they were done well, tender and full of flavor.  Could have done without the dry, crispy garnish.  There was way too much and added very little to the appearance, nothing to the flavor of the dish.  Throughout the night another waitress would stop by and tend to our needs.  Very confusing as to who we were dealing with.  They had no communication as they would both come by and ask the same questions.  One good server is better than two average ones.
