We decided to grab dinner here before the flyers game. Reservations at 530, left the restaurant around 630 and got to the stadium by 7. It can be difficult to find parking in this area, but there are a good amount of spots open on broad st as long as you don't mind walking a bit.\n\nExtremely small and very intimate restaurant. If I were to guess, I'd say it can only seat 30 people. Service was outstanding and very professional.\n\nAppetizer we ordered the grilled octopus with cold potato salad. 10/10 my mom wished she ordered this as her entree! Octopus was grilled to perfection, very tender and flavorful. The cold potato in the lemon sauce was a very nice touch. This was on the special and I highly recommend ordering it! \n\nMy mom ordered the Spaghetti alla scoglio. Very generous portion with seafood and the white wine sauce was light that it made eating this so easy. There was a tiny kick in this dish. 9/10. I ordered one of the specials, which was grilled swordfish w/calamari and shrimp, potato and zucchini. Extremely tender and fresh. Cooked perfectly and I have zero complaints. A lighter and healthier meal, and extremely filling 9/10\n\nThe star of the show was my dads entree, which was another special. He ordered the lamb osso bucco and wow *chefs kiss! The pasta was handmade and absolute perfection. Meat was tender and fell off the bone. The red sauce was not extremely strong, but also not weak. Had the perfect balance with a lot of flavor. This was 11/10 amazing! \n\nFor dessert, we all shared the tiramisu. This was the only dish that was just okay. Flavor was all there but the cream was frozen. We thought it was ice cream at first. I prefer my tiramisu soft and creamy rather than frozen. Still solid dessert.\n\nHighly recommend this restaurant and I will be back!", "date": "2021-11-17 18:13:34", "user": {"name": "Phylicia", "review_count": 256, "yelping_since": "2020-06-24 18:18:23", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.62, "fans": 10}}

I've eaten here many times and since meeting my husband it has become one of his favorites as well.  Consistently delicious.  I was raised by an Italian immigrant and the food is up to my uber-high standards for food from the Old Country.  I've picked L'Angolo for several birthday dinners over the years.\n\nA friend who lives in MD got to know and love L'Angolo during his time as a student at Penn, and he and his family recently drove up from MD for dinner.  They were desperate for a Covid break and decided a 3 hour drive to have dinner was worth it.

We were a party of 6 and had a reservation for 8pm.

To start we had some appetizers to share: fresh mozzarella caprese, the spiedini, and the grilled shrimp and calamari. I really wished the portions of the appetizers were bigger, especially the grilled shrimp and calamari because it was just so freakin' good. But at L'Angola, you really don't have to worry about portion sizes, because they make sure you're fed, all right. For our entrees, a couple of us ordered the lamb ossobuco special, which was an enormous large shank with the bone still sticking out, with house made pasta on the bottom. Our group also had the shrimp and parppadelle special, the gnocchi, spaghetti scoglio, and the fish of the day which was a swordfish.  The servings were huge, and everything was authentic and delicious. By the end of dinner, everyone was so stuffed. But we still made room for dessert and shared two chocolate tortes, a cannoli, and tiramisu. My favorite was the chocolate torte but have to say the tiramisu was pretty good too.
