For the uninitiated, po-boys are a New Orleans creation, an overstuffed sandwich on a french roll which was a relative bargain, hence affordable to 'poor boys.' What used to be a dive is now in the heart of the central business district, which grew up around Mother's while she stayed in place. Did she polish things up to impress her new neighbors? No way, and that's its charm. Magazine clippings, old photos of military men, New Orleans Saints memorabilia, and whatever else was handy, are hung all over the exposed brick walls in a  dizzyingly crooked fashion. The open kitchen is base for a dozen or so line cooks in dress whites. Across the room is a long counter with old-fashioned diner stools that twirl. Sit yourself down and order the the Famous Ferdi Special (Ferdi being the brother of the original owner), stacked sky-high with baked ham, roast beef, debris ( the flecks of meat left in the pan) and gravy, shredded cabbage, pickles, mayo and yellow and creole mustards. Add cheese and it becomes Ralph (Ralph being Ferdi's son). There are plenty of other wonderful options on the menu, like Mae's Omelet (but not a clue as to who Mae is or was), generously stuffed with black ham. But if the clock says lunch or dinner, y'all get one of those po-boys, for sure.", "date": "2005-08-19 19:34:57"}

There was a line out front in the scorching July heat and humidity so we figured it must be good.\n\nOn our first free day after Essence Fest and a wedding, we awoke at noon and walked from our hotel over to Mother's -- arriving in the line at approximately 2:30 pm.  let's just say that 15 minutes later I was willing to contribute toward the awning fund at Mother's in order to save myself the effort of wiping the sweat off that was rolling down the middle of my back into my panties.  30 minutes later we were allowed inside only to be greeted by another line with an approximately 45 minute wait.  At this point, we are committed.\n\nMy first warning sign was the rude hostess who told me that I could not sit down in an empty chair next to the line until I paid for my food.  When I explained that I am partially disabled and cannot stand for long periods of time, I was told I could sit in a high barstool along the side wall.

But we were committed.  Food looked good - especially the cobbler.  \n\nGet to the end of the counter to order - no fried chicken.

Ordered red beans & rice, ham (world's best according to the sign), crawfish etouffee, catfish po'boy and the cobbler.\n\nLots of choices for tables so why the line we ask ourselves?  Take a seat in the back where it is cooler -- wait for our food while overhearing a loud drunk from the bar next door.  Food arrives and the waitress spills some red beans on my new Coach handbag.  Since it is food and I am starving with a hangover, I'm not too upset until I taste the food.  Where is the seasoning?  Red beans and rice needs some Lawry's.  Cabbage is good.  Ham is cold.  Who serves cold ham with a hot plate of food?  Crawfish etouffee is outstanding and the husband wishes he would have ordered a bowl instead of a cup.  The catfish po'boy came on stale bread.

I wasn't too impressed with the grits with debris or the bloody mary, which I found to be lacking absolutely any taste of vodka whatsoever.

My friend, Chris K., ordered the fried combo catfish, shrimp and fries plate and he added the a cup of jerry's jambalaya and crawfish etoufee for $2 more. When I found that out, I felt cheated.

Obviously, he could tell we had a long night.  I ordered the meat and egg biscuit with yoru world famous ham and also the grits with cheese and debris.  My friends ordered similiarly.  We all had a bloody mary as well which was spiced well albeit lacking a premium vodka.  We sat and were brought our food swiftly by a large round faced older women who was as friendly as couldl be.  The biscuit was light fluffy and buttery.  The ham was delicious and as good as any I've had.  The grits were okay, and the debris (roast beef n gravy) was delicous.  I could have ate this all day.  The space itself was historic and beautiful with exposed brick, plenty of old pictures to give us a sense of history and the service was friendly. THank you for starting my 2009 off so well.  In fact, paradoxically I had one of the worst meals of the year for my last meal in 2008 in your city and one of my best so far as the first meal of 2009.  This seems very much to me to hopefully be a metaphor of a new start in all things in 09'.", "date": "2009-01-10 13:50:37"}

I think about 1 1/2 of the stars I knocked off were due to bad advice from other people, so let me start by saying I'll definitely give this place a second chance when I'm back in town with a little more time on my hands.\n\nI went to Mothers for lunch while at a business function a few blocks away, because someone else who'd been here before and was old enough to know said \"If you want the REAL New Orleans, you go to Mothers.\"  That person also said that you had to go for breakfast or lunch because Mothers didn't serve dinner.  ???  When I got to Mothers and finally reached the business end of the mile long line, the sign on the door said they were open 7 am to 10 pm most if not all days of the week, so that was Miss Information No. 1.  Someone Else, let's call him \"Al\" cuz he looks like an \"Al\" on vacation in his doofy shorts and Hawaiian shirt, who was also from out of town but had et here before, said he first came on the recommendation of a taxi driver after he badgered the cabbie \"so where do YOU eat?\"  I don't know what time someone driving a cab would come to Mothers to avoid the line or if there's a secret backdoor or password that locals only know to avoid standing around for an hour for a sammitch, as I understand the line is 30-40 minutes long much of the day, but whatevs.  It's true that Mothers is a dern sight more authentic lunch-counter looking than most of the French Quarter a few blocks away, even if most of the people eating in the joint seem to be from Out of Town Looking for the Real New Orleans. \n\nAnyway, having already walked numerous blocks through a pretty dead part of town, I decided to brave the line, which was maybe back to the parking lot and therefore not bad as lines for lunch in NoLA seem to go.  The restaurant is teeny inside and they let people in by batches maybe 30-40 at a time because that's all they can serve and seat at once.  This explains why I stood there for a half hour watching like 20 people come out but nobody going in to take their place. \n\nI really didn't have much beef with the restaurant - it cant help being popular and indeed I'm sure it's happy about that.  I did start to want to maim the people standing in line around me, none of whom were from the area, and all of whom seemed to be competing in a death match with a group of Vegas tourists for Idiots of the Year Award.  The girl in back of me was wondering if she would be able to order any vegetarian food in Mothers, a restaurant that is widely publicized for its baked ham and other carnivorous dishes.  As it turned out she was happy with some eggs, but standing online for Mothers to get vegetarian food is like expecting steak on the buffet at a PETA convention.  Veggie Gurl and her pals were also fretting constantly about did they come to the restaurant at a bad time, because it was taking too long in their opinion to get in.  Ahead of me there was Al advising Veggie Gurl to try the \"debris po'boy\", which he had had before, and which he explained as being the pieces of meat that fall off the baked ham and land in the grease, so the sandwich is ham and grease, and the grease gives it the flavor, and you'll like it \"if you like grease\".   Although Veggie Gurl was not interested in grease (and in fact thought Al was discussing \"grits\" for 10 minutes till that got straightened out), I thought maybe I would try the \"debris\" as it's supposed to be a specialty of the house.\n\nI finally got in there and placed my order.  It's a nice little funky cafeteria place with a weird no-tipping policy, and all of the staff who took my order and cleaned up the tables and so forth were extremely nice.  I had read before that Mother's featured \"surly\" New Orleans service and given the crush of people besieging the place all day and how hard the cookers and servers were working, I would not have begrudged them an attitude in the slightest, especially having to deal with the likes of my fellow linestanders, but the help was nice as pie.  Absolutely no attitude anywhere, just a lot of honeys and babys and man do I wish I had servers that nice in about 10 other cities.  \n\nI ordered the 2/3 debris po'boy and a cup of etoufee.  Here's where Miss Information No. 2 comes in:  the \"debris\" is nothing like Al described.  It is basically hash in some kind of weird vinegary tasting pot likker.  It is not particularly greasy, nor particularly flavorful either unless you want to drench it with Tabasco or salt (unfortunately the shaker at my table was empty). It is not identifiable as ham but rather tastes like boiled mystery meat with mustard on it and a way soggy bun, like something you'd get at a bad school cafeteria.  In short, not worth a 40 minute line stand at lunch.  The etouffee, by contrast, was A+ five star excellent and I wish i'd just bought a big bowl of that instead, which I will do someday when I give Mothers another chance.", "date": "2009-03-08 22:35:17"}

As you inch towards the cashier, you will pass the meal assemblers and their buffet of saucy ingredients.

After we ordered, my friend and I claimed a table in the large rear seating area.  A friendly, older woman greeted us and promised to deliver our meals in a prompt manner.  Our sandwiches quickly arrived; however, mine was not assembled as ordered.  My chicken was fried, and it was laced with mayo as well.  Apparently, I had been correctly forewarned regarding my customization.  The gracious server apologized and promised to do her best to get me the right sandwich as soon as possible.  Of course, it was then returned to me as the requested grilled chicken version but still with the fatty condiment.  At this point, my friend had already finished her entire sandwich, so I just wound up scrapping off the mayo.  Sure it was an annoyance, but the marinated chicken and doughy French bread still delighted me.  The perfectly grilled chicken was covered in tasty cajun spices.  My friend had ordered the Famous Ferdi Special, a savory blend of Mother's renown ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy.  The \"debris\" referred to the beef shreds that fell into the juices upon roasting.  The sandwich was an oozing mess of marinaded tender meats.  Each bite provided a mouthful of hearty, down-home flavor.  \n\nSure Mother's is a no-frills restaurant, but the real experience it provides is priceless.", "date": "2009-05-19 17:35:37"}

The bread was nice and fresh, but this sandwich is not going to change your life.\n\nThe jambalaya was better - very flavourful with chunks of andouille sausage.

I can't stop thinking about Mother's.  I can't!  This place haunts my dreams.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and that sucks, because it's very, very far away.\n\nOk, so, you gotta walk up-town if you're staying in the French Quarter, which trust me, is a blessing, because you need to burn this shit off, otherwise you'll die.  I mean it would take 4386460 walks from the FQ to uptown to burn this off, but the one walk helps.  We got to mother's and waited in line, which we were aware would happen.  Fine, you know what, we're on vacation.  A little line doesn't bother us.  We didn't have anywhere to go, and the best thing about new orleans is, you can drink on the street.  So, I walked down to the corner liquor store, got us two huge miller lights, brown bagged them, and we enjoyed those in line.\n\nThe line moved quickly, and before we knew it, we were presented with a very difficult question, what to order.  We thought about it and thought about it, and went with the cajun sample platter (crawfish etouffe, red beans and rice, jambalaya and a heap of potato salad), a fried chicken po boy, and dirty grits with cheese.  \n\nHere it is, the statement of the review: THE BEST JAMBALAYA OF MY LIFE. I tasted everything else first, and was somewhat pleased, but then that jambalaya hit my mouth, and I knew the amount which was on the sample platter, which was ample, mind you, was not going to cut it.  So, I ordered another cup because I didnt want this jambalaya to stop coming.\n\nThe fried chicken po boy was incredible as well.  I dont know how they do it, but man, that thing is tasty!  The fried chicken was perfect, and the mix of lettuce and pickle and french bread really hits home.  So damn good. \n\nThe rest of the meal was not nearly as exciting as the po boy and jambalaya, so if you want my opinion, stick to those.  However, the crawfish etoufee, if you're an etoufee fan, wont disappoint.\n\nYou must go here and get this jambalaya.  Dont forget the fried chicken po boy either.  And let me tell you, all this deliciousness washes down quite well with a brown bagged miller light.", "date": "2009-05-29 17:45:07"}

There were 3 of us, so we ordered 2 Ferdi and one Jambalaya. Not shockingly, we did not finish it. \n\nThe Ferdi was really good. It was warn, not too hot, and had sauce dripping out. The bread was hard after a couple of minutes, but using my creative mind, I just used the sauce to moisten the break. It was good. The jambalaya was good as well. It had a little kick to it. \n\nThe staff were really nice and friendly. Also, they have a large sign that says \"DO NOT TIP\". Under this sign, it says that the waiters are not allowed to keep tip.

None of us liked it; in fact, we all had one bite and pushed it aside.  It was sour (ketchupy) and that was the only taste you got from it.  Oh, it had good sausage.  That's ALL it had going for it.

The oyster po boy was also ehhh... the oysters just didn't taste fresh and was very seafoody, which makes me gag.\n\nTHE GOOD:  The shrimp po boy was really good.  Really, really good.  Shrimp was fresh and plentiful.  Same goes for the soft shell crab po boy.  I would definitely recommend these.  The gumbo was also good, but seemed quite watered down.  I had HEARD there was a shrimp... ONE SHRIMP in someone's bowl.  Obviously not mine.  No one else had a shrimp :(\n\nEach day we'd see lines of 20-30 people outside of Mother's.

The best thing about Mother's is that it is a great example of southern/creole/cajun food and culture (considering the wait staff and their propensity to call you \"baby\".

It is not really worth waiting 20 minutes or more (outdoors) for this restaurant.  If you can go to Mother's when there is no line (or very short line), very early in the morning maybe, I may be more inclined to rate this 3.0/5.0.\n\nThe waiting and the crowded, chaotic atmosphere is not pleasant and does not lend itself to a relaxing experience.  The food is decent but nothing too special.  The gumbo was very solid (what place in or around the Quarter doesn't have pretty darn good gumbo?) as was the jambalaya and red beans and rice.  Further, for what you get, and after waiting in such a long line, the prices were borderline absurd.  A small bowl of gumbo is $7.95 and most any poboy or sandwich is pushing $12 to $15.

I was in \"Nawleans\" for business reasons and my hotel happens to be close to Mother's.  Not having the guts to venture further away, my co-worker and I walked around to places that seemed safe.  Long lines outside the restaurant is always a good indication that the place serves good food.  We were so hungry that we decided to just go for it.  This is also my first time to try Louisiana cooking.  \n\nAs we slowly moved along the line, we watch how people ordered and what they ordered.  We can even see some people eating their food and the smell and sight just made my mouth water even more.  Lucky for me, everything in the menu is edible and seafood is their main dish.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are huge.\n\nI ordered the Catfish Po 'Boys, Crawfish Etouffee, and their Seafood Gumbo (company is paying for my dinner).  I didn't finish my food but for me it was heavenly.  I don't think any other Cajun places I've been to can compare to Mother's dishes.  The sandwich is fresh and the bread is soft.  The crawfish etouffee was my favorite and I've never had anyplace better.  The seafood gumbo was just to die for.  I really can't believe how unique yet fulfilling cajun food can be.  It just makes you feel like you're home when you eat them.  I just wish I can go back to New Orleans just to have another bite of real cajun food.

On the list with a chain of asterisks highlighting it was Mother's Restaurant. Our friend noted that when going to Mother's, we should not be in a rush. There will be lines, he warned, very long lines, but don't be dissuaded, this place will be worth your while. Right before leaving for New Orleans, we mentioned the restaurant to another colleague, who when hearing the name exclaimed \"You just HAVE to bring me some black ham biscuits!!\" as he threw us a twenty dollar bill and grinned from ear to ear. \n\nWe saved Mother's for breakfast on our last day. When pulling up, we noticed not the building, but the lines of people.  We grabbed a newspaper and sunglasses and eased into what we thought would be one hell of a wait. Thankfully we were handed menus to salivate over while we stood underneath the blistering sun. Much to our surprise however, the line moved rather quickly. Lofting aromas of what would soon be our very own breakfast kept us intrigued. Once we finally got inside, I was momentarily confused about the setup of the place. It looked like counter-service but there were food runners and waiters scurrying around.  We ordered from the counter and found a table. Our server was a boisterous woman who asked for our drink orders and then said \"You know what, I think you two need some of my special juice\". We smiled and said OK. The waitress served us a juice mixture of I'm guessing every juice they had in house and it was surprisingly delicious. Maybe even more so simply due to the hilarious nature of the situation. \n\nThe menu was stocked with mouth-watering treats. We went with the biscuits because we felt it was only right after our fanatic friends' recommendations. Sadly enough they were out of the Black Ham biscuits, something that I now know is an extremely wanted item and in turn runs out quickly. So we went with the baked ham biscuits which resulted in happy bellies all around. The meat was obviously slow cooked and simmered, the biscuits crumbled in our mouths. We even took the 20 dollars of biscuits all 12 hours back to North Carolina to our awaiting friend. Overall Mother's was a delightful experience both food-wise and as far as entertainment. If you're in New Orleans and want to do everything that is indeed New Orleans, you simply must try Mother's.", "date": "2010-03-04 19:26:30"}

Though I hesitated at the thought of consuming any more food as I waddled in my seat, I did take a few bites of Mother's bread pudding which was soaked in a bourbon sauce. This was hands-down the best bread pudding of the four New Orleans-based restaurants where I've tried bread pudding.\n\nNext time, I will definitely have to try the soft shell crab po'boy.", "date": "2010-03-21 13:36:28"}

Its one of those sinful pleasures that you indulge in every once in a while. The food is definitely greasy spoon with a New Orleans twist. The service is great but may take some getting used to.

Sometimes they actually come to your table. I have only been here for breakfast and lunch. I had an yolkless omelet which I guess was ok (I don't think they do healthy well here, so my fault for trying). There was an etouffee omelet (I think) which was awesome. For lunch its basically po-boys. \n\nThey have a back room for meetings which is all brick if the front area seems too full.

My friend Andy touched the sandwich and decided that this can't be what he ordered (it was soggy and didn't have any gravy on it), the waitress came back, asked if he touched it, and when he said yes, rolled her eyes, huffed, grabbed the sandwich and walked away.  Is that all, you ask?  Not so much.  The waitress then came back with two sandwiches, AND a cup of gumbo and some crawfish etouffee.  Remember when I said we just ordered three sandwiches? Yeah.  Anyway, we told her that we didn't order these things, and she told us not to worry about it (despite signs saying not to tip the servers, she told us to tip them anyway, and we could keep the side dishes), then walked away and came back with the other sandwich.  We decided to try the etouffee and gumbo first, and after each of us had taken two bites of each, ANOTHER waitress came to our table, informed us that we hadn't ordered these items, and took them away.  This seemed spiteful, and a total waste of good food, but nonetheless, we had our Po-Boys to dive into, so oh well.  These Po-Boys were not what any of us were expecting, given the raving recommendation from plane guy - the meat was dry and the bread was definitely soggy - but we were hungry and ate them anyway.  I don't often give something a thumbs down after one experience, but everything that occurred was so backward, that I probably won't go back.  Sorry, plane guy, Mother's gets a thumbs down from me.\n\nOn a higher note, the crawfish etouffee was very good, if not amazing.  Woo hoo.", "date": "2010-05-21 16:49:44"}

It's in NOLA's business district which looks more like the downtown of any other city, yet on a hot Saturday afternoon when the area was pretty desolate, the only people I saw were the ones waiting on line outside of Mother's.\n\nWe walked in and saw a big line and a cafeteria-style display of Mother's meats, soups, and other foods. However, unlike what we expected, the display was just a tease and the line was only for placing orders with the cashier. Between the time we got on line and the time we had to order, we had about 5 minutes to go through a massive menu that had too many attractive things to choose from. When I got to the cashier, I spent about a minute muttering various words like po'boys, fried chicken, jambalaya and biscuits without making any sense. I could tell from the cashier's unsympathetic expression that I wasn't the first one to be overwhelmed by choices so I ordered the Ferdi Special po'boy and a cup of seafood gumbo. \n\nAfter ordering, we looked for a table in the deceptively wide-open space. There are 3 dining rooms in the restaurant, and the further you go back, the newer and more sparsely decorated they get. We sat way back in a room that looked like an old warehouse and probably gets used for private parties. After about 10 minutes of waiting, a server took our receipts and brought out our food. \n\nThe Ferdi Special is one of Mother's specialties and is a po-boy filled with the restaurant's amazing ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy...Mother's proudly advertises its ham as \"world's best\" and it is reallly good, thickly sliced country ham. Of course, I was curious about what \"debris\" was and found out it's basically meat drippings from the roast beef slathered in the sandwich..and now I will be putting debris on everything.  Altogether, the Ferdi was like a hammy french dip sandwich with gravy on the bread. What heightened the sandwich into legendary status for me though was the crunch of cabbage, mayo and mustard. I recently discovered how good cole slaw can be on any meat sandwich, and Mother's cabbage concoction added the texture and creaminess that took this po'boy to another level. \n\nThe seafood gumbo was flavorful but for $6.25, the portion I got was really small and kind of disappointing. On the other hand, my friends' breakfast food looked amazing, and the biscuits you get are handmade, big, and fluffy. On top of all that, we shared an order of the decadently sweet bread pudding--one bite was enough for me. \n\nAs we walked out stuffed, shrimp po'boys, fried chicken, and ham from other tables stared at me, tempting me to move to New Orleans to be close to Mother's. The least you can do is pay your respects the next time you visit...and pick up a Ferdi's for me.", "date": "2010-06-03 05:13:10"}

Mothers really should be considered for breakfast or lunch. Beware Mothers is not cheap and can feel pricey for what you are getting. I recommend considering the many other options in NOLA for dinner.  \n\n\nThe food at Mothers is ok and you will feel happy & satisfied. But, the food and service did not blow me away, but I wasn't disappointed. I would eat here again. However, there are other places in NOLA which are way better. \n\nInstead of Mothers I would recommend Cochon Butcher Shop or  Superior Grill on St. Charles. The drinks at Superior grill are really potent and you get your money's worth there. Cochon Butcher shop is not as expensive as Mothers and overall you will more than likely enjoy your food experience much more at Cochon Butcher Shop.", "date": "2010-07-06 04:31:03"}

Mother's is a gem and absolutely worth trying anytime you visit The Big Easy.\n\nMother's is located in a historic building that is (conveniently) across the street from the W Hotel on Poydras.  Your going to wait in a line, probably outside in the heat, no matter what time of day you go - so just prepare yourself.  We managed, so will you.  As soon as you get inside, start checking the menu so you are ready to order.  Because once you get near the counter the action begins and everything moves fast.\n\nEverything on the Mother's breakfast menu is done just right.  I recommend Ham & Cheese, with a homemade biscuit & some southern grits.  Then add a cup of red beans & rice or jambalaya on side - you don't want to leave without trying it.\n\nAside from the great food, the restaurant and staff are totally are worth the trip. Their system for delivering your food is one I've never experienced anywhere else.  You order at counter and when you pay they write something the copy of the receipt they keep.  Then you find your own table from an array of rooms.  Then you wait a little bit.  When they serve your food, you'll see the description (of you) they wrote on your receipt at the counter.  Our group had \"blue shirt\", \"stripes\" and \"moustache\".  The servers just weave through the restaurant until they find someone matching the description on the receipt.  Not the most efficient system, but seemed to perfectly fit New Orleans - and it added a humorous element to the experience.\n\nBest time to try Mother's: breakfast, brunch or early lunch. It will cure even the meanest New Orleans hangover.", "date": "2010-07-13 03:31:10"}

I also got the crawfish ettuffle since that was the only thing I did not get at the Acme Oyster House. OMG ettuffle is delicious. Not too salty, (which was a problem at Acme), it has a broth which probably has a ton of butter and flour (or some sort of thickener), the crawfish cooked delicately with the flavor of the sea from the crawfish influsing into the broth very distinctly. The crawfish was sweet, tender, and fell apart with minimal effort in your mouth. No tough overcooked crawfish here. The ettouffle comes served over white rice, which when you are paying $8.25 for a small cup seems kinda a cheap move. Why cant they give me a whole cup of ettoufle with a side of rice. There's also another meat, most likely a fish in it. Altogether, this is probably the best thing that I had in New Orleans so far. More than anything, this reminds me of a good thick clam chowder, except with crawfish instead of clams. \n\nThe Ferdi Special was alright. The broth was kinda flavorless, and to be honest, the best part of the sandwich for me was the pickles and mustard, which was a good combination with the lightly salty meat and gravy. Correction, the best part is the free pepper oil on the side. It was absolutely awesome. Sweet, sour and spicy at the same time, I ended up killing my sandwich with it. \n\n Well the chicken and sausage.The jambalaya is a bit less salty than the jambalaya at Acme, it also has a bit more of a spicy kick to it. An interesting note is that the sausage here is sliced and the chicken is pulled. I feel that this is a bit better than the other way at Acme. The chicken stays tender and chewable, and the sausage (which naturally has more fat gives the jambalaya an additional component almost becoming a compliment to the dish rather than depending on the rice as a medium\n\nHe jumbo however is better at Acme. The chicken in my jumbo is dry, and the jumbo just isn't as flavorful as the darker jumbo at Acme. There is also less meat in this jumbo. The soup is just thinner. It's not as salty or as spicy. Again, the sausage is sliced thick, but in this case, I like it better chopped up like at Acme. \n\nOverall, I would say that this place makes the Louisiana classics a lot better than Acme. So if you want good jambalaya, entouffe, or gumbo, come here. But dont get the Fergi special. its pretty overrated. sorry travel channel (and subsequently Man Vs Food)", "date": "2010-08-26 15:28:11"}

That sounded like pure gristle to me, so we both went for the $10.75 Famous Ferdi Special, which puts their home-baked ham, roast beef, shredded cabbage, and yes, the debris, together into a soft roll that was then doused in a watery gravy (see photo).

I honestly don't see how any local New Orleanian or even New Orleans transplant could give a positive review of this place.  It is the very definition of a tourist trap, with the ridiculous prices to match.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nEr...\n\nTHE BAD\n\nCombination Platter (jambalaya, etouffee, red beans, greens, potato salad): All edible but nothing special, and you can literally go to ANY place in New Orleans to get this stuff.  What truly makes it bad is that for one 10-inch plate of the simplest food possible, they charge $18.25.  Seriously.  I guess it was my fault for ordering it in the first place because I should have known better, but at the time I visited Mother's I was basically a tourist myself.  I still wish that my buddy who came with me and had been three years into his New Orleans experience had at least given me a warning...\n\nMeat Side Order of \"World's Best Baked Ham\": Not even close.  Nowhere near the ballpark of being the best anything.  I've had better ham from the deli counter at Rouses.  Flavorless, dried-out ham is never good, especially when it's for an unconscionable $5.25 for a small plate.\n\nPURGATORY\n\nService: Half of the employees didn't care and were rude, especially the people taking orders who had absolutely no patience for customers who were unfamiliar with the ordering process (myself included).  Fortunately, there were a couple good eggs in this rotten bunch and their cheerfulness saved an otherwise dismal experience.  I guess getting decent service is a total crapshoot here.\n\nOVERALL\n\nOverpriced, under-flavored tourist trap.  Save yourself the trouble and don't come here.  Maybe their po-boys are good, but I'm certainly never coming back to find out.  It gets two stars instead of one because that's what I would have given it if I had reviewed the place the moment after I ate it, with a tourist mentality, before really getting a chance to experience the finer aspects of New Orleans cuisine.  There is certainly nothing fine about this place.", "date": "2010-09-28 16:24:31"}

Most have been yummy fried seafood sandwiches in great white French bread with lettuce and mayo and tomato. \n\nMother's was recommended by a friend as a place to stop in New Orleans, and while stopping to get our bearings at Poydras Ave, we realized it was right across the street and stopped in.\n\nYou do want to have an idea of what you want when you get in, because you grab a menu and a table and then go up to the cashier and order your food and sit back down.\n\nWe had the Jerry's Jambalaya and a Ferdi's Special po-boy (2/3 size). The sandwich had some pink ham, some black crispy ham, and the very delicious debris, and was \"dressed\" the Ferdi's way. It was very tasty, and quite different from the seafood po-boys I had tried everywhere else. After reading up a bit about po-boys, I think this is a more \"authentic\" take on a sandwich that has now come to mean any large white French roll stuffed and dressed. The 2/3 size was more than enough for this manly eater and still leave enough to share with my girl.\n\nMy girl shared her Jerry's Jambalya with me as well, and damn, it was delicious. After trying a few bland etouffees, gumbos, and jambalayas in the French Quarter, this one stood out as being rich, spicy, and not too spicy.\n\nI liked that they had a sink and soap and paper towels right out in the hallway, if you wanted to rinse your hands without entering the bathroom. It is a nice touch.\n\nSome people have complained here about the high prices and the staff's service. I didn't have any problem with the service, I am used to cafeteria style service at extremely popular spots, and each member of the staff usually has specific duties in order to keep things running smoothly and efficiently. The staff all seem to be in good spirits to me, and I felt welcome. The other thing to keep in mind is that you are forbidden to tip the staff there, so take the 15-20% you should have tipped off of your bill, and the prices are now pretty competitive for food that is authentic and unique.", "date": "2010-10-13 14:32:31"}

The name kind of says it all. What can you say about a staple of NOLA's history. Established in 1938, Mother's survived not only hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but they survived Camile as well. Mother's was the first restaurant to introduce the hero/grinder/sub sandwich to south. Their name for it... the Po-Boy. \n\nThe tour books and some of the reviews I feel don't do the place justice. They have hosted almost every celebrity that has ever visited the city and they have a special place in the hearts for cops, firefighters and military personnel. Parking is tough but they are easily reached by bus or street car, within a few block of the riverfront and the western edge of the French Quarter. \n\nWhile in NOLA for 7 days, I went there 3 times and got the famous Po-Boy sandwiches , with a variety of sides. I've had their famous ham, the Turkey and those in my parties had the gumbo, slaw and fries on the side. Everything, including the fries, are made by hand and are fabulous. They also put stuff in to a Po-Boy that I've never thought to have... shrimp for instance was an interesting filler. They offer a variety of PB's as cold or hot sandwiches was as great as well.\n\nThe dessert menu is limited but they do have some items. Their pecan pie is similar to some of the ladies who work there, big and sweet. We order the PP and found that it may even be too sweet if you were to eat a piece all by yourself. \n\nSeating is OK, most tables are two and four person with one or two big enough for 6 but they don't mind if you pull tables together. They do get busy but are really busy on the weekends. Tourist go there alot but during the work week, its filled with locals too especially at lunch time. My three times there, I waited 5 minutes to order, 20 minutes, and 2 minutes. It all depends on week vs. weekend and time of day. Parking is on the street and adjacent private lots. Best bet is to just take the bus or street cars and walk a few blocks. \n\nPortion sizes are good, bordering on huge but everything is fresh.

Immediately after we ordered, while I was handing the cashier my money, she was yelling at the person behind me to begin ordering. Then she yelled at us to move aside - only there wasn't anywhere to move to, since there were people waiting for their coffee to my right.\n\nThen, when I got to the drinks lady, she said they had just run out of coffee. At 10:00 AM? Ok, poor task planning. Then she tells me to come back in 10 minutes. I thought I heard wrong and asked her to repeat that. Yes, apparently at Mother's, unlike everywhere else in the Universe, it takes 10 minutes to brew more coffee. \n\nThe famous biscuits? Flaky, yes. Overly salted, yes. And, shockingly, the grits are QUICK GRITS. Yes, they are the same crappy grits you get at the grocery store.\n\nAnd the po-boy? I am sure that they don't use Leidenheimer bread, the famed gold standard of po-boy bread from New Orleans. And the meat was pretty tasteless. \n\nFolks, this is not a great sandwich.

It didn't occur to me until I was at the counter and was told this in response to my attempt at ordering a po'boy at 8:30am....fail.... Flashes of Soup Nazi scenes enter my head, I panicked and ordered based on a combination of residual Yelp review memory (biscuit w/eggs and baked ham), geographical specialty (crawfish omelet) and what the person in front of me ordered (breakfast special). \n\nIn retrospect, I could've done with less eggs but altogether, no regrets. The ham was fantastic, and I'm not much of a ham fan. Usually I find it too dry and salty, altogether uneventful. But this wasn't the case with Mother's baked ham.

The line out the door on a Sunday morning was discouraging but moved reasonably briskly (I'd say we waited on line for 25 minutes total).

With that kind of recommendation, how could I really refuse right? So my FIRST night in New Orleans, that was where I headed.  Very simple set up, almost like a cafeteria in which you walk up this line to order your food and pay.  You go to a table of your choice and they bring the food to you as you take a number.  \n\nWhat do I order in the South? Um, a salad? Nope! I go for the fried chicken! Come on! I like the dark meat myself, so that's what I got.  My friend read on the sign that they are known for ham so she ordered that.  We sat down and casually chatted and planned on where we needed to go and what we had to see in NOLA.\n\nThe tables around us included people from other conferences too, tables of 10 or so people all enjoying the food.  No complains really.  So here comes our food and what did I think? The chicken was nice and tasty, good flavor with a good crunch.  I asked for potato salad and macaroni and cheese on the side.  Potato salad, personally I like a little sour kick to it, not really a fan of the sweetness of it that some places opt for.  Here, it was nice and tasty, enough mayonnaise and not sweet.  That was good.  The macaroni and cheese was creamy and the pasta was just right.  My friend enjoyed her ham and also got a side of raspberry jam with her biscuit just because.  That jam is AWESOME! Deliciously sweet and tasty.  A great find.  We were stuffed from dinner that we skipped dessert.\n\nSo we wake up the next morning and opt for breakfast but where? We came back less than 24 hours later for breakfast.  I got a shrimp creole omelet with grits and a biscuit.  I honestly didn't care for it.  It was like they put the shrimp creole ingredients into the omelet after it was cooked.  It just felt like an after thought.  I only tried it because I was in the South and figured I have tried other types of breakfast combinations elsewhere.  And I had grits for the first time.  I'm from the West, so um, just not my thing.  Just a bland pile of grains.  I added a little salt alone, it was OK.  I tried it with butter too and it was OK.  I think I like a little sugar because it gives it a little flavor, but not a breakfast item I can't live without.  My friends and I were so loud that we may have embarrassed a small group of elderly people to the point that they changed tables.  Oh well, I apologize to them, but we were having fun!\n\nSo all in all, I WILL come back for dinner and lunch, but breakfast was just OK to me.  I think if I get breakfast, I will go for the standard items, not a shrimp creole omelet.  Just a standard eggs and bacon and I'm good.  Enjoy! If you come at the odd hours, you have better luck getting in.  We had a late dinner, around 8:30 or so so I was able to avoid the long lines.  Lunch time crowd is packed!

Sure, it's well-known and more of a clich\u00e9 when it comes to diner-style dining in New Orleans.  But, there's a reason that Mother's is on top-- the food is tasty!  \n\nI always stop in Mother's every time I visit New Orleans, and, on this last trip, Vinny and I stopped in twice!  Once for breakfast and once for a late night dinner. On the 1st visit, I had Mae's omelet, which is made with Black Forest Ham. At first, I was caught off guard by the because the omelet had a hint of sweetness, but then I realized that the ham was cooked with a brown sugar caramelized crust (think along the lines of Honey Baked Ham). It was quite good. That morning, Vinny ordered the Crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e omelet, which was a simple egg omelet smothered in the classic creole crawfish concoction. He let me try it, and I must say, it was quite tasty!  Another stand-out of this visit were the biscuits, which we gobbled down smothered in Mother's berry preserves!\n\nOn our 2nd visit, Vinny and I ordered a Roast Beef Po-Boy, Red Beans, and Rice, and Bread Pudding. The Red Beans and Rice were amazing, but the Po-Boy and Bread Pudding were bland to me. I wish we had ordered the Ham Po-Boy instead. I'm sure it would have been tasty with the Black Forest Ham!  \n\nIf you've never been to Mother's, expect to see a line out the door.

The fried chicken takes 25 minutes for it to come out (and they warn you, right there on the menu) but it was delicious and worth the wait! The crust was so light and not as greasy as you'd think (I hate it when you bite into fried chicken, and instead of getting a mouthful of juicy chicken, you get a mouthful of hot oil. SICK). And it was seasoned perfectly. LOVED it.\n\nThe other remarkable thing was that the service was really nice and everyone was super cheerful, and seemed happy to be there (even though they were working on a NOLA holiday and there was a line 300 miles long out the door). I loved that when we pointed out that they accidentally brought us seafood gumbo instead of the shrimp creole that we ordered, there was no attitude, no argument, just a simple \"sorry about that!\" a smile, and they just brought the correct order, no questions asked. It was refreshing.\n\nThe other food we ordered was good enough, but not particularly remarkable.\n\nOverall, the visit was pleasant, although I'm not sure if I'd come back on my next trip out to NOLA though.

Mothers has opened up a warehouse like room next to their main dining hall to accommodate more guests: I felt like I was back in College, eating food prepared on an industrial scale.

This is one of those joints that everyone seems to rave about, but if you walk in expecting a gourmet dining experience, you'll be really disappointed...

I ordered the ham po boy and also drizzled some of their homemade vinaigrette (on all the tables) onto the sandwich.  Perfect harmony of flavor.

I'm an avid yelp reader but this is my very first review-  honestly this place and the experience was SO HORRIBLE I have to warn others to stay the hell away from this hideous tourist trap that INEXPLICABLY has been reeling in out-of-town suckers...\n\nOn my visit to New Orleans, which was overwhelmingly pleasant, awesome, and tasty- this was the ultimate low point [both food and otherwise].  After a night of hard partying and finally scraping ourselves together to venture out for sustenance and more adventures, I recalled a recommendation to hit Mother's for \"the best\" shrimp po' boy.  A short walk away, and we were there, excited, and ready to feast!  \n\nAs soon as we walked in and were completely ignored, them glared/glanced at by the person who was supposed to be seating us/showing us where to order, we should have walked straight out.  Instead we stood awkwardly before finally being acknowledged and told to \"grab menus and get in line\".  At first glance, the menu was overpriced, but we figured it would be worth it [$27 for a shrimp po'boy, a tiny bowl of salad and two lemonades?!].  The troughs behind the counter holding the slop looked DISGUSTING, dirty, old, and crusted over, but I chose to ignore that and approached the counter.  \n\nI work and have worked in the food service industry for a long time, and I understand that people can be annoying sometimes when ordering and it can be hard to hide your annoyance when having a bad day. Sometimes you're just not feeling it, and I GET THAT!   I therefore try to be incredibly succinct and pleasant when I am eating out and ordering.  It didn't matter one tiny bit to the girl taking orders, hands down THE rudest girl I have EVER interacted with in the restaurant business.  Her attitude was decidedly nasty, sarcastic and all around made us feel uncomfortable.  She didn't even bother to pour us our drinks [lemonade] when we ordered, or let us know how our food would be delivered.  She just glared at us and acted like we were responsible for killing her mom or something, just because we were making her DO HER JOB which is RING US UP.   Sorry about that, bitch.  \n\nAfter sitting down and feeling confused about why we were treated so badly at the counter, and wondering where our drinks were, and how we would get our food, they called our number and we went to check and were told to sit down because they would bring it to us.   Here comes the kicker!!!  The po'boy was on dry, stale bread with a paltry amount of bland, rubbery, lukewarm fried shrimp and a haphazard assortment of cabbage drenched in mayo.  The salad literally tasted like dirt, and was gritty, like they hadn]t bothered to wash the vegetables.  After taking one bite of my half of the po'boy, I felt like crying, because I had dragged my girlfriends to this awful place with awful service and awful food.  \n\nTHEN came \"the hair that saved us\".  When biting into her half of the sando, my sister found a long, thick, black hair inside the sandwich.  None of us have long black hair.  It was not our hair!  We were seriously relieved about it, because it meant we could get our money back and get the hell out of that place!!!  Which, of course, was another ordeal in and of itself.  The counter girl actually LAUGHED about it.  I'm sorry, that's not funny, that's disgusting.  When we finally were helped and given a refund, they ONLY refunded the price of the sandwich.  Obviously, it was clear that none of us were going to eat our food [dirt salad and hair po'boy?!  Nooooooo!], so they should have refunded us the full amount.  But, they didn't and we decided it wasn't worth wrangling with the unfriendly and unhelpful staff any longer.  Sooo essentially, we paid around $10 apiece for a lemonade.  Thanks mothers.  Motherf*ckers is more like it.", "date": "2011-07-25 19:14:07"}

First time visitors beware, they are not very patient if you don't know what you want to order nor are they very helpful when you ask for recommendations. Best to view a menu prior to coming or grab one and look while in line. \n\nMother's is a place where the price EXCEEDS the taste. I had the seafood platter which consists of fried shrimp, oysters and catfish. I substituted more shrimp for the oysters (which didn't seem like more @ all) and also had french fries and red beans w/rice as a side. Although none of the food was terrible, the only thing worth mentioning is the shrimp, which tasted like they were seasoned with a standard Old Bay rub. The catfish was bland and a little dry and the red beans didn't have much flavor either, which surprised me considering this is a pretty standard dish in New Orleans. \n\nOverall I paid $25 for this plate (not counting gratuity) when I could have went to Johnny's and got a Po'boy with better shrimp, catfish and fries for $10. If you want to eat at a landmark institution featured on TV, then go for the experience. I have read better reviews of their food, so it may be worth trying a different dish.

What your going to experience is overpriced food and mediocre quality. If you've ever been to the Breakfast club, you are going to experience the same service and subpar food. \nBelieve the low ratings that are being given on this forum.  First this place is in downtown NO. So be ready to pay for parking. Warning!!! If you park across the street in the Preminum parking spot, and you go over your time limit, be ready to fork over 90 dollars to have a boot removed. Don't go to Harrahs thinking you can slide by on the time.\nSecondly. the food is very subpar. My family tried the seafood gumbo, shrimp po boy, roast beef po boy, cabbage, red beans and rice, garden salad, and the bread pudding. The only two good things out of this lineup was the seafood gumbo and the bread pudding. And I'm being extremely generous with the adjective \"good\".  All of this cost over 100 bucks.!!! Be ready to contribute to the rebuilding of NO.  This food was no where near something I would have wanted to take home to savor the next day. \nThe service is what you get. They have signs throughout the building saying tipping is not required. Well guess what. The employees take it to heart and treat you like as though there not going to get a tip. Don't expect your glasses to be refilled when they get empty. You better just raise your hand and hope they come by. Eventually they will get to you.\nThe workers act like your bothering them. This place could pass for \"Dick's\" except Dicks is a fun atmosphere. This place is boring and make you feel very unwanted.  How people get sucked into this restaurant is beyond me, but to each his own. A  friend told me the food is better after a hangover. I can believe that. \nMy advice, find a local restaurant on the outskirts of NO and go there. You will have a better experience and pay half the price.", "date": "2011-08-01 03:33:54"}

Got the Famous Ferdi, a ham and roast beef po-boy with plenty of au jus, cabbage and creole mustard.  Heaven, sheer Heaven.  Dad says the sandwiches used to be much bigger and far more reasonably priced, which he says about everything and isn't wrong.  However, back then you had to wait outside in a sweaty long line and eat standing up at the counter on the wall, so I'll take my experience in the early 2010's over his...good place, old fashioned and worth it.", "date": "2011-08-18 05:14:12"}

I could seriously drink the gravy it is heavenly.\n\nThere is always a line, so get to know your neighbor you will be waiting awhile. They pass menus down so you know what you want when you get in. It does move really fast but do not hem and haw. Know you order and say it as soon as they ask.\n\nPretend to be a helicopter and hoover. You will need to snag a table fast if you want to sit in there and eat. Grab your food, pay and start hoovering.

Well, I suppose that depends on what you get, but I think there's a reason that it has more then 700 reviews now. It's freakin' good! \n\nWent there a few weeks ago and had the Debris Po'Boy ($10), a draft domestic beer (~$3.50), and a large side of Jambalaya (~$6.00). The Debris Po'Boy is da BOMB! I haven't been back to New Orleans since sometime in 2006 (pre-Katrina), but it is just as good as I remember it. \n\nBasically, you order at the counter, they give you a stand-up number (to identify your order), you seat yourself, and they bring it to you shortly thereafter. Regarding service, this is not fine dining, and I get the feeling that New Orleans is known for their somewhat mouthy service and less then the cleanest environments. However, if you've been to the city before, you know that's just part of their charm. So, if you can get over yourself and focus on the food (as you should), then you'll find there are some really great restaurants in the city. So, surly service and all (okay...I was wearing a Falcons shirt and maybe that kind of brought that on), the food is damn good. \n\nThe Debris Po'Boy is served on French Bread (slightly toasted) with the Roast Beef that has fallen off the skewer, is then captured from the juices, and put into a sandwich. I got it dressed, which at Mother's is shredded green cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. Now, the Jambalaya was decent, but I think they put a little too much butter in there so that detracted from the flavor of the Andouille Sausage and spicy chicken and rice. However, it's good to cut the flavor of the Debris Po'Boy with something else. \n\nOh....and we happened to go at a more off-peak time, so we didn't have to wait in a giant line or anything, which was great. So, be strategic about going there. If you roll up on a Saturday at 12 noon...wow...fancy that...there's a line! Come at 2pm, there will be way less people.

Honestly, it didn't do much for me. I prefer my roast beed bloody rare and this was overcooked and like beef jerky. The baked ham and debris elements though were very good. I tried them each separately and liked them. The debris serves as a kind of sauce since it is sitting in the beef juices and it is what really makes the sandwich complete. The bread was also good, but again in New Orleans the bread is great anywhere. You're not going here for ambience or wonderful service, just food. I saw some other dishes while I waited and they looked alright. Kinda upset they did not have sweet tea. How is that possible lol?????\n\nWhile the sandwich disappointed, I have to say their bread pudding was pretty samn amazing. Maybe the best I have had. Simple, but wonderful. Studded with fruit cocktail and what seems to be drenched in maple syrup, this bread pudding was soaked just right leaving in incredibly fluffy but still a nice caramelized texture also. This would serve as a wonderful breakfast and some of the best french toast ever.", "date": "2011-10-03 20:06:27"}

I liked the old feel about it, the casual  no-nonsense vibe, and the simple yet very tasty food[1]. This place is somewhere in between a restaurant, a diner, and a cafeteria.\n\nOrdering food here is somewhat cumbersome:\n- you stay in a line to order the food,\n- you stay in a line to pay,\n- you grab a seat wherever you want and\n- wait until a server comes and gets your receipt and will then bring the food to your table[2].\n\nI tried their Ferdi Special with baked ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy ($10.75). This po-boy is large enough to be shared. This is an excellent po-boy: the ham is tasty and tender, and the roast beef juicy. The debris ( i.e. \"the roast beef that falls into the gravy while baking in the oven\") sounded really yummy but was kind of lost in the po-boy. My only complain is the bread: I think this sandwich could definitely use a bread with a crunchy crust rather than this limp, industrial quality French bread[3].\n\nThe jambalaya ($6.25) was perhaps the best I've had in NOLA: simple, packed with flavor, and yet each ingredient kept its own identity in this dish. Also, the rice was cooked to perfection, with the grains nicely separated.\n\nThe turnip greens side ($3.25) was decent, and the bread pudding ($4.75) surprising: the consistency was very soft, unlike any of the bread puddings I've tried at any of the West Indian places in Brooklyn. I enjoyed it.\n\nMother's is certainly not cheap for such a no-frills place, but it's worth a visit. This place is very popular: come early, and be prepared to long lines.\n----------------------------------\n[1] AND they share their recipes! http://www.mothersrestaurant.net/recipes_dictionary.html\n\n[2] This whole ordeal is somewhat reminiscent of Katz's Delicatessen in New York City: http://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york\n\n[3] This seems to be a constant for po-boys in NOLA, though. On the other hand, aren't po-boys supposed to be really cheap sandwiches for, well, poor boys?", "date": "2011-10-05 00:41:56"}

For 5 days spent in NOLA, this was our one and only bad meal. And it wasn't just bad, it was Godawful. If you're tempted by the promise of Mother's: DON'T BE. \n\nWhen you order  a Debris Po'Boy, dressed, you'd expect to at least get a Po'Boy in some shape or form. We didn't. The way they serve there's no chance to validate the receipt because they take it.\n\nThe food is just plain bad. In our first attempt, the food we did get was a loveless, assembly-line scoop of flavorless goop. My wife's gumbo had all the life of a sausage skin. My red beans and rice were pretty the much the paltry same. \n\nI was here for the Po'Boy. So determined was I that I got back in line and did the same slow crawl back to the front of the counter that you can expect to suffer here. Only I was foolish enough to suffer twice. \n\nWhen I did get my 'dressed' Po'Boy, it was laughable. if by dressed they mean a 3 specks of cabbage then dressed it was but lame is what I got. Another flavorless pile of goop on a soggy bun.\n\nI do appreciate the effort and hard work of the staff busking tables. But the lack of care behind the counter means its all for naught. The owners are obviously content to phone it in and rest on their laurels, but they're dialing the wrong number. \n\nThe atmosphere is divy but interesting. It is clean. As a highlight, you can count on experiencing mild pandemonium while you're here. Unless you're a regular, plan on getting disoriented. That in a way makes the experience entertaining. Once you've ordered and found your seat, you'll have plenty of time to watch the confusion while you wait for the lifeless goop to arrive. \n\n~m", "date": "2011-10-05 23:24:58"}

I went after seeing it on Man vs. Food. During our four day stay we ended up going to Mother's three times! The first day stopped in late and had the seafood platter; fried shrimp, fried oysters, and fried catfish. I had grits, red beans and rice, and turnip greens for sides. All the food was fantastic. The batter is light and crisp, everything is seasoned well but lightly to accommodate tastes.\nThe next day I went for breakfast. I had a ham and mushroom omelet with grits and a biscuit.  The portions are hugs and the food was even better than dinner. Breakfast is definitely the best meal unless you are drunk and need to soak up some alcohol late at night. \nFinally today before heading to the airport I finally stopped for fried chicken. I had the 1/4 white meat with fries and red beans and rice. The chicken was delicious, juicy and seasoned perfectly. Everything was really good.\nThe staff are awesome at Mother's...especially considering they are not allowed to accept tips. To order you have to go through a little test...get your menu, walk to the counter, order, take your seat, put your ticket out and if you pass you get served! They have Abita which goes perfectly with everything. They also mix the sodas there so they are thicker and sweeter. There are always two or more managers that stay out in the dining area keep an eye out. \nIf you are in the CBD while in NOLA I highly recommend going to Mother's. It is a total dive but the food is great. Try to go a little between meal times, it gets very crowded during breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  As for the bad reviews...I think people just had the wrong thing in mind or got overwhelmed by the restaurant. Ignore them and give it a try for yourself.", "date": "2011-11-15 19:34:04"}

Classic new orelans style eatery. I went in due to all the reco's I got. The sign out front says its known for baked ham but they have alot of good stuff in addition to that. Don't be scared by the line out front. The line was about 6 deep outside the door and the server said something about 40 minute wait to get our food which scared some people away. We walked in about 5 minutes and once inside we lined up and was able to place our order in about 5 to 10 minutes. Basically you grab a menu and order at the counter, take your receipt and sit at an empty table. Server will take your receipt, see what you ordered and fetch your food once it comes out. Signs clearly state that servers are not to be tipped (we didn't). Food came out in about 10 minutes. Ordered the Ferdie special since everyone on Yelp seemed to mention it. This place is known in addition to their ham (which to me was tasted like, er ham) for their Debris which is a type of roast beef which resembles moist, shredded beef brisket. The Debris sandwich has this and the au jus like a French Dip. It's pretty damn good. I actually got the Ferdie which is turkey/ham/debris. I also got a cup of gumbo for $6. Sandwiches are large, I can eat a whole but can easily be shared with 2 people if you have a small appetite. So my one knock on this place is the price. $11.75 for the ferdie special (sandwich only, no side) and $6 for gumbo and ~$2 for an iced tea. My friend ordered the sandwich, and etouffee and a side of grits. Our bill came out to $50 (!). I find that to be a lot for a sandwich side and a drink...thank goodness they don't charge tip, but perhaps that's why the prices are so inflated? Also you can get more than just sandwiches. They have pretty much everything here, seafood, platters, fried chicken...", "date": "2011-11-23 23:04:04"}

This place was recommended by the driver of the hotel shuttle, so we knew it had to be good. I also recalled seeing it mentioned on the Food Network somewhere, and that's always a good sign. We later found out that Mother's Restaurant was more than just good, it was LEGENDARY. I mean, it's been up and running since 1938 and hasn't changed much since then. Places that stay open for that long are definitely doing something right.\n\nWhen we walked in, I immediately noticed the \"old school\" vibe the place had. I could also tell it was diner/cafeteria style dining, which I didn't mind as long as the food was good. The walls were absolutely COVERED with framed photos of people who were important visitors to the restaurant in some way, whether they were famous, local heroes, or just loyal, longtime patrons. It gave the restaurant that \"family-owned-and-run\" feel for sure.\n\nMy husband and I decided once again to split an entree because they came with lots of side items. It took a while to decide, as usual, but we finally agreed on the Seafood Platter: oysters, shrimp, and catfish (all fried) plus red beans & rice, grits, jamalaya, and shrimp etouffee--a complete cornucopia of classic cajun cuisine! And WOW was it a lot of food! Even between two people we couldn't finish it all. And as you can see in the photo, the server was cool with us splitting--even gave us an extra plate and everything. \n\nNow, most of these foods I've had before in one form or another, except for the fried oysters or shrimp etouffee. Both were awesome. What I liked about the fried seafood was that the breading was light and crispy, not greasy. The jambalaya was nice and flavorful, definitely good. The grits were a bit bland though, needed cheese maybe. And the rice and beans could've used more rice and less sauce to my taste. BUT Overall the meal was wonderful and would certainly recommend Mother's Restaurant to anyone who's in New Orleans and is looking for some honest-to-goodness cajun food with great prices and a no-frills atmosphere.\n\n\nBottom Line: Come hungry, and don't expect classy surroundings...this is REAL Cajun food!\n\nPlease visit my blog site to see this review, more photos, and other reviews....\n\nhttp://roscoenala.webs.com/apps/blog/show/10683481-restaurant-review-mother-s-restaurant", "date": "2011-12-02 17:18:15"}

It has a small bit of spice to it and with some extra Tabasco thrown on everything goes perfectly together.\n\nOther reviewers are right, the place is a bit overpriced.

I definitely wasn't expecting the format and ended up feeling rushed because there was a VERY long line of customers behind us waiting to order.  The woman who took our order at the register was pretty disconnected, blank stare and no smiles as my family franticly tried to decide on what to order.  Then disconnection turned to an expression that screamed \"will you hurry the hell up and order\".\n \nSo we rushed through annoyed, left wondering if we made the best choices, and shocked by the bill. This place is really expensive in my opinion, for what we actually got in terms of service, food quality and ambiance.  Anyway, we got a table in the back by the kitchen (never a good thing) because it was so packed, then food came out, quickly, but that is to be expected as all they had to do is scoop it out of the warming pans at the counter.\n   \nSo, a couple of the kids got the Famous Ferdi Special and they both loved it.  I sampled the gumbo, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with ham chunks and they were all A-OK, none of those dishes made me hum and close my eyes in enjoyment, so I was disappointed. I guess my expectations were high based on the reviews and recommendations.  I was most disappointed by the fried oysters, which unlike another reviewer's experience, mine were very small and mushy, and I couldn't really tell that they were fried.\n  \nOn the bright side, the best thing I had was the bread pudding which honestly, based on the presentation; I was not rushing to try it.  It sat in the bowl looking like a mushy unrecognizable mess (so sorry to say that but it did) but OH it was YumOLicious!\n \nSo, I would definitely run in for a bowl of that delicious mushy bread pudding the next time I am in NOLA  but that's about it for me, OR maybe I would give them another try just because it HAD to be an off night, based on the fact that so many LOVE this place.", "date": "2012-01-23 02:57:55"}

I would never attempt to eat here on weekends!!!", "date": "2012-02-10 22:21:25"}

It's a cute, homely place, with a mostly pleasant wait staff, and was actually the first taste I ever got of the city (yes, I'm one of the few who came here sober). The problem really is that their signature items just aren't really that impressive, at least not as much as they were when they first became famous for them, so you build this ideal up that will inevitably be shattered.\n\nThat was certainly the case for me with their famous \"Ralph\" sandwich, consisting of baked ham, roast beef, gravy, cheese, and something they call \"debris\", which is essentially the juicy run-off that you get from the roast beef as it's cooking. In theory this should be an overly indulgent and somewhat hedonistic pleasure-pile of meats with enough wetness to make it go down super easy. It falls short on the meat, and comes up extra on the soggy, to just leave you feeling a little limp.\n\nThe real problem is that the main components of this legendary sandwich are just all a bit bland in their own individual roles, so combining them together doesn't really bring out the desired effect. I mean, just look at the bread and cheese (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/3582970601/) ...it doesn't get much more basic than that in the culinary world. The ham (which has become famous in its own right) was the one saving grace, providing a pack of a punch that I wish the roast beef had followed up with. But the biggest disappointment was this debris that is so hailed as the secret ingredient that makes the whole thing worth ordering. It just added very little whatsoever, other than dampening the bread, which I suppose was a good thing since it was so plain.\n\nIt's a good, filling meal, and if you time it right you won't have to suffer through the touristically torturous long lines. The price is pretty fair for what you get, by New Orleans standards, so if you really must check this one off your list at least it isn't too much of an inconvenience. Perhaps the real gem is in the other parts of the menu, waiting to be discovered, but this time around the hype just wasn't backed up.", "date": "2012-02-22 18:28:23"}

The food was average, and I went with a group so had a fair sampling of most everything, and the gumbo was super not awesome.\n\nBased on that lone, I'd give it 3 stars, but what really put me off of this place was the atmosphere. The staff members were all uniformly rude; they barked at people, told them to \"hurry up\" when ordering, and not a single person out of four people responded to me when I said hello or thank you or asked a question. I'm from Tennessee and was put off that they advertise themselves as super Southern or home-y, given not only the clear lack of hospitality but the weird sense of hostility on top of that. Minus 1 star.\n\nMinus the next star: The staff in here, while not all of them, cursed quite a bit. I'm talking your Bs, your Fs, and then the ultimate: the N-word!

Good lord!!\n\nAfter I went there and swore never to return, I passed it the next evening while walking south on Poydras. A manager-looking person had taken a female employee outside, seemingly to hear her version of some sort of fight that took place. They were both standing on the entrance ramp to the restaurant and not moving out of the way for potential customers, essentially barricading the place. The female employee was going on about how she doesn't F'ing lie, and the manager was just nodding in this weird sort of sympathy. Behind them, a third employee also on the ramp just smoked. Two customers came out to leave and actually had to wait for these people to scram.\n\nHaving said all that, if you want REALLY awesome food, go to P&G, the place on Baronne between Perdido and Union just a little bit north of Mother's that looks like a hospital cafeteria.

After watching Adam Richman from Man vs. Food pay a visit and eat a juicy Po-Boy - I just had to try it! YES - there is ALWAYS a line and its always LONG. But suck it up - because it goes pretty fast. I'd say we had at least 30 people in front of us and we were in within 15 min. Why? The restaurant inside is HUGE (self-seating) and the line to order your food inside is basically the only bottle neck.\n\n--Famous Fredi's Special ($11.75)--\nMUST TRY! This is what Mother's is known for! This sandwich is basically a huge pile of meat all placed between a french roll (which is also dipped in meat juice)! SO hearty and satisfying! What kinds of meat you ask? A variety: black ham, thick slices of roast beef, and of course the DEBRIS! When they described it on Man vs. Food - I was a little disturbed. The bits and pieces of left over meat - how can that be good? IT IS! TRUST! Its like a juicier version of pulled pork - soft and slow cooked! Make sure you get a stack of napkins - because this sandwich can get MESSY. With the meat juice, shredded cabbage, globs of mayo + mustard, gravy, and of course the layers of meat, you will have to wipe with each bite. All the meat went really well with the tangy and yet creamy sauces - I went to carnivore heaven!\n\n--Jerry's Omelete ($11)--\nAfter feeling a little sickly from all the heavy meals in NOLA - I ordered an egg white omelete in hopes of giving my poor stomach a break. The omelete was filled with bell pepper, turkey, red onions, and mushrooms. This was the blandest plate of food ever! I had to salt + pepper with each bite! Not only that, the topping to egg proportion was too little and the entire plate was covered in grease! I did enjoy the taste of grits - which I'm not used to! Felt like home in my belly! :) I also got to try Mother's famous jam with my toast.. but all in all, this is a dish to avoid.\n\n--Combination Platter ($19)--\nYes we're tourists and we want to taste everything. So what better way than to order the combo platter which comes with Jerry's Jambalaya, etouffee, red beans, vegetables, and potato salad!? This plate is a blessing because you do get to try so many dishes - but after tasting these same dishes elsewhere in NOLA, I can tell you this combination platter may not be worth it. A lot of the food @ Mother's just tasted really mushy, goopy, and a little bland. The etouffee was one shining star on the dish - which was very flavorful. I think one downfall of this dish is that all these dishes are plopped onto the same tiny plate and the flavors get lost in the mix!\n\n--Mae's Gumbo Cup ($6)--\nA small little cup of gumbo - which tasted homey and less salty than other places. But I honestly had a hard time differentiating the different gumbos at the variety of NOLA restaurants. Meh - nothing special.\n\nTips\n1) Self seating area is much bigger in Mother's next door\n2) Soft drink ($2.25) - unlimited refills\n3) FREDI'S SPECIAL!", "date": "2012-03-23 22:25:43"}

For one person, it is a very huge sandwich. I liked the roast beef better than the ham, it was all very flavorful and moist, but I didn't like how the bottom part of the bread was so soggy.

Mother's is closed on Mother's Day.  Rats...  We go back the next day and there is quite a wait.  Typically, I always bet on breakfast if it is available all day long.  But, on this trip, I decided that typical just was not my style...  I went off of the grid and fell on my face, but time.  I noticed someone stirring a pot of gravy and decided that I would try the roast beef since the debris looked so interesting.  There was a combo that was specifically called Red Beans & Rice that came with a meat and two sides.  I'll try it out...  No, you do not have to pick the beans & rice as one of your sides, it comes with it automatically (which you should, they taste so horrible, they SHOULD give that mess away).

There were turnip greens that I had that could have used some of the flavor from the cabbage, but they must have forgotten.  No, lets get to this roast beef.  Sigh...  First, I will start with the debris.  They gave me a side of gravy that had chunks of roast beef in a bowl.  I really expected the gravy to be on top of the roast beef, nah.  It was flavorless and I really do not know what to do with a cup of gravy, especially with no bread.  Now, this roast beef.  Lets think about when we go to the deli counter at the grocery store.  You know how you can request it to be sliced for you?  Well, we are not going for top shelf roast beef, we are not going for Boars Head quality.  No... we are going for the brand that is 2 notches below the managers store-brand special.  They gave me COLD roast beef on a plate!  WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT???  WHY would you do that?  WHO appreciates this mess?\nHubs ordered the Ferdi Poboy and after realizing that he had been duped, came to realize that he hated it.  He had the jamabalaya that was at least tolerable.

Don't get me wrong it was good, but it wasn't fully hot and I counted a total of 4 miniature shrimp in my bowl. Now the red beans and rice on the other hand made me think of my own mother's recipe and they get 5 stars! I topped this meal off with the bread pudding, and my mouth thanked me...it was delicious...inside I noticed there were grapes, pineapples and other fruit baked inside the bread.\n\nA few days later I was in search of a delicious shrimp po boy and was told by my hotel concierge to give Mothers another try, so I did and it was AMAZING. The shrimp were super fresh, fried to perfection and rested upon a stack of pickles and coleslaw. I wanted to go back for another but in fear of being judged I decided not to, lol. \n\nOverall I like this place but wasn't 100% satisfied with my gumbo experience, I totally recommend the po' boys and red beans and rice..yummmerrrs.", "date": "2012-05-24 22:01:21"}

The building is old so is the inside. This is probably the divest, most casual place I have ever eaten but it definitely brings some character and history. After a long line outside and inside the place, it was time to order. So apparently they are famous for their ham/roast beef sandwich but I would kill myself to go to New Orleans for a turkey'like sub. I then ended with the true cajun experience with a shrimp po'boy, jambalaya, etouffe and gumbo. All items were really good, coming from fresh produce and made in front of you (I am not joking, you walk in front of the kitchen lol). While the po'boy hits the spot, it was fairly basic which I was expecting some secret seasoning or magic cajun remoulade to go with it. The trio bowl as I will call it was definitely a major highlight. Every restaurant in Nola will claim to have the best jambayala or gumbo or etouffe but Mother's is truly good at it. I do mean truly which means that it is probably how people have done it since the old days or like your grand'ma used to make it. Next time, I will just go with those 3 with a personal preference for the etouffe...\n\nIf you are looking for a great, cheap and true new orleans (cajun) food experience, this is IT!\n\nTip: after you order, you can go grab a table (you won't be allow before) and make sure you give your ticket to one of the waiter/busser else no one is going to prepare your food and serve you...", "date": "2012-05-30 02:27:02"}

The Jambalaya was out of this world and to date I have not found anything other jambalaya like it.  The dish was flavorful and when I added Mother's special hot sauce (it looked to be their own creation as the bottle had no label on it), it added a light kick to it that ramped up the flavor.

I happened to see a picture my friend took and posted on her facebook of a line at this restaurant.  I asked about it and she said she stood in it and was worth the wait so I had to give it a shot.\nMy husband and I got there about 11:45AM.  We waited in line outside until it started to rain and the restaurant was nice enough to have people move the line inside and wait.  We thought wheew, can't be that bad but as soon as we got in, the line was still longer than we thought and went along side the entire dining area.  That's OK, gave me a chance to look at other peoples food.  Lord but it confused me even more because it ALL looked so good.  I was so excited and knew everything I was about to eat, no matter what it was I picked was going to be good. Once you get to the beginning of the line you dont get seated, you tell the lady what your ordering keep moving in line and order you drink than find a open seat, which as busy as it was that wasn't a problem.   I decided to go with lunch instead of breakfast food and got the crawfish ettouffee, red beans and rice, grits and a biscuit.  The Ettoufee was fabulous, I wish it were bottomless.  I wanted more.  The red beans and rice, what can I say but YUMMMMMMM  I love a good red beand & rice.  I hate it when I go somewhere that says they have it than order it and it's not the real red beans & rice, but this....this oh yes it is!!!  I can appreciate it that.  The grits werent special, seemed the same to me.  I would rather double up on the beans, lol.  And the biscuits were just fantastic fabulous!!!  Homemade and mouth watering!  My husband couldnt keep his paws off mine!  So my review, I was very please with it all and would absolutely go back there and and recommend someone to visit before leaving New Orleans.  It must be a staple restaurant of Nawlins.  Now, my hubby ordered a Po Boy, I am not so crazy about sandwiches filled with me, I did take a bite and w/o the mayo it would have been better for me but it was good.  I dont regret not ordering one though, thats all on my hubby and he LOVED it.  \nOh afterwards I saw that this was a spot Man vs Food visited.  Gots to be good if on TV.  I hope you go and I know you will enjoy.  :)", "date": "2012-08-01 18:13:57"}

The first night I was in New Orleans, I visited Mother's.\n\nI tried the Debris with pork sandwich at Mothers. It was good. Was it as amazing as I had heard.... well no. I liken Mother's to Phillipe's French Dip sandwich in LA. It's a place you need to visit when you are in the city, but in terms of a fantastic meal that is beyond anything you have ever tasted, it certainly falls short. Perhaps I lack the sophisticated taste buds of so many fans of Mother's, but the flavors did not seem complicated or exceptional in any way. My memory of the sandwich was that of a fairly salty sandwich with a good amount of meat. Nothing really interesting. I actually did not eat my entire sandwich due to the saltiness of the meat. I gave the large remainder to my colleague to finish. I have had much better sandwiches than this in places that are much more obscure. To say the least I was disappointed.\nFood: 2/5\n\nIf it were not for the fact that it is a fairly famous place in NOLA, I would say Mother's is kind of a boring restaurant. The restaurant has brick walls and a cafeteria style counter. The walls have pictures of people and places and reminded me of an Applebee's. Maybe Mother's was different before it became a tourist destination, but it really has no character in my opinion. It looks like a tourist trap. All that's missing is a giftshop counter.... oh wait there is one..... With all criticism aside, the restaurant is clean and the management has worked to make it family friendly and amiable.\nAtmosphere: 3/5\n\nFor myself, Mother's was an acceptable value. It was a big sandwich, and I couldn't even finish it. The price was not wallet busting, but it wasn't an everyday meal either. Personally, I think you can get better value at other places, but Mother's is acceptable and hence average.\nValue: 3/5\n\nI had no problem nor exceptions to the service. The servers themselves did not seem too happy, but then again it was fairly late -- and I'm sure they have to deal with plenty of drunk idiots late at night. Aside from that Mother's is a fairly self serve/pay-at-the-counter sort of place. So service may not even be applicable.\nService: N/A\n\nOverall I was not impressed by Mother's. I'm not a connoisseur of finer Louisiana cuisine, so I don't have the taste buds to distinguish the difference between layers of salt. In my opinion, I think excessive salt use is a sign of poor quality and lazy flavoring, but many true Americans would disagree. I am sure in future visits to NOLA I will be returning to Mother's when other people I am traveling with demand it. I will, however, not expect much because I now know it is almost all hype mixed with a heaping bowl of salt.", "date": "2012-08-02 02:38:51"}

This Po' Boy was LOADED with baked ham, roast beef, debris, gravy, shredded cabbage, pickles, mayo and mustard.  My theory is if a menu item includes the word Famous, you should give it a shot.  One thing you should know about me is even though I'll try anything once, I am certainly not a fan of ham, mayo, or getting my hands dirty while eating.  But when in New Orleans, right?!   \n\nThis was possibly the BEST meal I had all weekend. This sandwich was juicy, messy, packed full of flavor, and loaded with enough meat to feed two people.  Being from a New Orleans family, I know that the messier the Po' Boy the better. And this sandwich did not disappoint.  It was so good, I ate the tiny bits that fell onto the table.  \n\nThe staff was super friendly, and I had them laughing with me before I left.  One waiter overheard me say  \"I don't even like ham, but this SH*T is so good!\".  He couldn't help but laugh and give my table a smile. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone looking for a taste of the local cuisine.

Now, I got an earful for picking Mother's because this was supposed to be expensed, and I picked such a dive. But seriously, the rest of our party was pretty lit before we came. If I recall correctly, we all had at least 3 pints of beer and 4 shots of Jager, and already acting goofy (my tolerance is a bit higher than these guys). Plus everyone's in shorts and t-shirt, I'm not going to get a reservation at some upscale restaurant! \n\nIn any case, when I visit a new place, I go to Yelp and find the most reviewed restaurant and try to go there. Since one in our party gets nauseous at the sight of Oysters, we couldn't go to Acme Oyster House (#1 in NOLA), so I settled for #2, and here we are.\n\nFERDI SPECIAL & MOTHER'S BEST BAKED HAM\nSo everyone goes nuts over this Ferdi thing I guess. It's their OMG Universe Famous Baked Ham, roast beef, debris (basically roast beef that cooked in its own gravy), gravy, and some mustard, shredded cabbage, etc. Anything with the name \"Famous\" in it means I gotta try it! \n\nThis Po Boy is monstrous, by the way, Put together, it's probably like a 14 inch sandwich, and it's tall too! So I take this first bite, waiting for the Creole seasoning to make my mouth water, the mustard to heighten my senses, and the oh-so-famous ham to provide even more seasoning and end it with a nice sweet flavor that only baked hams can bring, but......... I waited, and waited. Hm, must be a dud. Took another bite....and waited. Something was wrong here!\n\nNormally I blame bread, because bread tends to suck out flavor and inject its own boringness into it, so I removed the bread and tried the oh-so-famous ham by itself. The texture was there, but both the seasoning and flavor were not! Where did they go?! I tried the slice of roast beef, and it too was seasonless and almost flavorless! The mayo and mustards were evident, but even their flavors were getting sort of overwhelmed by the Nothing (Neverending Story anyone?). Seriously, all the meats and the bread were basically acting as flavor suckers, and it really tasted like a water flavored sandwich! \n\nEventually, I had to use some Crystal hot sauce just to get anything out of it. Blah, what a waste! THIS is what everyone craves? I don't get it!\n\nSEAFOOD GUMBO\nNow, this was good. The crawfish in it definitely came out (tastes like shrimp). It was a little watery in texture, but the flavors were nice and spicy. The crawfish didn't taste fishy (like my gumbo from the night before), but had a very good shrimpy flavor to it. Seasoning was just ok, it could've been seasoned a little more in my opinion. Solid, though. Believe it or not, I'd still take Heaven on Seven (in Chicago) over this. Maybe it's the fact that Heaven is the traditional chicken/Andouille sausage that adds its own seasoning instead of just crawfish. \n\nCRAWFISH ETOUFFEE\nSo, in my mind, this and gumbo seem very similar. I'm sure all of NOLA is about to kick my ass now, but seriously, I think they're similar. They have differences in taste, such as the gumbo being ever so slightly more tangy, maybe because of the tomato base, and etouffee being more...seafoody? I don't know. It had the same great shrimpy flavor as the gumbo, but it was a little thicker and a little spicier, which I liked. Also like the gumbo, I wish it was seasoned a little more. I added some Crystal hot sauce to this, and it gave me my seasoning, but the additional flavors were unwelcome. \n\nANDOUILLE SAUSAGE\nGot a separate order of some of these, and I was kind of disappointed. The flavors weren't as strong as I would have expected, considering that the Andouille in other dishes I've had was very pronounced. Here it was kind of dull. The texture was also interesting. It felt like it wasn't quite packed as tightly as, say, a polish sausage or even a brat. I was really hoping for more spice and seasoning, but it was lacking. It didn't even really have a pungent flavor either. It seemed very conservative and timid, which was completely unlike our party, since us drunk fools all had a couple more beers at Mothers! LOL!\n\nMOTHER PLEASE!\nI am very disappointed in the #2 most famous joint in NOLA. The bartender at our hotel even told us that Mother's is sort of an overpriced letdown. I couldn't agree more. I mean, I'd do anything to have ready access to Mother's gumbo and etouffee at home (Heaven on Seven is not the easiest place to get to, so as much as I love it, I've only been twice), but I wouldn't make a trip out here to try Mother's food.

We scouted out the dining area and saw people eating fried chicken; we knew we had to bring our father back for this chicken. That Saturday we arrived for lunch and unbeknownst to us, Saturday's special is fried chicken. It was the tastiest, moistest, tender chicken I have ever had. On our table we had a combination of sides: red beans and rice, turnip greens, French fries (eye-roll), biscuit, and dirty rice. All of the sides were absolutely delicious.

To begin with, there is Validated parking.  I only discovered this after we circled the place for about 20 minutes.  THEN you get inside...I'm not sure if it's because I was a fan of Seinfeld but it had a very NICE Soup Nazi feel.  And I mean this in a very good and loving way.  We were new here, first timers.  It only took a minute or two to figure it out.  You walk in, grab a menu, get in line, DO NOT BLOCK the entrance to the servers location or you could get food all over you.  (there is a BIG SIGN to tell you this!)  As you cross that gap you're in the home stretch.  A couple minutes later you belt out your order and are given your receipts.  You then find a place to sit (with your drinks-Coffee there was AMAZING).  Then the fun begins.  We chose a seat by the gap.  Watching all the other first timers walk in was fun.  Since we had been there 5 minutes by this point we were TOTAL MOTHERS EXPERTS.  Watching someone block the gap was incredibly funny!  FIRST TIMERS-HA!  See, the thing about places like this is the structure, the code, the military precision with which they perform a chaotic task.  OK enough about the show...the food.  Simply put...it was amazing.  We had eggs and biscuits and the coffee.  We also ordered 3 orders of BREAD PUDDING to bring back with us.  My older but less handsome brother fashions himself quite the bread pudding expert and he (with a full mouth) gave it a two thumbs up.  If you ever have the chance GO HERE and see what living and food are all about!  They have a sign that tells you that staff cannot except tips.

You place your order and then they make your sandwich and you walk down to the end to pay and get your beverage.  Then you find yourself a seat and they bring you your food.

We also had the mothers special sandwich which was good as well.  In total the cost was about $30 for those two dishes.", "date": "2012-10-28 21:17:52"}

Yes, it's a must to visit, but more for overall experience, and less for the world famous Ferdi Special.  It's an all meat Po Boy with Mother's famous ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy.

My first stop on the NOLA tour was Mother's Restaurant, and I will admit both joy and disappointment.\n\nAs a disciple of Adam Richman, I had to go to Mother's.  Following his path can be a joy and a burden.  The main sandwich highlighted during Man v. Food was the Ferdi:  root beer glazed ham and debris (tiny shred of beef) with all the fixings.  This sandwich looked amazing on television, but deep down inside I knew I wouldn't freak out about this po boy.\n\nMy companions both chose different sandwiches.  Our NOLA friend got a po boy of just debris, and the misses got the fried shrimp po boy.  As soon as the sandwiches arrived, I was immediately pulling shrimp from her po boy.  We ultimately decided to share our sandwiches three ways.  \n\nThe debris itself was pretty delicious, but it felt like something that I could have easily done on my own. However, perhaps that's the point of Mother's.  The shrimp was soooooo great!  I could have ate three of those by myself.\n\nAnd now the Ferdi.  I thought the Ferdi was okay.  Separately, each component would work as its own sandwich, but the parts together didn't ring my bell.  The debris has a nice flavor, but it really overshadowed the ham, which is supposed to be famous.  I would have like to try the ham by itself.\n\nAs for the prices, Mother's takes advantage of its notoriety.  The Ferdi was $11.75, and he shrimp po boy was $14.00.  I can justify a pricey bit of seafood, but twelve dollars for some beef and ham, that's a little outrageous.  Being located in the Central Business District doesn't help, too.  I spent forty dollars on three sandwiches, no drinks or sides.  That was the biggest disappointment.\n\nI learned my lesson, NOLA.  More about my journeys later . . .", "date": "2013-01-03 22:59:36"}

Flavorwise, the sandwich was good, but it tasted flat. There were no dynamics to it, no dancing of heat or depth that I was expecting of a sandwich of such purported caliber. Also, there was too much jus that came along with the sandwich, rendering the bread really soggy. I'm all for a wet sandwich, but this was too much. Also, the meats were a bit cold, which I was not expecting. Maybe that's the style, but it would be miles better if they used hot meats.

When my girlfriend at the time and i stumbled onto this establishment while walking just a few blocks away from our hotel, the line out the door told me this place was something special. I am glad i stopped. I ended up going here daily about 6 times in my one week trip. The jambalya, crawfish etoufee, grits, grits with debris, gumbo. Every single thing i had was among the best food i had ever tasted. It feels like you are in a southern grandmas house eating homestyle cooking every time. The staff is organized and though it looks crazy, they have a system and it works. The line moves quickly but you will need the time to decide what you want. Every time i went there seating was limited, but honestly even with the great atmosphere, nothing matters but the food. This is what this place is all about: THE FOOD. I have committed to go back to NOLA if for no other reason than to eat at mothers again. Its that good. No matter what you get, no matter where you eat it, one thing will be certain when you leave mothers. You have just eaten one of the best meals of your life. Dont take this place for granted and dont worry about trying other places. If you go here every day and try a different item each day, you will still have sampled the best NOLA cuisine has to offer. I hated going anywhere else because after eating here, nothing can hold a candle to the standard set by Mothers.... these are the places yelp is all about, and its sad to see only barely above 3 stars for what i consider one of the two best restaurants i have ever eaten at.

They had a gentleman at the front door letting folks in in bunches to keep the line inside just full enough to keep things moving. \n\nThe service is efficient and our waiter was attentive enough (brought our food quickly and refilled our water several times).  \n\nWe had the Ralph Special (i.e. Famous Ferdi Special with cheese, because cheese makes just about EVERYTHING better).  It was very tasty and there was plenty of it, but there was actually a little less meat than I expected (esp. given how Adam Richman GUSHED over the size of it on Man v. Food).   The best part was DEFINITELY the debris (so much so, that my husband headed back the next day for a Debris Po Boy).\n\nWe also had the smoked sausage po-boy since they were out of hot sausage :(   It was very good and I kicked it toward hot some of their pepper sauce.  This one actually had MORE meat than I expected.  So I guess between the two, it all balanced out.  :D\n\nWe finished up with their bread pudding which includes fruit cocktail as a bit of a twist.  I thought it was very good, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had (I am a fan of bread pudding and make a pretty good one at home if I do say so myself, so I'm kinda picky in this area).  However, the buttery sauce was worth the price of the dish.

We waited maybe 5 minutes before ordering at the cash. I ordered the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e and the seafood gumbo. Our party also had the fergi sandwich, the jambalaya and the shrimp creole. \n\nThe crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e was amazing. Get it if you come here. It's flavour is perfect and its served on a bed of rice. Such a nice change to have crawfish that isn't frozen to kingdom come. \n\nThe gumbo was alright, personally I think I make a better gumbo. They had oysters in it which was kind of different, but otherwise there wasn't anything super special about it. It too is served with rice. \n\nThe jambalaya had an overwhelming taste of crystal hot sauce. It kind of took away from the rest of the flavours. It's a shame because I think if they used cayenne instead it would have been a pretty good jambalaya. \n\nI didn't really like the fergi sandwich. Personally I found it dry and not tender. Then again, I've had my share of melt in your mouth Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, so this was like watching high school football instead of the NFL. \n\nThe shrimp creole was pretty much tomato sauce with shrimp in it. I'm not sure if creole is supposed to be like that, but it seemed like I opened a can of pasta sauce. \n\nAnyways, I'd definitely want to come back here and try some of the other things.

The restaurant is pretty easy to find - look for the long lines at all hours of the day.  The line moves fairly quickly, as the restaurant is huge.\n\nOnce you step inside, you'll need to step into another line to place your order.  You'll be able to see the food being prepped and review the specials of the day.  Know what you want, because that line also moves fairly quickly and there is no time for anyone to hem and haw.  There are a lot of people they need to serve!\n\nWe were there a few minutes before 11 am and were told we could not order off the regular menu as breakfast was still being served.  We decided to step back to let a few parties move in front of us but even that did not allow us enough time.  An employee noticed our dilemma and ushered us to the front of the line and told the cashiers to let us order from the lunch menu.  Others were having the same issue as us and it was creating problems.   Many thanks to that kind gentleman.\n\nI ordered the shrimp and oyster po'boy with a side of dirty rice.  Be warned, their sandwiches are HUGE and can easily be shared.  The seafood was lightly battered and seasoned.  It was not the slightest bit greasy.  The sandwich came with mayo and some shredded cabbage on a soft, thick sandwich roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mothers-restaurant-new-orleans?select=CqOy-1uLjwIG5L1McsSR2Q#CqOy-1uLjwIG5L1McsSR2Q).  A few dashes of hot sauce and squirts of lemon juice completed the sandwich for me.  Overall I the sandwich was okay.  Nothing out of this world, but it was just as I had expected and it was good.  The only bad side, if this can be a bad thing, was that there was just so much food!  I ended up eating only one half of the sandwich and then picking out the seafood from the other half.\n\nAs for the dirty rice, I quite enjoyed it.  I shared this cup of rice with my friends and we all thought it was good.  The rice was cooked well, and the bits of meat-to-rice ratio was good.  Seasoning was spot on.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mothers-restaurant-new-orleans?select=9qtVZCaYNV0ucwis2HwaFw#WFc4lbeegnG_0zktkmKYeg\n\nOne friend ordered the Famous Ferdi Special, which comes with ham, roast beef, debris and gravy and loved it.  I tried some of it and thought it was delicious.  It could have easily fed three of four people!  \n\nAnother friend ordered the omelette and noticed that the eggs were prepared ahead of time and filled to order.  From my sample taste I found it to be okay, but nothing I would go out of my way to order at Mother's.  Stick with what they are famous for, I say.\n\nAs for the service, I found the staff to be direct and efficient, but my friends found them to be bordering on rude.  Quite frankly the service was similar to what I've seen in many other super busy/packed restaurants.  The staff have a lot of tables to take care of and lots of requests to meet.  They do the best they can and don't have time for customers that don't know what they want.  Rude?  Not to me.  Actually I found the attitude a bit comical.", "date": "2013-03-22 04:16:27"}

The tired, tanned, and soon-to-be sick version of me was ready for reintroduction to real food (sorry, Carnival), and I couldn't imagine a better place to do just that than Cochon, a restaurant with a reputation for inventive, southern cuisine, and one of Bon Appetit's '20 Most Important Restaurants in America'. Well, they were closed. So, we tried Root, a hip new restaurant receiving a lot of press in the port area recommended of fellow food blogger, Megan (I Run For Wine). Also closed... Damn. How about Stanley's extremely popular brunch? Well, my fellow patrons weren't exactly interested in a one-mile walk in the rain.... it was time to consult a concierge. She recommended Mother's Restaurant, just a few blocks away. In hindsight, while we may have missed some opportunities to dine at a few amazing establishments, we did not go wanting for some delicious, home-style NOLA breakfast.\n\nMy cousin-in-law (one day, fingers-crossed, hint hint, wink wink, GIVE ME A DAMN RING--I'm only kidding, kind of), Jonathan, and his wife, Heather, joined me in this deceivingly large restaurant, tucked inside an unassuming brick building. The line to order had already formed, so we took our place and perused the menu. After ordering our breakfast spoils, we navigated a variety of rooms, already filled with hungry breakfast crowds, and found a table in the large, open air bar room (and yes, your breakfast can come fully-equipped with a mimosa, bloody mary, or beer). We decided to skip alcohol, at least until we made it to the airport, where there really isn't anything better to do.\n\nAfter the quick exchange of smiles and receipts with a waitress, our food was brought to us as it was ready. Mine was the first to come, and despite attempting to show my southern manners, I dug in after a little encouragement from Jonathan. Say hello to the crawfish etouffee omelet: a fluffy omelet, filled and covered with crawfish etouffee, a Louisiana classic filled with green onions, garlic, sweet onions, celery, Cajun spices, and creamy goodness; mixed with the grits alone, it was amazing. Only a side of fluffy biscuits, grape jam, and an extremely generous amount of butter could improve this situation. It was delicious, and it only put me back $14.

All I can base the review on is what it is now. It's a sandwich shop with a really long line most of the time. We stopped by on a Sunday at 5:30, there was very little traffic, and we got the Ferdi which is the signature sandwich, apparently. \n\nThey are slow. I'm going to say that up front. If you're in a hurry, I'm sure this will annoy you. If you're on vacation, then there's probably no rush. They take their time either way.\n\nWe got 1 sandwich and split it. We got it to go and took it over to the little Roman fountain and sat in the sun and ate it. They put the stewed meat on the side so it wouldn't make a mess of the bread & the bag, which was nice. We slapped it all together and almost made a total mess of ourselves but managed not to dump and of the juice on us. \n\nIt was very good. It wasn't great, it wasn't awful. It wasn't overrated or underrated. It was good. I'm glad I didn't wait 30 minutes in line for this, so I would say to go on off hours and enjoy it then. In reading other people's reviews I wish I had gotten the bread pudding but at this stage I may explode if I keep eating 4-5 meals a day down here. The sandwich itself was tasty, the pickle-based slaw was a good contrast to the meat. The juice of the meat made the sandwich. Without that, it would be ordinary at best. The meat was good, but not seasoned particularly well or anything. \n\nI have to think that if there's a long line, it may not be worth the wait. They also do a turtle soup apparently but it was out the day we went. There are surely worse places to go and the guy at Newark airport even said he wished he could go there again. So for that, I'm glad we went to experience what it was like. Worth the trip but probably not worth the wait.", "date": "2013-05-06 17:55:28"}

I personally have always found it to be one of the most over-rated restaurants in the city. The food is just average. The seating system is terrible: Customers have to stand outside in a long line until they are allowed inside to stand in yet another line to order. All the while only about half the tables are occupied. Since you take your own order, seat yourself, and pay right after you order, there is no waitstaff, only busboys, who may or may not fill drinks, etc. The bathrooms are always extremely dirty. The list goes on. Why anyone would choose this place over the hundreds of wonderful restaurants in NOLA is a mystery to me. But I've always been amenable to taking my guests anyway, because the place is famous for some reason.\n\nNo more. My family wanted to eat at Mother's while they were here for Memorial Day weekend this year, so we went. The food was no better than usual. Some of my family members liked theirs; mine was so so; my mother didn't even finish her po-boy because the bread was too soggy to eat. \n\nThen as we were finishing dinner, the busboy came up to my sister, who had paid the bill, and told her the NO TIPPING policy that is posted all over the restaurant is \"for tax purposes only\" and that she should feel free to tip. This, in my opinion, was very uncool. It was awkward for my sister. The restaurant needs to have one policy and make sure its staff sticks to it. And frankly if the purpose of the no tipping policy is tax evasion, then I want no part of it.\n\nBut that was not the worst part. After the busboy had cleared the table, he turned to another busboy and said, the \"f******* bitch didn't leave a tip\"--all while my sister and 4-year-old niece were still standing there. \n\nNeedless to say, neither I nor any of my future guests will be patronizing Mother's again.", "date": "2013-05-26 06:35:00"}

In fact, it took all of an hour before I found myself at the home of the Ferdi. \n\nThe menu begins with a definition of debris, the drippings and ends of the beef whilst cooking, which are then piled back on.  The menu you get while standing in a long, but rather quick queue that runs along an old, charming brick number in the CBD.  \n\nI had come with friends who had never been to New Orleans -- Mother's is a decent introduction to how things work a little differently here.  Everyone is nice, a little rough around the edges and well-versed in getting people in and out, an efficiency that comes with the practice of having a line out the door every day.  There's no tipping, which at first we'll seem a little strange, until you realize service is provided by an army of servers each bringing out whatever is ready, when it's ready.  The place is huge -- the hold up is getting orders ordered and orders out, not seating.  You can wander around and find room after room of four tops in this old brick building.  \n\nEventually your meal shows up in parts and if you're like most other people, you've ordered the Ferdi ($12), a po' boy made of ham, roast beef and that aforementioned debris, or some variety of it.  \n\nMother's was fairly well known amongst the group that others had, without discussion with the rest of the group, added it to their own personal to-do lists for the weekend.  I had a very fond memory of it from my last visit, which must have been a few years before.  \n\nSadly, I was a little letdown.  \n\nThe sandwich is good, though a little skimpily filled.  Mother's has become a bit of an assembly line and I don't think the end product lived up to my memory of it or the expectations of others in the group.

I spotted a line outside of Mother's while taking a taxi to the Hilton on a Saturday evening. July 13th specifically. Any place with a line outside has to be good right? Right?!\n\nI convinced my family of 7 to take a stroll to the restaurant. A uniformed security person gives you the run down while you are in line outside, you order, get your drinks, go sit at your table and wait for your food to arrive. Simple enough. We ordered a variety of items; fried chicken, gumbo, crawfish etouffee, crabs, red beans and rice, bread pudding...what a feast! If only we actually got to eat any of it. We were told the chicken would take 30 to 40 minutes, fresh to order. No problem! The rest of our order would arrive as it was plated. The time was approximately 7;15PM. \n\nWe sat with our drinks and were ushered to a back room decorated in the fashion of a storage space in a slaughter house, complete with an iron sliding door..We then began our wait. We approached a server who took pity on us and gave us some bread for the children at the 40 minute mark. At 45 min, the etouffee arrived for one person. The children got so hungry at 1 hour that I approached the window where meals seemed to pour out for diners. They were working on our order, the chicken takes time we were told. And hour and a half later my 8 year old was taken back to the hotel.  Still no chicken.  At  9:15pm the chicken arrived with cold, soft shell crab. Upon complaining to one of the two managers on staff he asked \"What do you expect me to do?\". ***Note to management; when customers complain about a 2+ hours wait the FIRST thing that should come out of your mouth is SORRY. SORRY, it goes a long way. No, we never heard sorry, he refused to take any amount off of my bill. So, since the child who ordered the chicken, fries and bread pudding wasn't there, I handed the untouched food  back to him, plate by plate, still steaming after a 2 hour wait. I was refunded the meal I handed back without so much as a Dog kiss my foot..ah well, my money is best spent elsewhere.\n\nWhen I figure out how to post a picture of my receipt it will follow shortly.\n\nReceipt 1191a SvrCk 25 21:17 07/13/13\nDenny A\n\nI need not ever worry about entering this establishment again. \n\nBooks I recommend to read while waiting here: \n\nThe Bible; Old and New Testament - In granting you the serenity to be patient\nA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking - Just to put your wait in perspective\nTime A Traveler's Guide - Clifford A Pickover - My lame attempt at a joke...", "date": "2013-07-22 21:24:44"}

He was particularly excited about Mother's! We ended up eating there twice during our four day stay. The first visit was late afternoon, probably around 3:00. No line like other reviews have mentioned. In fact, there were only a few tables with patrons seated inside. I am sure the off hour was why. Husband ordered the Shrimp Po Boy, he said it was good and there was abundant shrimp on the sandwich. I had the Turkey Ferdi, which is turkey, ham and debris (parts and pieces of pot roast/beef and gravy, tastes like a french dip) topped with mustard, pickles and cabbage: excellent! I really enjoyed the sandwich. \n\nMy only recommendation for the lunch visit would be a better reference on how the patrons are suppose to order. They tell you at the door to grab a menu and order, but it is confusing as to where you are suppose to order. Especially, when no employee is standing where you ARE suppose to order, at the register, but there are A LOT of people standing behind the food area. I saw patron after patron standing or wandering, looking confused. Trying to make eye contact with the ladies standing behind the food, who never acknowledged them or directed them to the correct place to order. This is not a good way to start a meal.  When it is busy and there is a line of people ordering, obviously this would not be a problem, follow the line. When this ordering referene is not avaibable, they need to make people feel more welcome and not assume they know where to go. \n\nOur dinner visit was a few days later and about 6:00ish. Again there was no line. However, the front of the restaurant was full. My husband ordered the Crawfish Etouffe and I ordered the Jambalaya. We both got the greens, I got grits and he got french fries. Husband said his dish was good, as was mine. Average, nothing over the top, which is o.k. The greens were excellent! Being from the south I love some properly seasoned and prepared greens! Mother's greens were great! \n\nHowever, the grits were some of the worse grits I have ever been served! Watery and NO seasoning whatsoever. No salt and no butter! Anyone who knows grits, knows the water must be seasoned while the grits are cooking. You can not season them afterwards, it just doesn't take for some reason. Therefore, they were not eatable. \n\nMother's is very pricey! Lunch meal was over $40.00 for two of us. and the dinner was about the same. Overall, it was a good meal both times. However, I would never pay those prices at home for the same food. Relative to what our hotel was charging it was comparable. All of New Orleans seems to be ridiculously overpriced. Make sure to do your research before assuming it will be an affordable trip! Our food expenses were our biggest expense for the four days. \n\nOverall, I would recommend a visit to Mother's. Try and go during the off hours and you most likely will not have to wait. If you go, I highly recommend the Ferdi sandwich!", "date": "2013-08-31 12:19:25"}

Went there Saturday, December 14, 2013. They were busy with a long line to place order. Cashiers looked as though they were forced to work. No friendly greeting,  smile or please and thank you ever.  One of the cashiers was ringing up order and eating fries. Waited  20 minutes and still didn't receive our order, which  was basically the breakfast special of 2eggs, toast and baked ham; waffle and gumbo. The  waitress then said she gave order to manager to check into it.  Waited another 10 minutes and a manager passed our table and we asked about order again.  He said \"Don't worry about it,  I'll take care of it.\"  Another 10 minutes passed and waffle came,  which was stone cold.  Sent it back.  Came back lukewarm.  Gave up on hope of getting a hot waffle.  Eggs came with grits smothering my eggs.  We had ordered toast instead, since we do not like grits. Instead they gave a mound of grits. We were looking forward to the ham, as it was given high praise in reviews. They gave us dried up end pieces. Gumbo was also lukewarm when we finally got it.  Gave up on hope of being served hot food.  By then just wanted to hurry up and leave with the knowledge of never to come back ever again.  We found it hard to believe one establishment could mess up on a  simple order and not even care about it.  Manager came later to check on our order in an unclear attempt to make things right by saying simply \"Is everything okay and can I get you a bread pudding? \"  Never were we given an apology for the horrible service or left with the feeling we as a customer were of any concern to them.  No matter how busy or famous an establishment is,  the patron should always be made to feel they are appreciated and respected.  We never felt that when we were there and we will never return there or will we recommend it to anyone.

The Po-Boy options are somewhat limited, but if you want Red Beans or Etoufee or a similar New Orleans dish, you could do a lot worse.", "date": "2013-12-18 15:53:59"}

After 24 years of living here, I finally decided to give it a shot. \n\nI want to preface this review by saying I rarely like to leave bad reviews on restaurants I've only eaten at one time.  Every restaurant can have a bad day. However, after talking to some friends and reading some of the reviews online, I feel like my complaints are more a regular thing than an anomaly.\n\nBeing a Monday morning, I wasn't expecting there to be a line, but there was. I'm okay with that. We waited 2.5 hours in Denver at a place called Snooze, but the food and the service made me forget the wait. I can wait for a good dining experience. \n\nSo a 45 min wait in the cold wasn't that bad. However, when we walked into the place, we were immediately yelled at by a rude kitchen worker for standing in the wrong place. I had to bite my tongue because she was going to be touching my food, and we had been waiting way too long to get kicked out 5 feet from the register. \n\nWhen we got to the register, the worker was impatient and didn't give us anytime to ask questions about the menu.  Her attitude was as if we were bothering her by asking questions.  The girl serving the drinks had an expression on her face like she would rather be doing anything else other than what she was doing. My girlfriend was so rushed that she ended up settling for something she wasn't really excited about ordering. \n\nHaving said all of that, I am a very patient and forgiving person. I can put up with all of that if the food is to die for. But sadly, it wasn't. I got the red beans with a side of cabbage and collard greens. The food was very bland. I had to cover it in salt and pepper and hot sauce to allow me to enjoy it. Their \"famous\" ham, wasn't even in the top 10 of baked ham I've had in south Louisiana.  \n\nMy girlfriend's jambalaya was just not very good either. Maybe I've been spoiled by really good Cajun food, growing up here. And maybe tourists from out of town would enjoy this because they don't know any better. But for someone who enjoys good food coupled with a good dining experience, this was just one big disappointment. It was such a bad experience that I was tempted to tell everyone in line to not waste their time and go somewhere else. \n\nThere was a sign on the wall that said no tipping. And that probably sums up the root of the problem. The workers are likely underpaid and under appreciated. I would rather leave a big fat tip and enjoy my experience than not have to tip and suffer through such a lack luster eating experience. \n\nWill probably never return to eat here.", "date": "2013-12-31 17:57:02"}

Since our hotel is pretty much across the street and we saw lines morning and evening we had to try it out.\n\nWe showed up around 8:30pm and waited less than 10m outside. The line inside took longer, maybe 15m. We get to the cashier, pay for our food and drink, and then we don't know what we are supposed to do. We sit in the back room, the waiter come and pick our ticket and drop it at the kitchen. After waiving him he told us we have to get our drinks upfront. An other line, shorter, the drinks lady was not there when we paid but the cashier should have told us to wait for her.\n\nWe wait probably 20m+ for the food to arrive. In the mean time the table next to us waive a waiter about their fried chicken, which let to some argument between him, the waiter assigned to the table, and the restaurant manager. Not very professional to argue in front of the customer. The couple that was before us was still waiting for their order when we left: they ordered fried chicken. It looks like the fried chicken is only cooked on order, but hen only when the waiter bring the order to the kitchen and for the kitchen to pick it up. I recommend the manager to have the cashier to trigger the fried chicken right away when it is paid for. This would cut at least 15m to the customer wait. Also since their are always fried chicken orders and that it takes so long, I don't know why they can't have some chickens in the frier at all times. Just to make sure the waits won't be so long.\n\nOne if the waiters from the front room was throwing dirty dishes in a bucket near us and that was really loud and annoying.\n\nNow we did get our food and we cannot complain about our waiter, he was prompt when called and looked professional. I can't say as much from the other waiter, looked like there was some tension between them. Most of what we order only needed playing (gumbo, soup, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, sausages) the only thing done to order was the fried seafood. It should really not take that long.\n\nThe food was tasty and plentiful, but not outstanding. The staff could be a little more professional in general (keep arguments away from the customers), make less noise when clearing plates, and improve the soft drinks issue (why a line for that).\n\nIf they can improve the time to plate and serve the turnaround will be faster and the wait lines shorter...

As you are waiting in line you can see the service line where all the food is located. While waiting in line you see ALL that goes on while the food is being prepared. It was a sloppy mess. It reminded me of a high school cafeteria buffet line. That wasn't the worst part. A young lady was leaning over the food and as she was preparing a customers plate she coughed over all of the food that she was hovering over. She looked up at me and must have read the disgust on my face because she rolled her eyes and yelled out, \"ain't nobody got time for that\".

You order at a counter and the food is brought to you when you pick a table to sit at with a waiter coming over to take your ticket. It only took about 10 minutes to get our food and I immediately started into the sandwich. It was very messy and unfortunately not as flavorful as I had expected for something consisting of debris, which is the roast beef that falls into the gravy while baking in the oven. One of my sandwich halves had only a small amount of ham and it could have used some salt or other seasoning to bring out the flavors a little more. Overall, I would not be likely to return to try this sandwich, but I would go back to try something else like the jambalaya that looked really tasty. I would give the food 2 stars and the service was very friendly and is the reason that I am giving this place 3 stars instead.", "date": "2014-01-06 01:28:22"}

As one does at all fine dining establishments. There I found a line of other duped patrons. A menu is flung at us with the same carelessness. We're being treated with the same delicateness the pigs on their menu were treated, so I suppose it's only fair. \n\nMy order is taken abruptly, and I'm given a receipt and a cup of water. (The water lady was actually really sweet). I sit. I wait. 15 minutes. Only then does the frazzled waitress come to me with her eyes looking everywhere but into my own. \"Can I have your ticket?\" You mean my order hasn't even gone in yet? 20 minutes and four reminders later, she finally brings me my sandwich. \n\nOkay great - moment of truth. I can look past all the dilapidated social compasses. As long as the food is good.

That's right, what was supposed to be a nice crusty roll, is just a Wonderbread waste product sitting in a pool of water. The bottom of the bread now completely soaked reminiscent of a freshly christened diaper. This was supposedly their \"gravy\". However, mine was simply clear tap water that a piece of meat may or may not have been in at some point. \n\nBut, at least the meat was cold.

It was just awful as I sat there thinking of what canned microwaveable meal I'd be eating when I came home to supplement this travesty. \n\nLet it be known that this was my Second venture to this restaurant. The first, a similarly poor experience, I chalked it up to a bad day, bad timing, so I returned to give them a second chance. Silly rabbit. \n\nI guess I'm mad because this place had a name, but now it's just a name, whatever flavors and energy started this place years ago have long fled. It used to have story, a legend. But if you stick a piece of shit in Superman's cape, it's not going to fly. \n\n- YelpO", "date": "2014-01-19 04:55:23"}

As other reviews have stated, there is a line, but it moved quickly when we went there on a Saturday afternoon around 3:00pm.  They have a system down pat: menus are passed out to the customers in queue so that you should know what you want once you get inside the doors and up to the register.  I had my first po-boy here, the Debris, which is roast beef pieces inside of a French roll.  Wowza, this was a good sandwich!  It was also large enough to share, but I didn't. Well, the b/f had a few bites.  I didn't finish it, either, so maybe I should have split it with someone else. I had a side of dirty rice, as well, which is only available on Saturdays, so take advantage of this if you visit on that day; it was very flavorful.  My friends all enjoyed their dishes, which is as good as sign as any.  The customer service we received from our waiter was excellent, Southern charm all the way.  Even though there are signs that say tipping is not allowed, we asked our waiter if this was enforced.  His answer was that the signs were posted years ago and that if we wanted to tip, we could, so we did.  I'm definitely a fan.", "date": "2014-02-05 04:54:56"}

This place was recommended from a friend of ours and by some Yelp friends as well. So if you read a few of the reviews already, Mother's gets a lot of attention and a lot of traffic.  There's usually a line outside, but for us, it went by really quick.  \n\nCouple of other things to point out...\n-They don't seem too patient for you to make up your mind so be prepared, be very prepared on what you want to order. \n-While in line, you'll be given a menu to that you're prepared to order\n-Seating is first come, first serve\n-This is a fast paced restaurant.  Don't worry, you're allowed to linger and they don't kick you out.  But because your order is taken so quick and the employees are constantly cleaning tables, you may feel rushed.  \n-Known for their ham, but it's their Po Boy sandwiches that dominates the menu.\n-Tips:  There's signs everywhere stating that they do not accept tips.  But we were educated by one of the employees that told us that those signs were posted back in 1939.  In other words, tips aren't expected but welcomed\n-They serve an average of 2,000 orders per day.  Some orders can be a low as a single guest or as high as group of people.  Do the math, that's a lot of Po' Boys being served.  \n\nMy Dishes:  \nJerry's Jambalaya ($6.50 for a cup):  Of course, I got their Jambalaya. Not the best that I've had, but good enough for me to finish.  I got mine with sausage and chicken.  It wasn't too spicy, but still had a kick to it. Yes, I deMELished it. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=v4JG_fM6tCBTJYppdEDUMQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nFamous Ferdi Special ($11.75 Reg): They're known for this Po' Boy, so of course I got this. This Po' Boy included their famous ham, roast beef, debris, gravy, pickles, and mustard.  I was impressed with the meats in my Po' Boy due to the flavor and the amount that they hooked up.  However, I wasn't too impressed with the bread and thought that the mustard & pickles overwhelmed the meats. I had to try this and it was still good. I recommend if you're visiting Mother's for the first time. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=P0cU9XSGXdIzeKqYQ2diOA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nOur group of 6 had a mix of what Mother's had to offer.  The gf had their Debris, which she didn't finish since it was huge.  But she liked it.  Others in our group got their Shrimp Creole, Shrimp Po' Boy, and Seafood Gumbo. I didn't try their orders, but was told that by them that they were completely satisfied, especially with the Shrimp Creole.  \n\nPrice:\n-Breakfast ($3-$12.50):  I think most were on the high side\n-Po' Boys ($9.50-$17.50)  Priced just about right depending on what you get and what size. \n-Plates ($11-$19):  Great deals here\n-Seafood ($16-$25.50):  Average\n\nMother's has a enough on their menu to keep everyone happy. Overall, I have to say that I'm a fan.  \n\nGot Ham?:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PlFqlsmfXZ2UUmFK6ftgJg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nPS: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OE8TUj3joAkyoRfTK-OevQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (031/366)", "date": "2014-02-05 17:15:46"}

In order to not crowd the inside of the restaurant they will have people stand in a queue outside and then allow about 10 or so people to go in.  When you get in you still have to stand in line.  The way the line is it does feel like a greasy old diner and almost reminded me of a soup kitchen line but not free of course.  While you are in line you will pass the area where they have some of the food but you order when you get to the cashier.  They are one of the few places that will take credit cards thank god!  \nOnce you place your order, you take your receipt and drink with you and find a table.  This isn't clear when you first get your receipt.  You can sit anywhere that's open and then the staff will come by and take your receipt and bring back to the table.  One of the waitstaff was a bit rude and seemed annoyed by me asking her anything that I was scared to ask her anything like how do I get my coffee. Eventually she became nicer but  I'm guessing she probably realized I was not drunk and wasn't being rude to her.  \nI ordered the waffles with blueberry compote.  It was good but I wouldn't say anything extraordinary.  By far I think I was just impressed with how good the bloody mary was!

Awesome!\n\nCame back for breakfast a couple of days later and enjoyed the 2 - egg special.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Mothers!", "date": "2014-03-18 23:01:34"}

Both he and my son devoured it !!! My only reason for not giving this place 5 stars was the staff at the checkout counter. The guy outside dealing with the line was nice even though I'm sure people were irritated with the line, our server who brought the food was nice as well. Had no idea how things worked here since we had never been. Stood in line outside, fine by me, it was a nice day! Stood in line inside , was hectic cause we were in between tables and the kitchen with people coming and going. But hey, works for them so I went with the flow! Again, the staff that takes your orders needs a personality check, they were so rude and rushed us. I understand they are busy but you are in the business of dealing with tourists who have never been. Have a little patients. Order came out wrong cause they didn't listen to the order... Will definitely go back next time we are there just hope the front counter is a little nicer!!", "date": "2014-03-19 17:07:07"}

Let me paint a picture for you. It was a breezy New Orleans evening and I was standing in line between a family of eight and two French tourists. The line outside of Mother's was inexplicably long, which is good for Mother's bad for someone who's just hungry and needs a grab and go meal. \n\nThere was a security guard at the helm of the restaurant, passing menus down the ever growing line behind me. He let us in two, three, and one at a time. When I stepped into Mother's, it was packed. This is obviously a big tourist trap in the city and I can see why. Between all the autographed pictures of celebrities and New Orleans Saints paraphernalia, the walls were bursting with kitsch . \n\nYou order in a long line that spans the length of the restaurant while about twenty workers with gold teeth pack the food in front of you. When it was finally my time to order, I couldn't get my credit card out fast enough for the cashier who was already taking the French tourists order behind me. I ordered the Jerry's Jambalaya which came out fast enough. After all, all they had to do was scoop it out of the serving trays and slap it into some to go containers. Seeing as how there was no where to sit and I didn't want to hang around in the sardine container of a restaurant any longer, I took my meal to go. \n\nThe food was not bad and for the price of a $15 platter, I got a lot of it. I had the Jambalaya, the greens, and grits. The grits tasted like cardboard and I ended up tossing them, but everything else was alright. \n\nAs for my over all review, the place was alright.

You order from a register when you get to the front of the line, then you leave and take your receipt to whichever table. A bus/server will wander around and look at the receipts on the table to know where to take food to.

We arrived and found a place in the back of the line at 8:00pm.  After waiting for 20 minutes, we found ourselves facing the windows to the kitchen.  We noticed that employees were heating previously prepared, clear plastic bags of sauce in the kitchen. We weren't sure what to think of it, but kept waiting in line.  After waiting over an hour, we finally had the chance to order in the restaurant.  I ordered a crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e platter with potato salad and red beans with rice.   We then sat down at an empty table.  Our server came up to us almost immediately, greeted us warmly, and then disappeared.  He returned with our food 15 minutes later, almost 1.5 hours since we first got into line outside the restaurant.\n\nWhen my traveling companion and I first put our fork into our meals, we did so with great expectations.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  My \u00e9touff\u00e9e had very little crawfish, and was lacking in flavor.  It tasted bland.  The potato salad was also bland, and was quite dry.  I can make better at home.  The beans also had very little flavor.  I'm not sure if it is because the kitchen staff is reheating previously prepared food, as we saw outside the restaurant, but the food just had very little flavor, and did not taste that great.  My roommate also got the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e with ham, and they were also both bland.  In comparison to other meals that we have had elsewhere during our stay in New Orleans, this meal was completely forgettable.  There are many other, better restaurants in New Orleans.  Why settle for one that clearly started to rest on its laurels years ago?  I can't help but think that President Bush, Governor Christie, and all the other famous luminaries whose faces dot the walls, received a freshly prepared meal that was nothing short of outstanding.

There are so many great places here, you cannot visit all of them and most of them, you will love.  So why this place?  First of all, when they open, the sun is shining bright and is extremely hot if you stood outside.  Why is this important?  Because the line is a mile long and the wait is equally long.  You will suffer from the heat.  However, don't walk away.  Stand in it.  You will not regret it.  Plus, standing in line will allow you to meet new people.  When you finally get inside, you will think this place is a dump.  Well, because it is.  Some of the best places I've eaten were in dives.  It sure feels like Disney.  You stand in a long line, finally get inside and stand in another line.  Grab a menu and study it.  You will have time.  When you finally get up to the register, order your food.  They will give you a receipt and then it's off to find yourself a table.  Good luck with that too.  The place is small, but hold a pretty good size crowd.  When you sit down, a waitress will pick up your receipt, get your drinks and eventually deliver your food.  They have many varieties of the Po Boy, but get yourself an oyster or seafood one.  They are heaven.  Best ones I've ever had.  We also ordered some gumbo and jambalaya as well and holy crap, they were awesome.  Explosive taste and exceptionally delicious.  Food was cheap and much better than the high end restaurants on Bourbon Street that I ate (although they were good too).  I must have stood in line for over an hour and after I ate, I realize it was worth the wait twice as long.  Don't be discourage with the long lines; I think you'll agree that it's one of the best in the city.  It's a can't miss, must do, period.", "date": "2014-08-14 03:42:26"}

The last time i was at Mothers, was in June of 2005, a month and a half before Katrina hit. AND LET ME TELL YOU. That was some of the best food I've ever had. My little Yankee heart raved about it. I told friends, I told family, I told strangers I met on the street. The counter ladies were quick, but not rude, but that may have been due to the fact that my dinner guest had been my 80 year old grandmother who took her sweet time despite being hustled through the line (it takes a lot to phase an elderly Italian woman). I had the fried soft shell crabs and fries with collards and bread pudding, and I'm pretty sure I gained at least three points on my cholesterol because of it, but man was it worth it! \n \nThe place was a hole in the wall, and I'm pretty sure the table we sat at was missing a leg (or two). It was all communal, and I'm not sure where the people we sat with were from, but it wasn't the South or even America (Canada, maybe? I want to say Canada.) but man were they impressed. I don't think I've ever seen 5 happier people at a rickety 3 legged table in a literal hole-in-the-wall eating some of the best Southern Food I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.  \n \nMy recent visit has been slightly different. Maybe its because the company was different (my grandmother has been gone for some time now), or, maybe, its still the remnants of the hurricane. The prices have increased, but that's normal, and the food is still good, but I don't think they serve fried soft shells anymore. But they weren't in season for my last visit anyway. It has gotten touristy. Like TOURISTY. And people will complain. Which makes me complain. About people complaining. Go figure. Yes, the ladies can be rude. I'd be touchy too if I had to hustle 5,000 people in and out of my restaurant everyday too! But, the food is excellent, the atmosphere, though changed, is still one of a kind, and when soft shelled crabs do make their big reappearance, I definitely suggest them!", "date": "2014-08-19 20:14:05"}

So, now there's always a long line in front of it which leads people to think that this is a great place to eat. Well, I can tell ya'll that it sure ain't! First thing, the service was absolutely abysmal - when I walked inside late in the evening, the place was only half full, so, not busy at all but I was completely ignored by all the wait staff that was just \"hangin' aroun doin' nothin'.\"  When I eventually figured out on my own that this was a go-up-to-the-counter-and-place-your-own-order kind o' deal, the dude there told me to \"grab one o' dem menus over dare and order what you want over dare...\" and that was it for the service... So, I ordered the specialty of the house - \"the world's best baked ham,\" turnip greens, red beans and rice (one of my favorite Cajun dishes) and grits. All of the side dishes were nothing special - very ordinary BUT the ham in particular was ridiculously disappointing... Instead of a nice thick slab of real meat that was piping hot or at least warm, I received six very thinly sliced cold cuts(!) that were - cold! Where the hell was I? In a Subway Sandwich shop??!! This was utterly outrageous! What self-respecting bona-fide southern eatery would ever serve baked ham in such an appalling manner??? AND it was utterly tasteless to boot... \"the world's best baked ham,\" eh? In a pig's eye (literally speaking)! I'm absolutely BALLISTIC that they took me for a fool who didn't know the difference between \"ham sandwich cold cuts\" and \"baked dinner ham\" and dared to serve me this travesty. So, DO NOT make a fool of yourself and stand in the long line to get into this sham of a \"southern restaurant\" - you will REALLY regret it...", "date": "2014-10-17 12:28:42"}

So while I am no means a Nola expert, I consider myself pretty damn well-versed in Southern fare and reasonably so in Cajun cuisine. That being said, Mother's has the best down home food in the city. Certainly not the nicest atmosphere or best service (you can try Galatoire's or Antoine's for that) but the closest to what your mother makes if you're from the low country like me (obviously this joint is aptly named). Be prepared to wait in line and realize that the kitchen and waitstaff can't accept tips, so don't be impatient. The staff behind the counter is trained to be \"mean\" to speed up the process. They hand out menus in line, so know what you want in advance. Pay attention to what the black ladies behind the counter are talking about, they always know what's good. After you've ordered and found a seat, if you are very friendly (yes ma'am and no sir to the older workers, even if you're grown!) you can get advice on what to order next time and they may expedite your service. The bad reviews I've seen are from people that went in expecting too much from this humble institution, so let me give a few tips. Don't be afraid to ask your waiter if you need your food heated up. They will happily oblige (my friend got her gumbo warmed up last time we were there). This is a common problem because of the food line setup, but on the bright side, it does enable faster service. Now time for an unpopular opinion: the debris poboy is the most overrated menu item. Don't get me wrong, it still beats the shit out of a lot of other poboys I've had, but it's basically just pulled beef covered in gravy, which you can make pretty easily by letting beef sit in a slow cooker for several hours. As a result, it has that delicious, fall-off-the-bone quality. However, as gravy is one of my favorite sauces, I must say Mother's is quite lacking. While it has enough salt, it doesn't have the proper seasoning that comes from the homemade pan scrapin's kind and it's isn't thick enough, which means the roux needs to be cooked longer. The debris is better on the Ferdi, Ralph or John G., where the other meats give it more flavor. My favorites here are the breakfast special with scrambled eggs, fried ham and smoked sausage (it only comes with one meat, but spare a few bucks and get both), the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e in its many reiterations (including an omelet, plate, and on its own), the oysters, shrimp and catfish all deep fried and served in poboy or plate form (with tons of extra tartar sauce), the seafood gumbo, and the fried chicken plate. Give 'em twenty or thirty minutes for cooking time on that last one but it'll be damn worth it (theirs could rival my own grandmother's but shh don't tell her that!) If you want something large enough to share, the seafood platters are also fabulous, especially the soft shell crabs. For sides, the cabbage, turnip greens and grits are incredible (the vegetables are cooked in their famous ham, which gives them wonderful flavor). They serve breakfast all day, so make sure you get a biscuit regardless of what you order. They are made in true Southern fashion, with high quality flour, buttermilk and lard. Load one up with butter and their house-made raspberry preserves and you have the perfect finishing touch to your meal. If you go on a Saturday, I suggest the turtle soup and the fried chicken special. Turtle soup is a Creole delicacy and theirs is an excellent rendition, while the dirty rice served with the special is phenomenal. If by some bizarre stretch, you still have room for dessert after all of that, order the pecan pie. I always end up leaving with enough food for an army in take away boxes and getting it anyway. And don't forget to get a World Famous, a fruit punch based cocktail even better than a hurricane. P.S. Go between 7:30 and 9:30 am on a weekday to qualify for the early bird special on the breakfast option I mentioned and save $!", "date": "2014-10-31 13:35:25"}

If you have ever traveled to Philly and have heard the stories of going to the tourist traps of Pat/Geno's for a cheesesteak - you know that you need to know your order before you hit the line (Think Seinfeld-Soup Nazi)...LOL\n\nOnce you zero in on your order - you will be happy with the choice - my group tried different items and everyone was satisfied with their order.  I wanted to try the \"world famous baked ham\".  I know you wonder- how can you make Ham world famous - well - they manage to do it - very tasty!!  Friends had the Debris Po-Boy, Pancakes, all the main items - everyone's plates were clean within 15 minutes.  \n\nThe service is quick and efficient.  You order your food - Deli style..Pay for it - find a table - waitstaff come over and take your receipts and bring your food to the table.  It is a well oiled machine in there - so anything that throws it off (not knowing what you want..etc) you are going to hear about it...LOL\n\nThe staff were friendly and kind, so I think overall it made a good experience.  \n\nTip:  No fried foods before 10:30AM.", "date": "2014-11-06 04:13:00"}

First, let me say that I intended to take a photo of my food because it was the photos that helped me decide what to get. However, I took one bite and just didn't stop.\nMy husband and I are in town for the 49ers game and walked past as we were on our way to check in across the street at the Staybridge. In planning our first trip to New Orleans, I yelped A LOT and got recommendations from friends on where to go and what to do. I then created an itinerary of suggestions venues, for breakfast, lunch, dinner etc. \nLet's just say, I'm baffled as to why this place wasn't mentioned by friends or why I hadn't come across it before on Yelp.  I only decided to look up the menu because after my nap, I was hungry and dinner was still a few hours away. The reviews were positive and thanks helpers for the photos because, they helped me decide.  I ordered the shrimp po' boy and sweet potato pie for hubby and I got the combination platter and the brownie. Now, I will say I got the combo platter because I wanted to try a few things... It came with crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, red beans, jambalaya, potato salad and one veggie - I got the greens. I totally expected to taste the potato salad and give it to hubby since I don't usually like potato salad. But I only let him taste it and I ate the whole thing! Then the greens... I only got them because my side had to be a vegetable but I don't like greens. Well, if all greens tasted like these, maybe I would. Total yum and I ate the whole thing. That's why I had to write a review. \nFinally, the staff was very friendly! Wonderful customer service even though I'm a 49ers fan, one of the guys actually helped me carry my bag of food and my drinks across the street to the hotel. \nShould definitely try this place!", "date": "2014-11-09 00:06:47"}

I got a cup of the chicken & sausage gumbo, a \"ferdi\" sandwich, and some bread pudding. Let me go in order. \n\nThe gumbo was fine. Not spectacular but tasty. Adding some hot sauce definitely improved it. I would not be opposed to having it again. \n\nThe roast beef ferdi was fantastic. I start on the sandwich and it's made with a sturdy roll but there's not much on the inside. Then I make the connection - I'm supposed to be adding the \"debris\". What is debris? It's like shredded beef in jus. For lack of a better description, it's like a French dip, but the dip is filled with beef. Definitely worth ordering again. \n\nThen I decide to break into the bread pudding. It's one of my favorite desserts and I have had a number of different styles. (When motivated, I make a pretty good bread pudding too.) The Mothers version was more like bread stew...in a good way. Remember the sturdy sandwich rolls? I presume that's what they're using for the pudding, and with good reason. They stand up well in the tasty broth. Add some fruit and we have a winner.

Be prepared to stand in line, but the actual process of ordering, finding a seat, and receiving the food is on par and often better than a sit down restaurant. We were referred to Mother's by other visitors to NOLA. \n\nFood ordered: a order of the red beans and rice with hot smoked sausage, turnip greens, and potato salad and a order of the 2/3 Ferdi PoBoy. Unsweetened tea to drink. It totaled to almost $30, but with no tip (if that's your thing).\n\nAll in all, very good food. The turnip greens were delicious and the much boasted Ferdi PoBoy lived up to its reputation. The rice used in the red beans and rice was had that very bland, over starchy taste too it, but the red bean gravy was good. Sausage was very good as well but has a typical taste one could find at market. Next time (and there will be one) I'll skip on the potato salad and just order French fries. \n\nOnto service: you must know what you want by the time you reach the end of the line. The cashier is very matter of fact with you and will not put up with anyone slowing down the line. She about bit the guy-in-front of-me's head off for trying to order the Two Egg Breakfast special as a one egg special and trying to argue with her about it. She did miss hear my husband's order of lemonade to drink as a tea with lemon. Usual order of this is once you finish ordering and the cashier tells you the amount, the cashier begins taking the order of the next guest as you fish out your wallet. Cash and credit cards are accepted. \n\nTo continue, once you order, you find a seat. My husband and I found a small little two-top in the next room. It was comfortably cool. The server came to the table and took out receipt. In about ten minutes, she returned with our food. Tea refills are allowed, but you have to ask. \n\nBest thing: Ferdi PoBoy and the Turnip Greens. I could of ate a huge plate of those turnip greens and drank a cup of that turnip juice.\n\nOther interesting facts: there are signs around the restaurant telling customers not to tip. \n\nAll in all, a very good trip.

We walked across the french quarter and the two or so streets up from where we had been just for this lunch.\n\nThere was a line, but not one out the door like we had seen so we thought we'd really lucked out!  We got in line with our menus delivered to us at the door.  Most of that time we were in the way of someone- be it customer struggling to find a seat or one of the staff demanding that we clear a path.  (Rudely so I might add, there wasn't really anywhere to move TO and we were trying very hard to keep out of the way.)\n\nWhen we got up to the counter, we ordered red beans and rice, a Ferdi po boy, and a catfish po boy.  I'm not sure what our fourth had - something ham or chicken on a sandwich.  \n\nSeating was a nightmare.  We wandered several minutes attempting to find a spot and once we found an empty (but dirty) table, we quickly sat down to try and save it for our family.  The waitress came over and took our ticket to the window (seemed like an odd practice in its own?) but forgot the second ticket so our order was staggered.  It took several minutes for someone to come and clean the table and honestly the staff didn't seem all that concerned about it.  I realize that the restaurant was busy, and we knew when we sat down that it was a dirty table but several workers passed us and it almost seemed like they were pretending not to notice the state of several of the much needed tables.  \n\nThe ferdi and red beans and rice came first.  It was almost fifteen minutes later that the third and fourth plates came to our table.  The ferdi seemed to have been sitting not in gravy but in a juice that came from the meat - not a problem if you're ready to eat but it arrived at the table with the typically tougher french bread already soaked through and breaking apart.  I barely got a bite in before the whole thing disintegrated and became impossible to eat without relying heavily on napkins and forks.  The red beans and rice was what my boyfriend called 'okay'.  I think he just didn't want to admit that he'd paid so much for an over salty plate that really lacked flavor.\n\nWhen the other plates finally did come, my mother who had ordered the catfish poboy took her first bite and immediately spit her food out. This woman LOVES catfish and I've never seen her send back a dish.  She pushed her plate aside after a second and third attempt dissecting the plate trying to find which part was so offensive.  She said the fish was mushy and muddy.  \n\nTables around us were filled with families, one was a couple with three small children.  The parents and one of the children received their meals but the other two sat there for almost twenty minutes without their plates after their family was initially served - when the plates arrived?  Pancakes.  They'd waited an additional twenty minutes for two short stacks. Even then, the mother had an order of a biscuit that took additional time to be delivered, she seemed done with her meal by that point.\n\nAfter watching my mother miss a meal because of the food quality, we urged her to complain to the manager.  To his credit, he did offer to replace her dish but she was so turned off at that point that she just wanted a refund which he DID provide without argument.  He brought her cash (15 dollars for an inedible plate) and some bread pudding to try and make up for it.  While he was delivering the plate, however, he tipped it forward and poured the sauce all over the table and down my mother's pant leg.  He didn't seem to realize.  She had to decline the desert and tell him that she was a diabetic but he left the plate anyway saying that one of us would eat it.  We tried a few bites while my mother and sister went to the bathroom and attempted to clean the sticky mess up.  She spent the rest of the day covered in the dark goo.\n\nWe aren't typically very fussy people, we were eager to try a legendary place in New Orleans but we were HEAVILY disappointed.  This place seems to survive on reputation alone and ignore a lot of basic service needs and food quality.  Tourists, don't listen to the hype.", "date": "2015-01-04 02:08:03"}

The red beans and rice were bland while the debris was a salt lick. The Ferdi fell apart because it was so soaked in the debris gravy. The sandwich came to the table already soaked and fell apart within the first bite or two. Our dining partner's catfish po-boy was so muddy that she was unable to eat more than a few bites. \n\nThe service was unacceptably slow. While I realize that it is not unreasonable to wait during lunchtime it should not take nearly 30 minutes for 3 sandwiches and an entr\u00e9e,  two of the plates (the Ferdi and red beans and rice) were out within 15 minutes,  the rest of our party waited nearly another 15 minutes for their food. Tables only receiving half of their orders at a time seemed to be a common occurrence at the surrounding tables. The manager did refund part of our order for the catfish and attempted to make it up to us by giving us a bread pudding although a lack of attention meant he spilled caramel sauce down the leg of one of my dining partners. \n\nOverall Mother's did not live up to it's reputation. The prices, quality of food and service do not make the line worth it. This is definitely a must-skip on our next trip to New Orleans.", "date": "2015-01-04 02:18:38"}

I was hungry after spending the afternoon in the Treme and visiting the cemeteries. Lots of walking. I hit it just right as I went in exactly before the line started to form. I walked in, stood behind one person and ordered. I got a seat no problem. Behind me , a line formed all the way outside the door down the sidewalk.It seemed to move pretty fast though to me, and the tables around me turned over fairly quickly. \n\nThis is an old fashioned joint that has been around since the 50's. It has that look and feel. It was packed and it was not fancy or anything. The place was buzzing with business. Yep, you are going to be leaning up against someone's table while you wait, your behind will hit thier back, and your purse will probably hit thier head. You probably won't get a table right away, you will be on top of people.The walls are  covered in pictures of all the  famous people , locals and military that have eaten there. Lots to look at. You order, pay and  then you sit down and they bring it to you if you stay.When you see a big line you might consider taking it to go. Getting mad about not finding a seat when it is cram packed with a line out the door and down the street seems like a waste of energy. Cleanliness wise , Like I mentioned it is old fashioned and a bit dated, and it is just constant turnover, so I imagine there get to be straw wrappers etc., left on the tables that  they don't get to, but my table was clean and I had condiments.There were people running around with brooms and rags the whole time I was there.  I did sit a \" used \" table that was recently vacated and they came and wiped it within minutes, before the food came. For my particular order, I had fast service.  \n\n They won't take tips... they are just nice people. Great prices for the quality. They served  my  bloody mary out of one of those old aerator machines, way cool. I got the soft-shell crab sandwich. I must say it was one of the best things I have ever eaten, period. Perfect. The bread was so soft and fresh and the crab was cooked perfect. Seasoned perfect. The slaw was great, nice and light, crisp.  I know a line is no fun, but it was worth it. I can see how it could be a tourist trap, but it was 50/50 filled with locals and tourists.

Add two sodas, the bill came out to almost $50...damn, that's an expensive lunch.  The Ferdi was definitely large enough to split between two people.  The sandwich was good, a little soggy for my taste.  Their \"world-famous ham\" was meh.  Didn't taste amazing or anything special, really.  I've had better ham from the grocery store deli.  I had a little of the s/o's Seafood Platter.  It was the first time I've ever had catfish and I liked it.  The fried shrimp was good too.\n\nAgain, I can't stress enough that eating at the resto can feel unnerving and chaotic.

She got our food to us quickly, refilled our drinks, and brought a smile to everyone's face.  There's a sign that says \"No Tipping\" but I'm sorry, we gave her a $20, and she deserved it.  On our way out, we heard one of the customers talking to a manager about Joyce and how she should get tips, but his response was, \"due to tax reasons...\" Mmm hmm...I forgot we were in a red state.\n\nAlthough the food was okay, if we ever find our way back to NOLA, I'd come back to give them a second chance and try something different.\n\n#TIP!!!", "date": "2015-01-27 20:12:23"}

Felt like boot camp with a little more class, hurry up Soldier and get in line. Oh yeah, breakfast lots of Grits and Sausage :-)", "date": "2015-02-19 07:06:37"}

I am not a huge sub sandwich person and these are the first Po' Boys I've ever enjoyed. The Ferdi has baked ham, roast beef and \"debri\" which is the roast beef that falls off into the gravy while being slow cooked. So everything is tender and saucy. Though left with the impression the sandwich would be in au jus, it had the texture of a dipped sandwich (soggy with some crispness on the outside) and an additional gravy that tasted like Russian sauce as used in a rueben which may be why I loved it. I thought all of the flavors and textures complimented one another. My brother thought it was too soggy. The other recommended sandwich - half oyster half shrimp tasted like any Po' boy, so if subs are your thing, this is a good place to try out for a New Orleans twist.  \n\nThe bread pudding was great.

Mothers is one of the best meals we've had so far in New Orleans.\n\nI had the oyster and shrimp poboy, it was quite delicious. The shrimp were especially tasty and large!! I also had a cup of Mae's Fil\u00e9 Gumbo. There were some great spices and flavors inside. It wasn't all that spicy to me, but then again I'm pretty accustomed to spicy food. Definitely yummy though. \n\nDad had the shrimp poboy, said the bread wasn't the best for a poboy. Although he thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp so anything with shrimp here is apparently a good bet! \n\nMom had the debris poboy, one of their more famous items on the menu. Said the roast beef was packed with flavor. I tried a bite myself, tender and delicious! \n\nA large table behind us was raving about the baked ham, which led me to have slight regret that we didn't try Mother's trademark meat! So even though I have not tried it, taking it from the word of people we spoke to, ham is probably awesome here. We also saw potato salad that looked good on people's plates as we were walking by.\n\nI couldn't resist trying some desserts while there, considering the line takes forever. We had the bread pudding and the walnut brownie. I am a brownie lover and this one was gooey and awesome....however if you're going to grab dessert I would definitely get bread pudding. It's like eating a cloud. It came close to my grandmothers and that is saying a ton. Can we say sugar coma? Haha :-)\n\nObviously the line is pretty long, we went around 1:30 and it was still packed. People will pass back their menus through the line though! And the price is just about the same as anywhere else around the area, if you're trying to get a poboy or seafood. I cringed when I saw the bill but I'm glad to say it was worth the price and definitely surpassed my expectations. I will without a doubt be back at Mothers!", "date": "2015-03-30 20:20:06"}

The grits came with slabs of butter on the side. The grits had a nice texture, but needed hot sauce and butter. \nMy dad said his debris was nothing special, even though it looked delicious- the roast beef juice was dripping down the sides and the bread was sopping up all the flavor. \nMy ham dinner was a winner! The ham was just like they advertised: sweet, smokey, and tender. I had three sides with it: collard greens, green beans and tomatoes, and red beans and rice. It's obvious that ham is mother's specialty, because it was in EVERYTHING. Not that I'm complaining. But if you're Jewish, sorry. \nThe green beans were sooooooooooo surprisingly good.

The gravy is good, but I felt it needed more seasoning as Johnny's Po-boys had better tasting gravy, in my opinion.  My major complaints would be how the ham contained bits of ligaments, making some bites unenjoyable and the bread used here could be softer.  Other than that, pretty good roast beef--I'd be happy to eat that alone with some rice. \n\nCombo Fried Shrimp and Oyster Po-boy ($18.00)- I've never seen a place be so generous with their fried shrimp and oyster!  Both are large, filling and overly battered with what tastes like Creole Seasoning.  I'm not one to complain about something being too battered and deep fried, but I think Mother's scales the line with that as their stuff took time to chew. At meal's end, my jaws and inner cheeks were in pain. I know...first world problems. Lol. I finished this item, but felt the fried shrimp is better at Killer Poboys and the fried oysters are better at Stanleys.  Still admirable here though, especially how they give you so much.\n----\nConclusion: Closer to 3.5 Stars and kind of a tourist trap. Despite being named Mother's, I did not receive any motherly type of care at this establishment.  The service here is poor, pushy, impatient, and unfriendly.  Maybe they should rename this place to Step-Mother's Restaurant. Lol.  Anyhow, both the sandwiches are worth a try, just be prepared for a heavy meal.\n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Inside may make you feel claustrophobic as it can get crowded.\n-Decor seems outdated and slightly dirty.  Wish it was brighter inside too.\n-Atmosphere is kind of hectic and employees aren't the best\n-Restrooms could be cleaner", "date": "2015-04-17 00:46:44"}

We placed our orders, paid and found seating in the back area. The building is definitely old, but that doesn't bother me (as long as the food is good).\nA server sat us at a small table along the wall.

At one point, I dropped my fork and asked our server for another. She was standing on the other side of the table beside us. She handed two rolls of silverware to a lady eating at the table and sternly told her to hand them to me. I thought it was the funniest thing ever! Her tone meant business! The lady was a good sport and made a joke about it.\n\nBreakfast is served all day, so that's what I ordered: waffle, black ham, egg white omelet with onion, green pepper, spinach, mushroom. Ham was delicious, reminded of childhood dinners at my Grandmother's. Waffle was good, omelet was okay.  It came with half a plate of grits that I didn't touch.\nHe ordered the Combination Platter: red beans & rice, jambalaya, shrimp creole, potato salad, turnip greens. He didn't seem too impressed.

Confusing. \n\nOverall, the night was lovely as we got to start celebrating K&J - but the food was distinctly subpar and as much as I appreciate being made to feel like a burden on those around me, the service left something to be desired.\n\nSampled the fried oysters, fried shrimp, red beans/rice, and was w friends who hit the fried chicken, jambalaya, turkey sandos, and ham - overall, the oysters were a bit soggy and metallic for my taste - the shrimp equally unappetizing - and the salad was #basic at its finest - underripe tomatoes, soggy greens, and shattered dreams - but I think ppl found the fried chicken decent. The ham, surprisingly, went largely uncommented upon, leaving me to assume that it was not the celebration of the pig that anyone imagined.\n\nThe best thing were these random chocolate chip cookies that I began housing once I realized that the actual entrees were not going to bring it home - but the bread pudding w bourbon sauce I sampled was only moderately respectable, though certainly pales in comparison to the Ritz's chocolate croissant bread pudding of my dreams.\n\nIf you're a paying customer, po'boys are $6.5-14 (turkey, sausage, shrimp, oyster, catfish, calamari), plates are $13-16 (etouffee, shrimp creole, fried chicken, ham dinner, jambalaya, etc), and other mains are around the same.

In spite of it's longstanding ties with the city, Mother's is not without a certain amount of controversy.  I had a couple of strong recommendations to go there from some friends and co-workers back in Seattle, but I had quite a few locals that I had met that told me not to bother going there.  In Mother's defense none of the no votes said anything disparaging about the food.  No, those complaints were more focused on the fact that Mother's had become such a tourist destination and, therefore, was very crowded. They do have a point.  You'd do well to get here well before noon.  Lunch is incredibly busy and seating is limited.  If the weather's nice, you might want to considering ordering to go and maybe scoring a park bench at the nearby Lafayette Square. That of course depends on what you're ordering.  My first time here I ordered the Roast Beef Po' Boy with Debris and that wasn't going anywhere, but to the nearest table.\n\nThey use the standard, light and airy, Italian roll for their Po' Boys at Mother's.  The bottom half of the split roll is slathered in classic American yellow mustard, which came as a surprise to me, but wasn't an unwelcome one. Then comes some coleslaw and that, in turn, is topped with sliced roast beef which then gets a healthy layer of debris and, finally, some gravy. The gravy is more jus than gravy, but it has a nice beefy flavor.  It's a huge sandwich.  They have a smaller version and I kind of regret not ordering it.  It's a good sandwich, too.  I wasn't blown away by it, the roast beef was a bit dry, but I ate the whole damn thing.  So, that tells you something.  In turns out that the debris is the best part of the sandwich. It's tender and full of flavor.  It's also available as an addition to almost any sandwich on their menu.  Which is pretty smart. The next time I'm here I'm getting The Ferdi Special which is basically the same sandwich that I had, but with sliced ham instead of sliced roast beef.  Seems like a winning combo to me!", "date": "2015-05-09 23:06:36"}

I would've waited anyway and I will recommend you to wait as well that's how good this place was. Oh and I ordered The Famous Ferdis special. Thank you Mothers you're one of the reasons why I will be back to NOLA", "date": "2015-05-26 08:43:08"}

The lines to get in are insane and the service is terrible! They have signs posted everywhere that say the employees cannot accept tips but it didn't matter because their attitudes don't warrant one. So we ordered a shrimp/oyster and soft crab shell Po Boy, fries and 2 drinks $50 bucks! Now if the food were good I wouldn't complain but it's nothing special. It's 3 or 4 small fried shrimp and 2 or 3 oysters with a little bit of dry slaw and a pickle chip on a plain, dry white French bread!? It's a six inch sandwich for $17.50! It was flavorless and blah! The soft crab she'll Po Boy was just bad! The entire crab is deep fried and put on the sandwich, shell and all. There was hardly any meat in my sandwich it was mostly shell!? The fries weren't even hot and to top it off zero customer service. But with lines out the door they assume they don't even have to try. Lastly they didn't they mention that for just a dollar more I could have gotten a 12 inch sandwich? At least I could have split a sandwich and saved myself $16.50 off the bill. So in my opinion SKIP this place as you won't be missing anything. So many better places to go eat in NOLA.", "date": "2015-05-26 19:37:12"}

His food was not good at all. Fried catfish had no seasoning, not even salt. The red beans had no seasoning except for a smoky flavor. They were terrible! Beans need more than just smoke! The ham (which they are famous for) was ok, nothing spectacular. I finally get my food. It was the calamari, again no seasoning. I drowned a few pieces in ketchup and hot sauce just cause I was sooo hungry and just needed food in my body.

It almost tasted like roasted duck to me.  The regular ham doesn't have that outside \"crust\" part.  Debris tasted like pot roast or beef stew to me as it was shredded meat in a sauce.

There were so many signs once you got to instruct you on what to do, where to stand, how to order, no tipping, check your order. The waitstaff was not exactly the friendliest around either. My wife and I had the Turkey Ferdi and grilled chicken Po' Boys with the white bean soup and red beans and rice. The food came rather quick despite the mass amount of customers. Except they brought me a shrimp po boy instead, which I dont mind shrimp, but a shrimp po boy just didnt seem appetizing. The waitress took it back. So while we waited, my wife ate her sandwich and gave me some. The turkey ferdi was soft and tasty with the au jus. The red beans and rice had all the right flavors and was the best ive ever had. So after we waited another 20 minutes, while our hostess finished her ssndwich, she came back and said, \"oh, let me check on your chicken....\" Once the sandwich came I was still blown away with how amazing it tasted. The chicken was grilled to perfection and the standard fixin's just added to make the best po boy ever. The only thing I am sour about now is the $4.50 proce difference between shrimp and chicken. Oh well...on the way out I saw another sign at the register that said to check our receipt before leaving the register.... i guess they screw up often.

It included a hotel stay at the Windsor Court Hotel blah blah blah...AND, a gift certificate to MOTHER'S Restaurant.   Finally! I was going to eat at Mother's, and for Free!  \n\nO-M-G! Thank God I didn't have to pay for that crap.  I ordered a Shrimp PoBoy, some potato salad, and whatever else that left no impression on me.  Completely OVERRATED.  \n\nTo all those people who waited to give their money to Mother's, I bet ya'll feel like suckas.  HAHAHA.  A short 10 minute walk away on Chartres, there's a lil shop called Johnny's.  That is the place to go.", "date": "2015-07-23 04:22:01"}

The fact that Mother's has been open for over 50 years and has the most reviews in New Orleans meant we had to try it as some point. Homey atmosphere.  We ate at 6pm on a Tuesday and there was not a long line.  Service was subpar.  The waitress made a point to tell us twice in a very loud voice so the entire room could hear that though there is a sign about tipping not required, the sign has been hung since the place was opened and tips were gladly welcomed.  Rude, inattentive service from start to finish. Rude cashier, rude water filler, rude waitress.  Thank you yelpers for letting us know that in advance - so we weren't upset about it at all.\n\nWe tried a lot of items.  Ralph (its the Ferdi (ham and beef) plus Swiss) regular po boy - it was adequate - a far cry from Parkway - two small portions, 5 inches each. Fried shrimp - tasty. Fries - large portion, thinly cut, fried well.  Shrimp Etouffee - did not taste fresh.  Red beans - over cooked, under seasoned. Shrimp Creole - over cooked, under seasoned.

Beyond sub par food. We were told we HAD to try the breakfast here and were unquestionably disappointed. We came on a Wednesday morning and waited 30 minutes in line JUST to order. The line stretched down the hall and to the front door. I was trying to find a a table for my family of five and I. The only table available in the front room was a four-seated table, I glanced in the back and it seemed to be completely full. So, like a normal person would, I grabbed one of the extra chairs stacked in the corner and added it to the four-sided table. As soon as I sat down to hold our table while the rest ordered, one of the \"managers\" immediately grabbed the chair from the table and yelled \"YOU CAN'T DO THAT! This table is for FOUR PEOPLE ONLY, NOT FIVE! I have plenty of tables in the back that you can use\" and walked away. I was taken back. I could not believe how stupid I was made to feel. We decided to wait in line anyway. Every two seconds, a server would break the line by pushing (and I mean PUSHING) their way through while screaming \"Out of my way!\" or \"Hot plate!\" (one which missed my face by a centimeter). We put in our orders and proceeded to find a table while juggling our drinks in hand. Went to the back room and the \"plenty of tables\" that were promised were all unavailable.We found a back-back room with tables but the door was slightly closed and a few employees were sitting at a messy table all on their phones. We asked a server if we could use one of these tables and she spat \" HOW MANY YOU HAVE?\". We replied five and she aimlessly looked around the room, rolled her eyes, and threw napkins and forks on an empty table right next to the \"break room\" table. We sat down and in comes a few employees screaming \"HEY HOE\" \"WHATS UP B*TCHES\" to the workers on their break. There was another family right next to us with children as well. Lovely. \nWe waited another 30 minutes after we sat down for our food to come. I ordered the breakfast special. Their \"famous ham\" was could, and cut VERY thickly. Th eggs were mediocre and required lots of salt and pepper. Grits were disgusting, crusty, and poured all over the eggs, The biscuits id not arrive to our table until 10 minutes after we received our meal.

She finally comes back and pretty much stares us down while she waits for someone to fix whatever is going on without ever letting us knowing what is going on. While we are waiting the people behind the counter are cursing at one another and being extremely disrespectful towards one another. Speaking about each other's children? All of this is in front of customers! Extremely unprofessional.

If you can swing it, go at an off-time. I went at 5 pm and there were plenty of tables and no line. Twenty minutes later, there were 15 people in line. Everyone I interacted with was very nice.\n\nEnter from the door facing Poydras. Pick up a menu to your right. (It helps to look at the menu online beforehand.) When ready, go the the cash register (or get in line) to order and pay. Cash or cards.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken with red beans and rice and fries as my two sides. They warn you that the fried chicken takes 30 minutes, but since I went early, it took 20 minutes. I also got a roast beef po'boy.\n\nI was not surprised or upset the po'boy was sitting in its juice, as another reviewer was. I've had similar presentations elsewhere. If this bothers you, ask to have the juice in a cup. The beef was moist and plentiful. Next time I would first pull off the top and distribute the toppings/condiments a little more evenly before snarfing down.\n\nIf you get fried chicken, remember it just came out of the fryer, so it's going to be really hot! (Duh.) I was really hungry and reason went out the window and I didn't take that into consideration. But it was good - crispy-coated, juicy inside,  and seasoned well. At other soul food places I've been disappointed by bland, unseasoned fried chicken.\n\nThe fries were fine. The mild red beans and rice were a bit weak. They lacked flavor (and I don't mean spiciness). There was a large biscuit rounding out the fried chicken dinner. Not a cat's head, but still good-sized.\n\nWhen you're done, head out the door opposite to where you came in from, at the corner of Poydras and Tchoupitoulas. The line was getting longer as I was leaving, and things were getting tense. The greeter kept asking the people in line to queue up a certain way so both they and staff remained safe.

It's a little confusing as to what to do when you get in because they give you menus but they say it's cafeteria style. Kind of oxymoronic. \n\nMy most recent visit was the day after thanksgiving. When we arrived we wanted an ATM so that we could get cash out to tip the server but the man at the door told us not to worry about that because they pay the staff minimum wage or higher so that customers don't have to worry about getting cash to tip. He stated that there are signs that say do not leave a tip. Ok then... We ordered our food and went to find a table. The cashiers make you feel very rushed and I wasn't pleased with that. The wait wasn't long at all and there weren't many people in the restaurant. There were a lot of tables dirty so we found one that was slightly clean. The server comes over to us and I told him that the table wasn't  clean. He leaves and returns with a cloth and cleans it. He never says one word to us. He then brings us our food, still never saying one word to us. Later, he puts our receipt on the table and still says nothing. As we get up to leave, the sever comes over and starts huffing and puffing and says that we didn't leave him a tip. As sorry as his service was, even if I had cash I wouldn't have left him a dime of my hard earned money. \n\nWe went to the front and talked to the man at the door about it and he just shook his head and said not to worry. I'm pretty sure the server gets complaints regularly because I can't see him just having a bad day to this extent. \n\nUnfortunately we probably won't go back.

After a 30 minute wait in line, we had to wait another 45 minutes for our food to come out. And what did we order? The Ferdi Special and Seafood Gumbo. I still don't understand why it took 45 minutes to prepare a sandwich and Gumbo, especially when the food was most likely prepared ahead of time to accommodate the huge horde of people that arrive at the restaurant every day.\n\nThe taste of the food itself was pretty good. I really enjoyed the Gumbo, but I felt that the Ferdi Special was a little bland. I didn't realize that it was straight up just bread and A LOT of meat. I'm sure that that sounds like the perfect sandwich for some people, but it wasn't all that impressive to me. So if you're not a huge fan of meat, then I would maybe try one of their seafood po-boys or other dishes.", "date": "2015-12-24 02:22:19"}

So I decided on chicken strips. I go to order and the man rudely announces \"you can't order that. Unless you're under 12.\" So you're saying that what food I want nap depends upon my age? So I tried ordering simply a side of red beans and rice because I had already waited long enough instead of leaving and going somewhere else. I sit down at a table and a man comes up to me, no hello, no how can I help you, he states \"give me your receipt\" to check that I in fact ordered food. You have to double check to see that I am allowed to sit in this building, I clearly had a drink in front of me. He left me alone after I showed him proof that I ordered food. As I sat alone, the old man at the table near me looked at his food and said \"this looks the road kill.\" He took one bite and left the restaurant. I sat there for 30 minutes. For a small side of red beans and rice it took 30 minutes. When the waitress came up to me with my food, she barked for my receipt. Again? And then took my receipt and I never saw it again. \n\nSo overall, the food was okay. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't horrible.

By \"it\" I mean the hype over Mother's Restaurant. It wasn't originally on our list of places to see, but our airport shuttle driver spoke such high regards for Mother's saying it was the best New Orleans has to offer. So after checking in to our hotel, we walked over to Mother's and there was a huge crowd outside the door! We fell in line behind a super nice couple that told us that anytime they visit New Orleans, they make a point to stop at Mother's for a meal. They raaaaaved about the red beans and rice side and the po boys. We finally made it to the front of the line and was escorted into the restaurant. There were a ton of empty tables/seats and you order your food at the register and it's brought to you. The line falls right next to the food that they're preparing which you'd think would help with getting excited for the meal to come, but it was not an appetizing scene whatsoever. The kitchen area was filthy and the food looked like it had been sitting there for awhile. I tried to forget what it looked like when we made it to the front of the line. I ordered the fried catfish, shrimp and red beans and rice. My boyf ordered the Debris po boy. After giving your order, you seat yourself wherever you'd like in the restaurant. The space was huge! Unfortunately, it was also very dirty. The floors looked like only children had been eating there (so much food spilled/wasted) and the chairs/tables were the same. There were bussers/the same people who brought our food to us. Don't forget to order your condiments or any other special requests at the register because the staff who brings you your food are not waitresses by any means. If you forgot to order something (in my case, I forgot to mention I'd like tarter sauce), you had to fall in line again. The food finally came out and I ate my meal atop a dirty table and sat on a chair that wobbled (uneven floors). The fried catfish and shrimp were heavily breaded. Granted, the fish and shrimp tasted very fresh and the breading was decent. The biggest disappointment was the sought-after red beans and rice. The rice was hard, the beans were incredibly soupy and it just felt like I was drinking the side dish. I had about 2 bites before I quit. It was not edible. K's Debris po boy was soggy on the bottom, making it difficult to enjoy. However, the meat was seasoned/marinated really well. Beware the pickles! SO MANY PICKLES on this sammy. (This may or may not have contributed to the sogginess). He got the regular sandwich, the small would have sufficed. Customer service was non-existent because I literally only spoke to the lady who took my order and my money. A rough start to an otherwise great vacation in New Orleans. Luckily there were many other restaurants and meals where I had an absolutely enjoyable time dining!", "date": "2016-01-04 22:22:20"}

It's the seafood platter.  The fried oysters, shrimp and tilapia were piled high on a plate.  It was crunchy, juicy and tender within the batter and addicting.  If you're unsure about it just ask if you can try a fried shrimp and you'll instantly be hooked, as in my situation.  There seemed to be a lot of locals here when we first came for lunch.  We walked in and wasn't sure if we needed to seated by someone, but after seeing people who came in after us walk up to the counter towards the end of the room, we realized that's where you order.  There are menus right by the door, which is why we thought someone would seat us, so it was a little confusing.  The menu is extensive and they have daily specials.  I wanted to try the Debris Po' Boy after hearing about it from the Travel Channel.  It's a roast beef sandwich on a baguette with mayo, mustard and shredded lettuce.  The au jus purposely soaks up the bottom bun and will run all over your plate and hands.  It's a messy one.  It's a good sandwich, but I didn't like it as much as the seafood here.  It's also very large, so the half size is good enough for one person.  We also had a side of red beans and rice, which was solid.  \n\nWhen we came here a second time during dinner the place was crazy packed, and there was a wait for a table.  Though the place is big with three different dining rooms, it felt crowded with so many people sitting around.  And because the place was so busy the dining areas were dirty, with food all over the floors and dirty dishes stacked high in containers around the dining area.  The bathroom was filthy.  I'd give this place 3 stars for its cleanliness, but the food is homemade goodness thus the bump up.", "date": "2016-01-07 02:45:12"}

They didn't do that. \n\nThe prices at this place are ridiculous. The inside was filthy. Food all over the place on the floor.

We decided on the chicken dinner/special and the Famous Ferdi, grabbed our waters and sat down. The chicken was delicious and the sides (green beans, rice & beans) complemented it well.

I felt like getting up to sit with them so they wouldn't have to move. \n\nOverall, very rude service. My money will never be spent here. No food is worth horrible service, especially in a place like New Orleans, where you can find plenty of great food with great service.", "date": "2016-02-16 01:49:14"}

The worker kept repeating the price louder and louder as my sister asked for water, and the worker finally said, \"they will give it to you at the table.\" The attitude of the worker was unnecessary.

During weekends, there is usually a relatively long line to get into the restaurant, but the line [usually] goes quickly. The first dish I tried here was their seafood gumbo, and it turned out to be my favorite dish in the whole restaurant. Their gumbo is AWESOME! I also have tried their fried chicken (which was served with a biscuit, mashed potatoes, and french fries), as well as their jambalaya---and they were both also delicious.\n\nThe only reason I do not give this place a 5/5 is because I wish the portions were larger than they actually are. Even when ordering a \"large\" size of a dish, I do not feel it's enough to call it a meal on its own.I do not eat a lot and it does not take a lot to get me full, but at this restaurant, I feel less-than-satisfied with the amount of food served in a single dish since I do not feel \"stuffed\". As a result, I usually end up either sharing another dish with a friend/family member, ordering a side dish, or getting a big dessert (either at the restaurant, or at another place in NOLA).\n\nThe ambience of this restaurant can be described as \"busy, crowded, and relatively loud\". During my few visits at Mother's, people were constantly walking around looking for a table in a not-so-spacious restaurant (since it is self-seating). Plenty of workers were also walking around cleaning tables and/or giving utensils to customers.\n\nLastly, I was always told that their baked ham is amazing (and is deemed the \"world's best\"), but I have yet to try it. I was also told by locals that this place is quite \"touristy\", so if one wants to try authentic \"Louisiana home-cooking\", one should eat elsewhere.", "date": "2016-05-19 03:06:43"}

Not much flavor, although the shrimp was the only hot thing on our plate.  The ham was luke warm, and although had a good flavor, was somewhat dry.  The gumbo was also just barely warm, but moreover, I make better gumbo than they do, and I'm not from Louisiana.  Butter, flour, time to brown the roux, onions, bell pepper, white wine, thyme, good sausage, chicken, Worcestershire sauce, good stock -- it's not that hard.  We paid $37 for really about $20 in value worth of food -- a French bread roll (50 cents wholesale)' 8 ounces of medium shrimp ($2.50 at best ), 15 cents worth of cabbage, pickles and mayo, a cup of gumbo that probably had 5 ounces of chicken and sausage  (cost about $1.50,) and a dollar cost for a serving of bread pudding..

I finally got her attention again and told her it was wrong, she admitted they were out of hot sausage (which they should have told me at the counter so I would have ordered the ham) I had to wait forever for a manager. When a manager came he reeked of alcohol and could not follow my story. I ended up just eating the smoked sausage. It was very disappointing. If you go, just order the baked ham or breakfast. And the sides-you can't go wrong! Have fun!", "date": "2016-05-28 17:59:49"}

The meat inside wasn't too flavorful, so I didn't think it deserved all the attention it got.\n\nAs for the sampler platter, out of all of the items on this plate, the only thing that was flavorful was the jambalaya.  Now that, I could eat all day.  I kind of wish we had gotten a plate full of that instead.  The crawfish etoufee and red beans and rice were actually really lacking in flavor.

At our table, we tried the red beans, the crawfish etouffee, the shrimp loaf and a salad. The poboy was the best thing on the table but really just wasn't all that special, lots of shrimp, but nothing really jumps out at you about it. The beans might have been right out of the Blue Runner can and the etouffee was bland (not just mild...the flavor just wasn't the savory goodness you come to expect). The service was good and the place has a ton of seating, but if you only have a few days in town, head to Mandina's on Canal for your gumbo and shrimp poboy fix. If you need a second poboy, short stop for roast beef debris. If you get a third meal (lucky you), then you've got a ton of options, Mother's just isn't one of them.", "date": "2016-06-10 09:21:07"}

I'm no Cajun but my 12 year old cooks better etoufee. \"Ferdi Special\" po' boy? I've had better hoagies from a gas station refrigerator. Seafood gumbo? Don't waste your time. Literally there was no light at the end of the tunnel. After spending 20 minutes to find parking, on a Tuesday, I wanted our meal to be over after I took the first bite. What's with the whole order at a cash register and we'll bring it out to you business? I literally didn't even finish my words before the \"attendant\" ( and I use that word very loosely) was saying \"next\". What an awful experience. Don't waste your time or money! Can we give negative stars because this place deserves no less!!!!!!", "date": "2016-07-15 04:44:59"}

A lot of these places saw some damage, and kept it up the best they could without totally changing it. So here's my review:\n\nGood food. Fun place. Crowded, but not when we went. Yes we had to wait but it was maybe 30 minutes outside before we went inside. The officer helping with the door was really nice and told us some stories while we were waiting. \n\nYou go inside and wait some more, again, not long. The managers hand out menus while you're outside so you have a chance to look and are ready to order when you get in. Staff is there to hep cut you off between the kitchen line doorway and the counter so cooks can come through with more food. Not one person was rude to me there. \n\nI ordered our food, mine the combination with crawfish etouffe and my husband's the seafood platter. A bit pricey but hats to be expected when you're ordering nothing but seafood. \n\nBoth meals were delicious. I liked the jambalaya, the red beans and rice, and etouffe, my potato salad, and my cabbage. My husband's fried catfish and oysters were really good, too.\n\nServer wasn't around much but it was busy. They had 3 dining rooms for Pete's sake! But everyone helped on another out and we had multiple people ask us if we were okay.\n\nIt was good food and it was worth going to so that I can say that I went. I would easily come back if I'm here again.", "date": "2016-07-16 11:56:41"}

I just think it's really rude and unprofessional. You get a receipt and go sit down. The dinning room server comes and checks your ticket. We both got 1/4 fried chicken, i got green beans and fries and my fianc\u00e9 got red beans and rice and greens for our sides. Our food took about 15-20 minutes because they fry the chicken as it's ordered. I was really impressed with the food. The chicken was fantastic and wasn't greasy at all. The sides were awesome, the green beans came in like a chutney, my finance's red beans and rice were great and the greens were perfect!! The greens weren't bitter at all like when they aren't cooked right and had big pieces of fat back bacon in them, they were so good. It also came with a biscuit and grape jelly which was good. I'm from the south and not everybody can do biscuits but it was really good. Our server worked her butt off, it got really busy right after we got there and she was working, but always checked on us and made sure we were taken care of. \n\nThere is a sign in the dinning room that said that employees aren't allowed to accept tips, but that is not true. We asked because we felt like she deserved it and were told that they are allowed to accept tips. We tipped our server because she was working.. \n\nFood is overall great just a bad front counter experience. Price wise it is great too. I think for all that food we paid maybe $30 or less.

That's how I feel about this place.\n\nMother's came highly recommended, based off the fact that it was apparently featured on a Travel Channel food show of some sort.  And let me just say...why?\n\nRant begin:\n\nSo I don't mind the line.  The line is not an issue.  Some people may think that a line guarantees quality, but having lived around the LA food scene I can very much guarantee you it does not.  But as lines go, this wasn't a long wait, even if it looks like one.\n\nI don't mind that service was a little weird.  Now no one working here seemed like bad people, but it's a definite culture shock coming from California where service is apparently super friendly and then in NOLA it's just sort of \"I'll help you, but I don't have to like it\".  Nothing for me to get angry at, just a bit of a shift.  But that's still not the problem.\n\nThe problem was the Ferdi Special.  I'm going to be here possibly once in my life, I'm going to go for the Ferdi Special because it's at the top of the menu and it is a specialty of Mother's.  Therefore, this is them saying \"This is our best effort, enjoy\".  And...\n\nWho in their right mind looked at \"Au Jus\" and seriously thought \"Hey, you know that runny, wet sauce people like to dip roast beef sandwiches into?  Hear me out, let's puddle it onto the bottom of the plate and let the sandwich just sit in it.  Just let it swim in those juices.  Just let that bread soak it all in and disintegrate before your very eyes.  Because that's what sandwiches were made for.  They were made so you can't pick them up.\"  Like I'm all for open faced but sandwiches are literally made to be eaten with hands what is this?!  It's a mess.  It's a mess of salty meat.  Was it good?  No.  Not even close.  I came in wanting a nice hot meal and I get half of a sandwich and it's not very good.  And just so I'm clear, this wasn't a bit of soggy bread.  This bread was full on paste by the time it got to me.  You CAN'T pick it up, it just crumbles into goop.\n\nAnd part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt and say \"Well maybe they have good gumbo or something\" but this was the specialty at the top of the menu!  If I went to an actual mother's house and said \"Cook me your specialty\" and they're all \"Okay, let me make you some delicious meatloaf\" and the meatloaf comes out and it's made of paper towels and used syringes you don't get a chance to offer me some soup.  You had your shot and squandered it.\n\nI give them two stars because there is still care and hope for this business and obviously someone must like it, and the food wasn't inedible I suppose.  But the Ferdi Special is not the way to go.  Some other reviews might disagree, but they lie.  That's right, I'm calling you out.  You know you're valid opinion?  It's wrong.  You have a wrong opinion.  and your favorite movie isn't very good either.  I'm feeling salty.  It's probably from all the salty meat.", "date": "2016-08-01 22:35:06"}

There were about 6 people behind the food counter. And what was concerning was no employee handling the food had a hair net on or gloves! Also they were cleaning for the night and spraying cleaning spray right near to the open food. I was nervous for my food to be brought to the table and for a reason. I received my plate from the waiter and the first thing I noticed immediately was a thick black curly hair on my ham. I tried not to get sick and told the waiter about the hair. He picked up my plate very rudely and said nothing no apology or anything. He went back and seemed to yell at the workers behind the food counter. A few seconds later a new plate had arrived. But by then it was too late my appetite was complete gone and along with my money since this place makes you pay before you get the food. I do not recommend this place at all.

We went here for lunch not really knowing what to expect, and we did arrive before 11:30 before the locals began to pile in for lunch. Just a tip to avoid long lines--go early or go late for lunch, but avoid the noon hour. Now, I will also say everyone was very friendly. We didn't know what to order, but the regulars steered us to the combination plate. It was outstanding. We had jambalaya, red beans and rice, out-of-this world potato salad and turnip greens.

You go through the line, pass the counter, but don't order to the register, slightly congested and unorganized but don't stress. Once you order, just find a random place to sit, someone will come by and be your food runner. Main complaint is that there is no order to that because I noticed others got the same food as us, before us, who ordered after us, if that makes any sense.The runner / bus person was so nice and friendly though.\n\nOk on to the food, we ate a few hours before but still wanted to try something else. Got the famous sandwich, the ferdi? Debris? Whatever it's called, it's really good. Just a bunch of meat with some great bread. Also has that moisture kind of like a beef au jus sandwich and a beef sandwich from Chicago. A full size is good to share between two people.\n\nAlso tried a bowl of the shrimp creole. Which had a hardy portion of shrimp. I don't think I've ever had. But kind of tasted like Cajun and Mexican tortilla soup combined.\n\nI think together, the meal was around $22 or so.

The grits were also good. The Gumbo was out of this world. Tender pieces of shrimp and oysters in a seasoned brown sauce, should I be saying roux? White rice was served on the side to mix into the Gumbo God it was good. All that was around $22.00.  The girl who took our order at the register was nice. She called everyone honey or baby.

And while the chicken was crispy and fried well, it didn't have much flavor to it. I had to keep asking for condiments...something...ANYTHING to put on this dry hot mess but nothing really helped. \n\nThe red beans and rice were okay, but JUST okay. The whole dish was very meaty, almost too meaty and it was missing....something as well. Honestly I expected more taste, more robust flavors, maybe some garlic, some spices, etc, I don't know. \n\nThe next time I went I ordered a ferdi po'boy which came with ham, roast beef and au jus (with some kind of meat in it) and that sandwich was  on par with the last. The bread was ok and the meat was tender but bland. Once again, everything about this sanwich was dry but  I figured hey, maybe that's intentional. So I added some au jus....which only then made it soggy and difficult to eat. The meat in the au jus tasted funny btw, not \"funny\" as in off or spoiled but just....not very good. \n\n I went in expecting some kind of religious experience so maybe I set myself up for failure but I really wish I could have had the food adventure I was promised; but alas, I did not.

It's basically a giant sandwich stuffed with ham and roast beef marinated with their homemade gravy. Let's just say it's a hot mess in a good and delicious way. It also comes in in regular and small sizes, but there's actually no difference because the small looks just as big as the regular and the regular is only a buck more.

My husband went up to order and I was going to sit at a table, I was told I couldn't sit down until I ordered?! So I ordered catfish and potato salad and green beans with tomatoes. My husband and daughter ordered fried shrimp and fries and my son ordered a shrimp and oyster po boy and two sodas and two waters, the order came up to 70.00! We were told the soda machine was out of co 2 so they would bring the soda over to us. So we sat down after we ordered and the waiter took our receipt. The food came and it was bland and small portions. My green beans were like soup and the tomatoes tasted like acid. My husband had to go back up and get the soda and they acted like he was lying about them telling him the co 2 was out. For 70 dollars this was the worst and MOST EXPENSIVE meal we had in New Orleans. And it's cafeteria style food sitting under warming lights in the kitchen.

The restaurant was packed for a Friday morning. We had to wait outside the door for a few minutes before the line inside moved enough for us to come in.\n\nOrdering is cafeteria style. You pass the containers of food and line of workers assembling orders through sneeze guards before hitting the register, ordering your food, and paying. If you ordered a drink, you wait right next to the register for those drinks to be given to you. We decided on the Ferdi Special & a bowl of jambalaya for myself. All this costs a little over $20, which is a great deal. If you visit when it is busy (which it will almost most likely be), may the odds be in your favor when looking for a table. They are almost always taken immediately after a group leaves.\n\nWorkers walk around with orders looking at your receipt to match the right table. I would think there would be a more efficient way of handling this to save errors from happening. We were given an extra piece of bread pudding we never ordered. Not complaining though! It was delicious.\n\nFood was given in great portions, just like in the rest of New Orleans. However, I was very underwhelmed at the quality. The debris po'boy was very plain from the few bites I had tried and I thought my jambalaya was a little too salty. However, with the amount of food we were served, I didn't mind. My boyfriend, who usually could eat a horse and still have room for dessert, could barely stomach half the sandwich. This was a very big plus. However, we decided not to take the leftovers with us for a later meal because of the sheer amount of sodium we had lingering in our dry mouths.\n\nIf you are a neat freak like me, I suggest you try your hardest not to look down by the containers of food and on the floor. I had a very hard time not grimacing at the amount of grime, grease, and dirt in the restaurant. Then again, it's the food that matters, right?\n\nHonestly, I would not come again. The restaurant was in dire need of a deep cleaning, food was underwhelming, and service was lacking (not including a couple amazing waitresses that served us).

Opted for the Ferdi, a house specialty po boy layered with their famous baked ham, roast beef, debris and a heavy ladle of gravy. I mean, I guess it was fine -\u00a0a regular is definitely a hearty meal - but I wasn't bowled over by the meats, the bread desperately needed a good saturatin' by the beef drippings, and the whole shebang (sand sides) rang in at $13. Bloody Mary in an 8oz plastic cup tipped this kinda just okay meal over $21, and I know I could have spent the same for better.\n\nShe was completely unimpressed with their three stack of pancakes. One of the two questions I asked: \"can she get a side of bacon with her 'cakes?\" You'd think I ran over her dog. \"We do NOT serve bacon.\"\n\n** If you learn nothing else, learn this: Mother's does not serve bacon. That is all. **\n\nOkay, not all. We went sausage instead and I actually preferred the house-made links to anything else on the menu.\n\nThe last and most peculiar point: you order at a counter, a server brings you the food. There are signs everywhere that says \"We at Mother's do not accept gratuities.\" There's a story about it in the menu. So you can imagine how squirmy we got when our server mentioned said signs, and said, \"While it's the restaurants tradition, we do actually accept tips.\" Well, this is fucking awkward.\n\nThree stars because nothing was outright bad, it was just a mediocre meal.

However, that's where the positives end... the sandwich was soaked in au jus, and impossible to eat without a fork & knife. The sandwich came with slaw, mustard & pickles. I'm not a big mustard fan (& missed this in my hasty order), and the I think I make better flavored, shredded beef at home. The fries were slightly warm, but I was hungry so I kept eating both.\nDespite the NO tradition, I would definitely not recommend this place.", "date": "2017-04-13 02:23:28"}

One hour and 30 min later and guess what, Fried Chicken (wait for it) no seasoning at all very bland, side of greens and red beans and rice. Unless I missed something Mothers has not one thing pleasurable for me except the wonderful waiter who was not our waiter who served us. Thank god there was no tipping allowed.

The Ferdi comes with a big container of debris (shredded beef in au jus drippings) to spread on your sandwich.  At first, my father thought they threw in some beef stew, but no, that was the debris in a soup bowl container. The sandwich is served with creole mustard mayonnaise (creonnaise?) which really added some great flavor.  \n\nWe also ordered seafood gumbo (eh according to my dad) and fried chicken (thumbs up from my mom).  The fried chicken was tasty but not spicy.  It also came with two sides and a yummy biscuit.  I just wish they had served the biscuits with honey and butter.", "date": "2017-05-01 01:45:35"}

When you talk to any person who's lived in the Big Easy and ask them where you should eat, 9/10 of them will most likely recommend Mother's. Mother's is an all-day restaurant that's been around here in NOLA for a very long time. People will come here as early as 7am when it opens for breakfast, until as late as 10 pm when it closes for a last minute dinner. \n\nSince Mother's was hyped so heavily by my coworkers, I decided to venture out to this place and make it my first taste of \"real\" Southern food. Mother's is located on Poydras Street and only about a 5-10 minute walk from Canal Street. And so it's super convenient to get to if you are staying at one of the major hotels downtown. \n\nWhen I got there around 7pm on a Wednesday, the place was pretty packed. My coworker told me it was like cafeteria style food, and it kind of seemed like it. The food was found in little bins near the kitchen and the layout of the restaurant felt like a cozy cafeteria. There's a few rooms inside, and so if you come in and feel like it's packed, you should be able to find a table. FYI just don't come at lunch unless you are willing to wait a LONG TIME.\n\nTo be honest, I was a bit embarrassed at first while ordering because I THOUGHT it was one of those places where you grab your food first and then pay (cafeteria) like my coworker suggested, but you actually just pay for your food and then find a seat. Luckily, the cashier was pretty welcoming and I ended up getting a Jambalaya plate for around $16 with a side of grits and red beans.\n\nMy food came out relatively quickly and I was served by a nice gentleman. And boy were the portions HUGE! If you are hungry, I really recommend Mama's because you'll be stuffed! In a nutshell, I thought that the jambalaya was definitely savory and tasty. There was a little sweet kick to it, and overall I enjoyed it. The sausages were okay, not too tender, but not too firm. Unfortunately, I wasn't a bit fan of the grits (tasted like plain porridge) and the red beans were okay. I thought the portion sizes were amazing, but I kind of wished that it was slightly cheaper. \n\nOverall, I had a decent experience at Mother's. The food wasn't that amazing, and I regret not ordering half and half with their famous gumbo because I felt like I was trying to force down the grits. Otherwise, portion size is a plus if you eat a lot and there's plenty of seating and there's a TV for entertainment! Just come at the right time and you'll be happy. Also, signs say don't tip, but I encourage you to tip because the server(s) are very kind. I give this place a \"tolerable, sufficient for sustenance\" rating!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "date": "2017-05-21 22:29:19"}

It's recommended for tourists, and I even had friends recommend this place to me.  It sounded like exactly what I would love - an old diner type place with delicious creole food. And a few blocks from my hotel and some of the sites I was seeing too!  Well, the old historical atmosphere is definitely there and I enjoyed sitting there, and the staff were all super nice, but I found the food much blander than I was expecting in terms of spice and flavour, and really not cheap - I ordered the combination plate, and it was $20.  With the bad CAD to USD exchange rate right now, back home, that would get me amazing food at all sorts of good places for lunch.  I ate it all (did not find the portions too huge in New orleans, like in other places in the US), so it wasn't bad, but nothing really exciting.  Good chunks of chicken in the jambalaya (one thing I wanted to try while in New Orleans) but was pretty plain.  I chose crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e (I think the other choice was shrimp creole, which I had tried already at The Gumbo Shop, which I didn't love there, but I did really enjoy the gumbo there).  For the side, I chose the green beans with tomato which was okay, but not really my thing since I'm used to green beans that are barely cooked (bright green/fresh tasting/slightly crisp), so I could have chosen a better side.  Was thrown off by it being called \"Jerry's\" as that usually means it's someone's special recipe, so I thought they would be more flavourful.  Red beans and rice were fine.  Potato salad was soft and creamy without a lot of texture, so I think it was good, but I really didn't like how all the other dishes were touching it on the plate.  Everything was all kind of luke warm (instead of potato salad being cold, and the other dishes being hot).  And it was all the same soft texture, which I realize is part of the style of the food, but all of the options for sides are all very soft, so no contrast available (and with a big combination plate, you're unlikely to want to order additional food).  Wish I had ordered a po' boy, but I was trying to order things that I wouldn't be able to get back home, and I can get and make pretty good sandwiches at home.  I had the sweet potato pie because I don't think I've ever had it before, and it was fine.  When I walked in, I didn't realize there was a huge room of tables so i sat in the same room where you order the food and it was fine, but you might want to check out the other side too when you are choosing where to sit.

The food and service were average with their signature cafeteria/diner style manner of service with a classic vibe. The line and wait for dinner\u200b at around 5pm was not too bad, but was to be expected based on other reviews and the general tourist appeal. In fact it seems the long lines and vintage look are what pull in the tourists. If people are waiting in that long line for food, then it must be good, right? \n\nI ordered the combination platter to get a sampling of a little of everything at Mother's. The generously sized platter included jambalaya, red beans and rice, potato\u200b salad, crawfish etouffee (or shrimp), and choice of one side (turnip greens). The jambalaya was tasty and on the sweeter side, but I prefer spicy. The red beans and rice were very bland and the sausage was lacking in texture/flavor, so it ended up being my least favorite. The potato salad might have been my favorite and was a welcomed surprise to try the mashed-style potato salad. I have never had crawfish etouffee before so it is hard to compare, but I enjoyed it and it was my second favorite item. The turnip greens were not too bad and had delicious chunks of ham in them. All of the food items seemed to lack in spice and were under-seasoned, but this was overwhelmingly overcorrected for by being a salt bomb to the face. \n\nTheir location is very central to a lot of the major hotels and the casino, which makes it prime real estate. It looks vintage, which it is, but also was a little dirty. The wait staff and the experience were nice, and I enjoyed my first visit.

I also drizzled a little lemon on it and it was amazing. Not too dry, not too wet.\n\nMy husband ordered the Ferdi Po' Boy with ham and roast beef. He really enjoyed the first half of his sandwich. Yes, I forgot to tell you that the Po' Boy is huge! You could really save the other half for later but it's so good why wait? Anyway, because his Po' Boy was dripping with their gravy sauce, the other half got soggy so he didn't enjoy eating soggy bread. We also ordered a side of their fries - also a huge serving. After we finished that, we got a bread pudding (a New Orleans staple) which was delicious! Perfect ending to our meal.\n\nAfter talking to people later on during our trip, many people told us we should try Gene's and other spots for Po' Boys, but honestly I'm fine with my experience and would recommend Mother's to anyone without hesitation.

The kids chicken strips are a must-try. They are on par and really good. The kids shrimp are only ok. My husband had their ham platter (I think) and that was very good. The ham was awesome, it was like dinner ham we'd have on a holiday. The mashed potatoes were also exceptional. My mother-in-law shared her sides with me: the green beans & tomatoes were awesome (I've never thought of that combination) and the steamed cabbage looked and tasted great.\n\nNow my actual order was their Debris PoBoy and a cup of the special of the day-a corn chowder. The Debris was not added to the order and the chowder never made it to the table-despite my paying $7 for it. Eventually I did get the Debris and it was ok. It was roast beef with coleslaw-nothing really special and very disappointing (especially after the screw-up and the wait).  I also got the Bread Pudding for dessert, and that my readers was by far the very best thing I had. If you go there, this is a must-have.  \n\nThe lady who was working the area for us was ok.

Even after waiting for the chicken we found it lacked seasoning.  \nThis place does not live up to the hype!\nWish we would have left and gone to Popeye's instead and not wasted 60 bucks and 2+ hours.", "date": "2017-07-15 18:26:34"}

So of course I had to hit one of the most talked about spots here. Last night after a long day of working with kids me and a friend accidentally ran into Mothers on our last night. It was on the list but we just honestly hit Bourbon and Frenchman street every night. We walked in about an hour before closing and the line was nice and short and it was a little stagnant. Of course being the most indecisive person ever I took about 10 min to decide what I wanted and by that time a family of like six showed up and the line got a lil thick but it still moved really quickly. My friend Kisha is all about asking people what is the best to get and Marvin and the sweet security guard we're really great about answering all of our questions. \n\nNow I'm not the biggest seafood fan but we decided to do a shrimp poboy, a chicken breast poboy and crawfish etoufee, yes we regret not getting the catfish one not because the chicken one was bad but because it's about the seafood. But everything was good. The crawfish etoufee has a nice consistency and flavor. The poboys were dry though. I needed some kind of remoulade or sauce because the tarter and cocktail doesn't cut it and if I put anymore hot sauce on that poboy I would melt a toilet. But I do also have to say I get it, New Orleans is a hard city but customer service is very important in the restaurant industry and I didn't feel any at the register and the food wasn't good enough for all the attitude.", "date": "2017-07-16 13:07:09"}

I think the 2 or 3 nights I got dinner from there, I waited probably like 15-20 min for my food. It might seem like a long time, but it wasn't all that bad.\n\nThe food there was pretty good as well. I got the Gumbo. Yeah, I probably should've branched out and tried some of their other dishes, but I'm a simple man. LOL. Maybe next time. haha. The Gumbo from Mother's Restaurant is so good, especially with the rice.

My first visit. It's not a fancy sit-down tablecloth place...it's like a fast-food place with a deli type ambience...you get a menu from the security guard as you enter...the line was reasonable at 7 pm which surprised me...it's obvious the lines could snake outside the door and spill out onto the street. But I arrived when there was only about 8 people ahead of me...score! When I left at about 9 pm, the line had formed.\n\nTIP: Don't scrutinize too carefully the food in the display counter as it's a sloppy mess....concentrate on what you will order...pay it...put your receipt on your table...and while you wait just a short while, look on the pics of military visitors and other conservative luminaries who have visited this place...don't judge, just enjoy when your food comes...\n\nFRIED CATFISH PLATE: Two large pieces of catfish filet...flakey inside and crunchy outside, with some drier bits....looked dry, but wasn't totally.  It wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst...and I was surprised it was flakey inside. I slathered hot sauce on it, so even though it didn't have much flavor...the hot sauce was awesome sauce. \n\nYou get to choose two sides:\n\nRED BEANS & RICE: Moist, chockablockful of chicken and sausage. I liked it.\n\nTURNIP GREENS: THE BEST YUMMIEST TURNIP GREENS EVER. My life was made perfect by these greens. If I could have stuck my nose in the small bowl, I would have. I even though about ordering more, but the long line scared me. I think my lovely waitress who brought me the food and returned the receipt to me might have been able to jump the line for me...I asked her to get me change for the tip, and she was able to do that much for me. \n\nPROS: Being in a NOLA institution. Lucky to find a short line. TURNIP GREENS, a must! It's got meat in it, by the way (tender chunks of pork)...*sigh* I wonder what it would be without the pork, but when in Rome. It was DELISH!!\n\nCONS:  Lines....but really it wasn't a problem for me. Although, if the lines had been shorter, I would have jumped back in and ordered their famous po boys to try...or some dessert. Perhaps if I had not gorged and ate it ALL, I would have asked my waitress...I should have asked her how to order to go without losing my table or getting back in line. Not much for vegans or vegetarians tho.\n\nOVERALL: Happy experience at Mothers!", "date": "2017-08-07 07:33:20"}

I was told this was a spot I that I needed to visit while in NO. I was told that the fried chicken and poboys were amazing. When you walk in, you are told to grab a menu and go to the cashier to place your order. As you make your way to the cashier, you pass the food line, it looked really bad (like messy and would make you question their food safety standards). There were three flies on the countertop above the food line staring us down.The atmosphere is not appetizing at all. My best advice is just don't look at the line and go straight to the cashier to order your food. There were two cashiers together, the lady who took our order made me feel like she didn't want to be bothered and was less than friendly. After paying for our food in advance, we navigated through the place to find an empty table. Someone came and took our ticket off the table and our food arrived about 30 minutes later ( kinda expected the wait because the menu said that's how long the chicken would take). No one asked for our drink order, we had to get up and flag someone down for water. When the food finally arrived, it was just average. Not bad, just ok. My shrimp and oyster poboy ($18) tasted like the one on the Popeyes menu. My cup of seafood gumbo ($7) tasted average. My husband rated his fried chicken a B+.  I wouldn't go back, I wouldn't recommend it to another person as a must visit location.  The food was average. I don't like the fact that the restaurant doesn't want you to tip the staff, I think that contributes to the poor quality of the service there.", "date": "2017-08-09 22:35:02"}

As you stand in line, you need to decide what you want, because once you arrive at the Cashier, you need to be ready to give your order.  The cashier does not waste any time taking your order, and moving you along for the next person.  Interestingly, all the workers, behind the counters, in the kitchen and serving, were older ladies which, to me, is great to see.  Once your food is ready, it is brought to your table (based on the number you were given), and then you eat.  Their breakfast consist of the usual selections, and they also have many of the typical Southern foods for lunch.  I ordered the Famous Ferdi Special, which is a plate of Ham, Roast Beef, the \"debris,\" and Au Jus gravy.  I was not aware of what \"debris\" was until it showed up on my plate, and I found out that it is just all the meat bits, fat, charred pieces, etc. that falls off the roast while it is cooking.  And It was quite delicious.  Definitely will be going back to visit Mother's if we ever get to visit NOLA in the future.  Enjoy!", "date": "2017-08-16 22:58:33"}

So much to say but not sure where to start...\n\nI think out of all the restaurants we had looked at on our trip I was the most excited for this one. So many people had recommended this place for the history and the food.\n\nThe lady they had at the door was very sweet and gave great direction. Be ready for the lines because they will be long which indicates the food is good, right?! \n\nThe line is where my opinions start changing. It's hot and you're packed in while everyone is looking at the menu. I stood next to my fianc\u00e9 but apparently I couldn't do that as there was no signage posted. I got a very inappropriate and extremely rude awakening as one of the older ladies LOUDLY exclaimed, \"Mama move out of the way. Take your big wide hips and squeeze in mama. Keep going keep going. Stay there this is my walkway.\" Now, I don't get offended easily and goodness gracious I'm a southern girl who likes food and I do have some hips on me but good Lord in heaven there is absolutely no reason to be unnecessarily RUDE. It made me VERY uncomfortable and the group behind us kept saying, \"Poor girl. That was mean.\" Yes, yes it was. I was squeezed in so tightly the first time she said something but she took it too far. Still extremely embarrassed we made our way to the cashier who was an amazing multi-tasker. She was great!\n\nWe found a table pretty easily and our waitress brought our drinks but just a heads up you will pay $2.75 for a teeny tiny drink that you will not get refilled the entire time you are there. Your waitress will be right next to you and...NOPE, will not acknowledge you.\n\nI would've given 2 stars but the food...The food was so dadgum good! I mean it almost made it all worth it. My shrimp po boy was huge and so flavorful and my side of potato salad was divine. My fianc\u00e9 got the combo platter and raved. \n\nIt's a shame that the experience was humiliating and some people never learned manners.

My boyfriend had the ham dinner. And mind you the tag line here is worlds best baked ham. But his were 3 chunks that were dry. He pretty much eats anything so he said it was fine. He also enjoyed his sides. But you can't really mess up French fries and he also had red beans and rice. I'm gonna chalk this up to the fact that we came in an hour before closing but for a place that has such a good name for itself I'm not sure if that should matter. The high light was the sweet potato pie that I ordered. Now that was delicious. It would have been perfect if they would have just warmed it up for about 15 seconds.

Always a huge line. But decided to go there for lunch while visiting New Orleans. And we arrived prior to lunch rush. \nGood things first- line was not too long but it moved pretty quickly. I got the special red beans and rice with a meat choice and 2 sides. My husband got the same. The price was reasonable. Food amounts generous. Turnip greens were yummy. French fries thin and crispy!  And the brownie was rich and fudgy!  All that was great stuff. \nNow for the not so good--the red beans and rice was pretty tasteless. Not spicy, not flavorful. I've made better from a box. I got the debris as my meat side. This is supposed to be beef pieces that is the leftovers from roast beef. It was basically shredded roast beef cooked in au jus. Again tasteless. Nothing AT ALL spectacular. Or worthy of a line. \nMy husband got fries, grits as his sides and chose the black ham as his meat choice. To clarify, they warn that the black ham (caramelized outer crust if baked ham) is in short supply and rarely available after 8 am. Upon ordering, he asked for black ham, they checked to see if any available, cook said yes. So happy times!  Got order, baked ham instead of black on plate. Apparently, cook mistaken. Hubby does not like baked ham. And this ham was again like the rest, tasteless. And dry. No moisture to be found. Surprised bc it's known as best baked ham in WORLD. ITS NOT. \nService- we saw the server three times. Once to pick up our receipt for order. Second to bring order. Third to bring the rest of our order bc she didn't bring it all the first time. No refills on drinks bc she never came back. Perhaps needed to do that ourselves but customers six people deep around drink area awaiting for to-go orders. \nEnd result-disappointing food and experience. Not worth the line. Or the cost. Maybe their seafood is better. But I'm not going to bother trying since what they are supposedly known for doesn't meet their own slogan.", "date": "2017-11-06 19:17:48"}

We did make it there and were sorely disappointed.  The service was fine for a cafeteria style place - we were handed menus by a non-smiling host at the door and directed to order at the cash first and then sit down.  After studying the menu for a while and beginning to feel like the cashier was losing patience, we decided to order a soft shell crab po'boy and a roast beef po'boy to split amongst the three of us. We decided against any sides.  We then sat down and waited for our food.  \n\nWhen it came, we were disappointed for a couple of reasons.  One was partly our fault - on the menu, the roast beef says it comes 'topped with debris'.  We didn't notice this when we ordered, so my mother thought she was getting just sliced roast beef on the sandwich.  There were a few slices of roast beef (maybe 3) that were pale grey in colour.  She was also turned off by the appearance of the debris - it's kind of like pulled pork but more as if someone has chewed it already.  This was our mistake, and my mother had a hard time eating it because of the appearance of the meat.  It was also not particularly flavourful, and the gravy made the bottom of the bun completely soggy.  Perhaps this is typical for po'boys, this was our first (and last) time ordering one in NOLA, so I'm not sure how 'typical' our sandwiches were relative to other restaurants.  My soft shell crab sandwich was ok - except it could more accurately be described as a 'lettuce, batter, and mayonnaise' sandwich on stale bread.  The soft shell crab was almost non-existent in the batter, although I did bite into a couple huge pieces of shell that I had to pull out of my mouth before I choked on them.  Again, it should be noted that this was my only experience with a po'boy whilst in NOLA so I have no comparison.  \n\nWe paid almost $30 for two 'small' sandwiches.

Everything is made in house (desserts, sausages, roasts, ham, etc) and with a full bar in the back room and giant tvs, its a great place to catch a game. Considering they've been there 80 years, you know they are doing something right.\nTheir are multiple dining rooms in this cavernous old historic building.\nTons of famous people align the walls. \nservice is cafeteria style. There are always lines here that move quickly. You'll get a menu while on line, order your food, get your drink and then find a table. Once seated a server will stop by to grab your receipt and bring you your food. Everything runs smooth, efficiently, and with a smile.\nI had their fried oyster \\shrimp po' boy served with shredded cabbage, sliced pickles, and mayo (you can ask for tartar or cocktail if you want).\nThis has to be one of my favorite sandwiches now. Had a small side of red beans and rice (mmm.Good!) and for dessert, a slab of their bread pudding with whiskey sauce (Amazing!)\nI also tried a piece of their special :  The Ferdi po' boy consisting of their famous baked ham, house made roast beef with debris au jus gravy.\nDEBRIS is the scrapings of all that good burnt meat at the bottom of the pan that some chefs \"deglaze\" with. It was very good, but didn't beat my po boy.\nTheir seafood gumbo with shrimp, crab, and oysters, in a delicate crab stock with okra and their house roux just slaps you in the face and says, \" You're in New Orleans now, so pay attention!\" One of the best gumbos I've ever had.\nBy the end of the meal I was in such a happy, comfort zone mood, I had to pass the kitchen and commend the cooks on duty.\nMother's also serves all types of breakfast items, multiple  types of po' boys and salads, as well as the classic jambalaya and etouffee, amoungst other dishes.\n-- THIS IS NEW ORLEANS and a visit here is a MUST when visiting this great city.", "date": "2017-12-27 21:39:52"}

(If there's a line, there's probably a reason). It moved more quickly than we thought, and we didn't have time to read the stories on the menu. So we kept it while we waited for our food. \nOnce you get your menu, you need to decide rather quickly what to get. Then you give your order and find a seat. Give your receipt to a server, and they will bring the food to you.\nMy wife ordered the fried chicken dinner, which is made to order. We were advised to wait 30 minutes, but it came around 20 minutes later. I got the shrimp po' boy and some gumbo. \nMy wife's chicken was tasty, but she raved about the greens as being the best she'd had in her life. The green beans were also delicious. My po' boy seemed a bit on the dry side, and I was not offered any mayo, nor did I think to ask for any. OK, my own fault. There was very little lettuce, and no tomato in my po' boy, which I think would have improved it. The bread, however, was outstanding. My gumbo was savory and very tasty. \nI think the staff here makes the meal special. They work hard to keep everyone happy, and you're likely to be called \"baby\" or \"honey\".

It was busy but we got in quickly (8 of us) and went through the line ordering and getting a table. We were served quickly (about 20 mins, given how busy it was!) and the food was soooooo good! I had the sampler with beans and rice , shrimp creole, and gumbo which were all memorable but i have to say that the shrimp creole was the best I've ever had!", "date": "2018-02-06 17:47:16"}

Couldn't she keep her calm and establish a conversation with us? No problem, we'll walk right back outside, but really there was NO NEED TO YELL. It was almost embarrassing. I felt very out of place, maybe because of my race or because i'm a tourist. She just didn't like it and it was a very negative experience. \n\n2) FOOD: Good. I had the combo Shrimp and Oyster Po Boy and i loved it. Pricy $18 for what it was but very good. Plenty of nicely fried shrimp and oysters in a light layer of mayonnaise. \n\n3) Fried Chicken $11. It was good, the pieces were huge and it came with a biscuit (we didn't know and had ordered another biscuit separately) BUT i have had better fried chicken (Willie's was way better) and in other places (Yardbird, Sweet Chick). So, i would skip it if you're a fried chicken connoisseur. Plus the wait was too long. \n\n4) Roast Beef, I got to try it from my friend and it was AMAZING. Really delicious and so much food in one plate! Share it.\n\n5) Cafe au lait. Eh.\n\n6) Side dishes: Jake's Green Beans and tomatoes + Turnip Greens = Both good.\n\n*Definitely plenty to share from any one dish, unless you don't want to. \n\nAt the end, they apologized to us for their behavior which was nice.", "date": "2018-02-07 05:23:01"}

My only complaint - and this maybe my fault - was that we weren't aware of how the system worked and assumed it's like every other restaurant. It's not. You wait outside in the line (which moves pretty quickly), then wait in the counter line to order. Know what you want prior to getting to the register as those ladies are not messing around. After you order & pay, you take your receipt to the dining room and sit down where your server will collect it, and go back to get your food. She wasn't messing around either. It can be confusing if you've never been there before, and there's not a lot of patience by the staff to explain it either. Also be aware that there's no tipping allowed per signs posted all over the restaurant.

I went with the French fries and beans & rice. I also got a freshly squeezed Orange Juice for ~$3 and their homemade biscuit for ~$2.\nThe fried chicken was really good, in my opinion. The fries were pretty addicting but they weren't out of the ordinary. The biscuit was soft but I wish it was warm. It also comes with butter and grape jelly.\nMother's is definitely worth the trip.

It took 30+ minutes to get everyone in our party of 10 served, by which time the first recipients' food was cold and sandwiches even soggier.

After approximately five minutes of six staff members talking to each other, ignoring me to a level that was laughably bad while I stood very politely and patiently to make my order, they finally took my order.  I asked for a 3 element sandwich: ham, bread, butter. They refused. They ain't gonna do that. \"What?\" I asked humorously shocked. They ain't gonna do that. They wouldn't put the butter on the sandwich. Finally I got the over-priced-for-what-it-is ham sandwich. I put the butter on it from the little packet squares. Thankfully it was at least real butter. I took a bite. I almost spit it out. This was my favorite food to eat as a kid. It was disgusting. I threw most of the sandwich away. I will never go back. This was the most disappointing restaurant experience I've had perhaps ever. And I hate giving anyone a low rating. But this one was deserved. It is sad. I'll never go back. And I haven't had anyone tell me it was any good for years. I had to see for myself. But they were right. It used to be amazing. Unfortunately those days are long gone.

He really appeared excited about Mother's. His eyes lit up and you could almost see him salivate. I was like, yes! I want to try this.\n\nWe ordered roast beef po boy with aus jus (beef juice with flour- a gravy) and side of baked ham. The roast beef was good. The beef was thinly sliced, the au jus offered all the juiciness and flavors. \n\nThe problem was the gravy soaked into the crispy bread so by the time the sandwich hits your table, your sandwich is a soggy mess. You can try to eat it with your hands but it will definitely sag and you will resort to fork and knife.\n\nThe baked ham looked dry in pictures. We ordered it and it was really really really dry. All the gravy from the po boy couldn't save it. It tasted like chewing a stack of napkins. K was a trooper and ate it all with an soup of hot sauce. \n\nPro tip: line up with the menu. Order, pay. Then pick a table. The waitress will bring you your order. \n\nPro Tip: stick with the Po Boys if you come here. Avoid the baked ham.", "date": "2018-05-12 04:23:29"}

I ordered the Famous Ferdi Special, and was just confused by the experience. The meat was cold, but the \"au jus\" was piping hot. Even worse, the au jus was poured right onto the plate, with the sandwich directly on top - which resulted in a soggy bottom of the sandwich that was almost impossible to pick up and eat. And on top of everything, it also cost $15, which I felt was expensive for the area just for a sandwich (that didn't even come with anything).\n\nThe staff were friendly, but the layout was also confusing in regards of where to stand, where to order, where to wait for your food. Also, I noticed a weird racial dynamic which really turned me off - the entire staff was made up of people of color, who were all working hard behind the counter, but then the old, white manager just sat in a chair by the front door. It felt weird to me. \n\nAll in all, maybe if I tried another item on the menu or came back at another time, I would've had a different experience.

We had not planned on going there and hadn't done much research on what we should order and how the setup works.  Fortunately when we got there at 12:30 on a Thursday there was only a line inside and not outside.  That didn't give us a lot of time with the menu so I felt a little bit of self-inflicted pressure reminiscent of ordering from the Soup Nazi. :) \nIt was not necessary though, the woman at the register was very patient with me while I asked about debris (how have I never heard of this before, it's the best part of the roast beef!). I ordered the roast beef po'boy, which is sliced roast beef topped with debris and also comes with mustard and lettuce.  I wanted to order what they are most known for, but if there is a next time, my order will just be a debris po' boy, I didn't love the sliced roast beef as much.  My husband had the Ferdi special and enjoyed it, but I think we were both a little thrown by the mustard and lettuce.  It's not the normal condiment either of us would choose but we wanted to have it they way they serve it because they know best.  \nWe also ordered a cup of seafood etouffe and a cup of shrimp gumbo.  The Gumbo was the best cup I had in NOLA, including the one at Commander's Palace, which was excellent. But this one, the seafood flavor was so deep and the roux so flavorful.  I couldn't get enough of it. The etouffe was good but the gumbo was stand out. Loved it. \nWe had a slice of pecan pie and a brownie for dessert. Our 4 year old had a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries which she ate all of, so there is a success!\nThe staff was friendly and they are old school.  The guy who was working at the front door was casual enough that when he ate his lunch standing next to the door, he helped himself to the salt, pepper and ketchup on our table, without asking. This was totally fine with us, though it did make us chuckle a bit.", "date": "2018-06-01 05:26:02"}

A good majority recommended coming to Mother's. This was our first proper meal in NOLA and we were ravenously hungry, sustaining ourselves off Sun Chips, Dunkin Donuts and granola bars from the airport. \n\nWe were warned there will always be a line. A line to get inside, then a line inside to order. Again, if the food is good enough I'm always willing to wait. It was a bit frustrating because there were 2 women in front of us and apparently they were trying to get ahead because they had a party of legit 25-30 people following suit. However, we fell in line behind these women and then the part of 30 was behind us and they tried to communicate and it was very uncomfortable.\n\nThe line went pretty fast. Apart from that, I ordered a small Grilled Shrimp Po Boy and a bowl of Mae's File Gumbo. My friend got the Famous Ferdi Special Po Boy and potato salad. My boss recommended this specific dish. He was raving about the meat. However, my friend didn't love it because the sauce made the bread soggy and who likes soggy bread? He tried to eat it with a knife and fork and it just got messy. My Po Boy was meh, it wasn't as great as everyone deemed it to be. Maybe this wasn't the place for a Po Boy, I'm not sure. The gumbo was just alright, we had to add salt to taste. The sausage wasn't as flavorful as it looked to be.\n\nHOWEVER, the service here is phenomenal. Mid Po Boy, my friend was thirsting for a Coke. There was a long line, so he went up the to the cashier and asked if he had to wait in line just to get a coke. The employee told him not to worry about it and handed him a coke. When my friend was about to pay, the employee said it was on the house. We Bostonian's are not used to Southern hospitality and the small act of kindness jumped start our trip to a great start.\n\nWould I come back? Probably not.", "date": "2018-06-02 12:52:33"}

First, and worth noting: the staff was extraordinarily friendly and were the high point of our visit. \n\nThe food, though: unremarkable cafeteria fare. \n\nWe ordered jambalaya, red beans, shrimp creole, ham and a biscuit. The best by far was the biscuit. Light, fluffy, delicious. The jambalaya was OK -- the best thing on my plate, but not the best jambalaya I had in town. The red beans, unremarkable but better after we added salt (I shouldn't have to add salt), and the shrimp Creole a shadow of other Creole I had on this trip. The ham -- such a specialty that it's on their sign -- dry and uninteresting on our visit. \n\nMother's strikes me as one of those places you've been told you have to visit if you go to New Orleans. And if you want to experience old-school cafeteria-style eats, by all means go. (The fried chicken *looked* great, but we didn't order it, and the po' boys were massive.) But if you've got one shot to get outstanding Cajun or Creole food, consider taking a pass.", "date": "2018-07-03 00:07:32"}

The establishment dirty, the steam table seems to never get cleaned after dipped into the food. Food is cold, dry and bland! Last but not least the service is awful! No tips allowed may be the culprit or management, not sure which one but the upside the cop on duty directed and guided the flow of customers...he seemed to be the only 1 who likes his JOB because he gave the only smile in the building.!

First, I have to say that time of day is everything!  The later the day goes on the longer the line will be.  What takes the most amount of time, is placing your order.  Once inside, you have to wait in line and move toward the register to place your order.  There is only one register and cashier that take both the order and the money; thus why the wait is long.  Additional note, it is very cold inside, therefore I suggest you bring a coat.\nAfter ordering your food, you try to locate a table and then when seated a server will come by your table to provide you with your eating unitizes and take your ticket to grab your food. So, no seat saving is allowed. \n\nFood:  The food is okay.  I can say that I've had better in NOLA.  Some dishes will come out hot, while other dishes will come out cold.  For example, my waffle arrived warm, while my mother's eggs arrived cold; so she needed to use her grits to warm them up.  The food can be a tad bit salty, especially the roast beef and au ju sauce.  However, all food items are made to order, but are kept in cafeteria style warming dishes.  Lastly, there is no call ahead and take out ordering available. \n\nNote:  you are not allowed to tip any employee within the restaurant.  Signs are posted throughout the restaurant.", "date": "2018-07-19 17:16:19"}

The fact that he was not personable and is the first person you meet as you enter the restaurant. Well that's just bad business management. Food was bland, but edible. Absolutely nothing to write the family about. But prices for this blah were outrageous!\n      \n     This place truly takes you back to the 1800s. It started with the all white military wall (I'm of color and a veteran). The only faces of color were the celebrities that have visited many eons ago. The waitstaff are all people of color and they are meticulously watched, micromanaged and seemingly frustrated by the owners. Or at least the men I assumed were the owners (wearing red shirts). At first I thought it was just me, until our waitress whispered to us we could leave a tip for her if we were so inclined. I thought that was odd...but then I noticed the posted signs about not tipping the waitstaff. Where they do that at?! No tips...so you don't value your employees or want them to be compensated for their service? It felt like I was watching indentured slavery at its finest. I'm from Louisiana, live in San Antonio now and I've never seen anything like it. \n     \n     I'm sorry to even write this review, I really wanted to like it...I was embarrassed that my husband even witnessed this in my state (he's from SC). \n\n**Bottom line: Mother's it's time to upgrade your decor and your mindset.

Here we go, we turn the corner and guess what...there's a huge line in front of Mothers!  OH NOoooo!  We were at that point though that we said let's just wait in line. When we got to the back of the line, an employee was passing around menus to speed up the process.  We were told there was a 45 minute wait, \"Growl\" said my stomach.  Luckily, the staff must of eaten their Wheaties that morning because the line moved fast. We waited 20 minutes outside and another 10 inside, better than expected. \n\nYou order at the counter and then choose a table. Many tables are communal and we ended up sharing one with a nice group from NYC. The feels of Mother's is authentic southern food, like it has so much history and so many people have dined there. They have old school photos on the walls and 3 dining rooms to choose from.  \n\nThe meal came 20 minutes later and it was just what I needed to calm the stomach monster.  Fried chicken, potato salad, beans, green beans and a local beer, Dixie.   I doused the fried chicken with some local hot sauce that was on the table that gave the chicken a kick.  Washed it down with Dixie Lager that was light but not unflavored.  The green beans were to die for. Best green bean salad I've ever had. They were warm with a slight vinegar taste. \n\nExtremely satisfying meal at Mother's. I was a different person walking out than I was coming in!

Entered the restaurant the security guard at the door handed me a menu and said \" Get behind that guy in line\" so I did. Looking at the menu as I waited my turn, I had no Idea what I should order. Got to the cashier... thought to myself... she works her and most likely eats here often... let's let her order for me. So that I did! She was great did even blink, \"combo player with Etouffee\" she says with a huge smile....so that's what I got. Hay it not the cleanest or the fanciest place, far from it! But let me tell you this food has soul that you would only get at a family pot luck! I mean that in a wonderful way. Everyone working her is HAPPY! That a nice thing. Let's get to the food... Etouffee firs..the gravy is delightful and is well complimented with the delicious crawfish, The potato salad fresh, red beam over rice yummy and the green beans were far from al dente they were cooked with tomatoes and spices that bring you home! I love vegetables fresh al dente...but these were good. I feel as if I just tasted what New Orleans is on a plate... a simple slice of heaven.", "date": "2018-09-10 01:21:50"}

The seafood platter had a taste in New Orleans with jambalaya, etouffee, fried catfish, oysters and shrimp.

I'd definitely order again. \n*Best skin-on fried chicken I've had in a very long time and quite possibly the best I've ever had - sorry mom. Crunchy on the outside and tender moist on the inside. Consider an order or two for sharing if you have a large group. \n*Their ham they say is famous just didn't reach the delicious hype they advertise.  It was good, however, and a gracious portion. \n*Their red beans and rice side needed some salt, but it was delicious and authentic New Orleans. Additionally, it was plentiful with ham and sausage.  \n*Yummy warm biscuits are made in house.  You can watch them at their biscuit making craft as they have a sidewalk window that lets you see them in action.\n*They don't want their employees tipped, and there are signs posted as such.  \nI'd certainly return to try their Shrimp Po Boy or have fried chicken and crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e.\nCheers!", "date": "2018-10-14 23:43:33"}

I'm not sure but will say that the people that worked there were really nice  Well, for the exception of the mean cashier that rushed me to take my order when I was TRAUMATIZED to find out they don't sell BACON. I mean, they sell HAM so why not BACON? Especially during breakfast hours? SIGH\n\nSo, after standing in line, my girl and I managed to find seating in a tight corner. I didn't care because I was STARVING! Once seated, within 7 mins our food was brought out to us with a smile! I ordered scrambled eggs and ham sandwich (the biscuit was the best part!!) and grits. The \"world famous ham\" was just Ok to me. Maybe I will try Mother's for dinner the next time I'm in Nawlins. #underwhelmed", "date": "2018-10-15 23:58:07"}

She said she definitely enjoyed. My waitress didn't want to see me NOT eating since my friend had her food and I didn't, so she would bring me biscuits to tide me over lol. The biscuits were good, but I didn't want to get full before the main event. So after 1 1/2 biscuits, I just decided to be patient. True to their word, I put my order in at 1 and the chicken came out at 1:30. The portion of chicken was beyond generous and it was PIPING HOT! The dirty rice and potato salad were excellent as well.

We handed the girl standing next to her our CC to pay, but she said you pay at the table.  As soon as we sat at our table, the server asked us for the receipt.  We explained, we were told to sit down and pay after.  She told us \"no, reach in your bag, it should be with your change.\"  That was it, I went to speak to the Manager.  He sent the young immature and very rude order taker on break. He apologized for her behavior and said he would finish our order, but only after helping several other folks in line first.  needless to say, we decided to leave as we no longer felt comfortable.

Her catfish was cold and had no flavor (at all), the ham was, eh, and the green beans and potato salad were the only items she sort of enjoyed.\nI ordered the grilled shrimp Po Boy and the chicken and sausage gumbo.

The bread pudding wasn't my thing (kinda oily) but the pecan pie was the best ever. \n\nSince then I've been back a few times but mostly it's after we finish our night out of dinner, jazz bars and walking around and I end up grabbing another piece of pecan pie to have in the room just like the first time.", "date": "2019-01-20 16:01:33"}

Hubs got the combo platter for $20 it came with a lot: jambalaya, crawfish ettoufee, red beans and rice, potato salad and cabbage. The jambalaya was definitely the very best thing on the plate. My husband said the ettoufee would have been better with more spice, it was lacking flavor. Red beans and rice weren't special, cabbage was just that-cabbage and the potato salad was very eggy. \n\nI had a \"regular\" size gumbo which was very small, but a little bigger than a cup. It was $8.50 and had to be loaded with crystals hot sauce. Sadly, it was not amazing and had little flavor. We were going to share the combo but hubs was hungry and devoured it all. \nI got up and re ordered more food. I got the fried catfish plate with 2 sides... wait for it...for $17. It was $17 of sadness. I liked the batter but it was flavorless, it was just 3 thin pieces of catfish and it was just not enough. I got turnip greens which had some ham in them and we're excellent. And a side of potato salad, which I didn't mind being more on the eggy side. The best thing was the homemade tartar and cocktail sauce. Those were both really good and helped flavor the sad catfish.\n\nI did also get a \"world famous Bloody Mary,\" it was really good but I have had better. It was really spicy which I enjoyed!\nOverall, if you do find yourself here; stick with the jambalaya, turnip greens, potato salad, and cabbage.

The chicken is super moist and tender and it's coated in a light, crispy and nicely seasoned batter.\n\nJambalaya - I'm usually just okay with jambalaya, but I found this to be really good! It had a nice tomato-y flavor and a hint of spice. The rice was cooked well and had a pillow-y pilaf texture and I found myself eating this the most.\n\nGumbo - Another gumbo, but this one wasn't as thick as the Gumbo Shop.

The security guard came up and very politely told me that the manager said I had to leave because I was intoxicated. I didn't say anything at all, I calmly left and went outside. After stewing over this for a long time (and I never put up reviews) I was really aggravated . I couldn't understand why I was kicked out, I was so quiet, unintrusive, meek, and mild. I didn't complain or put up a fight. So why me out of everyone else in New Orleans who is drunk. I used to live in this city. I cherish this place as a staple of New Orleans. But my husband put it best......they are sexists. I have never experienced this in my life but I do believe it to be true now. A drunk male coming in is fine. A female who has had a bit too much to drink is unacceptable and therefore must be kicked out. If you know me then you know I am the most non combative person so this is coming from a true place.

I think the 3.5 stars it has on Yelp is about right.  Since I don't round up and half stars aren't an option, 3 stars it is.\n\nWe had lunch at Mother's on a Tuesday, arriving around 11:50.  There was a line of 10 or so when we arrived, and by the time we left it was out the door.  The line moved a little slower than I was expecting, although I do not think that was the staff's fault.  It appeared to be due to people taking a long time to decide what they want.  So, the moral of the story is when you are in popular/busy/crowded places, make your mind up quickly.\n\nMy main course was a catfish po' boy, but we all shared so I also tried:  the famous ferdi, fried shrimp, red beans and rice, fries, potato salad, and the ham.  The po' boys are pretty basic, large white rolls with iceberg lettuce, what appeared to be standard store bought dill pickles, and basic mayo.  The catfish was good, it was fried well and it was a good amount.  I did need some salt and pepper, but with seasoning it was good.  The same can be said of the shrimp, it was fried well but needed salt.  The bread to filling ratio was off on the po' boys, I thought there was too much bread.  Had the shrimp and catfish been stronger I would have given 4 stars.\n\nThe sandwiches with ham (the Ferdi and the ham sandwich) were superior in my estimation.  I understand that Mother's is known for its ham, and for good reason.  It was flavorful and tender.  It was the star of the meal.  The ham po boy had was excellent, due in part to the ham and the spicy mustard.\n\nThe Ferdi is good, and as you have seen on TV, it is very messy.  Knife and fork job unless you are willing to get really dirty whilst eating.  The debris is tender and juicy, the bread sort of holds up to the jus, but not really.  As the meal went on the whole thing kind of dissolved.  This sandwich is iconic for a reason and is worth a try.\n\nThe sides were surprisingly good.  I was expecting more standard fries but they were thin, long (maybe the longest fry I have ever eaten, should have taken a pic...) and crunchy.  Very strong.  The potato salad was classic deli potato salad, but it was homemade and prepared well.  The red beans and rice were lacking in seasoning, so a dose of hot sauce was needed.  They were not the best I had on my trip, but I would eat them again.", "date": "2019-03-26 20:15:21"}

Did a quick search on yelp and found Mother's. It was only about a 5 minute walk from our hotel, there was a line but not too long. Dining area appears to look limited but there are additional seating towards the back of the restaurant. Ordering process was a little unique. Be sure to pick up a menu and find your place in line. \n\nBeware...the servers are very strict on cutting the line and blocking walk ways leading towards the kitchen. Please be sure to make way for servers. Please be respectful towards the staff they don't play around. But staff is very friendly. And don't make the mistake of cutting in line especially if you are in a big group. On our second visit at this restaurant, the police officer manning the front door and the owner of the restaurant kicked out a huge party of foreigners. They definitely have the right to not serve you if you are disrespectful.\n\nIt is a good idea to know exactly what you want before reaching the cashier. Coming from California, service is different but not too much of a culture shock. They are straight forward and take orders quickly. I would avoid making too many customizations on orders if you can tolerate it, but that's just me being from California.\n\nThe food was awesome! I've never had a sandwich like the \"Ferdi Special\". We were a party of 3 and pretty much ordered all we could sample on the menu because well when you're in New Orleans you are not on a diet right? I would recommend the Ferdi Special, if you are a light eater you can definitely split this sandwich with a companion. Please note, the cashier will not ask what size sandwich you want specifically. I think they automatically default to a large. So make sure to let them know. We also ordered a pecan pie and sweet potatoe pie which was delicious. I also ordered a waffle because we had to fit breakfast somewhere in there. \n\nOnce you have ordered, take your receipt, find a place to sit and give your receipt to a server. She/He will then proceed to take your drink requests  and will bring your meal hopefully in less than 30 minutes. Keep in mind, service is a bit slower and laid back. Just take it in, enjoy the fact that you are in New Orleans and about to have a very delicious meal.", "date": "2019-03-28 16:24:59"}

This is the cup of joe and an egg sammich joint of Humphrey Bogart movie fame. The staff is stationed behind an old timey stainless steel counter, and you can see various offerings, including their signature ham behind glass sneeze guards. Our first hint that everything wasn't as it appeared was the long line of employees seemingly loitering back there. In truth, to call Mother's a hole in the wall is a stretch, unless your typical hole in the wall includes a long back area, which also opens onto a space that looks a little like an airplane hanger. There's room, and apparently, it's needed. This call was made for us by some of our very favorite people, B and H (because we value privacy), who were down in NOLA, where apparently drinks were consumed and breakfast was required. What came out of that experience was initial contact with the famous MEAT sandwich. There are a few iterations of this specialty, and as of this writing, I'm not sure which one was sampled, though I'm inclined to think it might have been the Ferdi. The straw that stirs this particular drink is what the menu describes as \"debris\", the meat which falls into the pan when cooking roast beef. Janice and I headed over for an absolutely lazy (for us) breakfast at 9ish.  She ordered the Debris Po'boy, while I stuck with a traditional breakfast waffle, though it came loaded with sweet, thick peaches and syrup. In addition, I ordered hot sausages. Janice definitely got the winner here. The debris is luscious, juicy, original and still satisfyingly familiar, and her only regret is that she didn't get the larger sandwich. I only got a bite, so I regretfully seconded her emotion. Not that my waffle was anything to sneeze at. It would have been excellent in any establishment, and I didn't send anything back except a few tablespoons of syrup. And 3/4 of a hot sausage, because they served two, and while scrumptious,  they were huge. It should be noted that service is unique, and  a little strange here. Food is ordered directly from the counter, but served in the back by servers who've been doing it for a minute. The coffee was hot and luxurious, refills came in plenty of time. It should be noted that in several locations throughout the restaurant, signs clearly proclaim that there is \"no tipping\" and that the waitstaff would refuse one if offered. However, when I began to ask our server, before I was four words into the sentence, she said \"it's up to you\".  Pressed, she said that the signage was meant to be a joke, although I will freely admit to not being entertained. The food and the service warranted a gratuity, and any suggestion that people should walk out without leaving one seems to be ill advised and badly intended. Guess what?  I'm going to leave even more next time, and next time can't happen soon enough.", "date": "2019-05-06 22:36:40"}

I hated their seafood platter. Not into the baked ham. So salty and dry... texture almost like canned tuna chunk! Seafood platter was cold, dry, batter so stuck to the seafood. A nice sign of fresh and delicious seafood that hasn't been cooked many times over because it wasn't eaten that day is if you can actually peel off the batter completely from the meat. Catfish sucked--had that texture I hated that's dry and stringyliney and not moist at all. It's like they picked the worst seafood possible at a discount: tiny dry oysters and shrimps that were not plump. It was almost as if they took shrimp, fried it and refried the next day where lots of mostly just bits of batter remained in the platter. Or they fried it and then reheated it. Only the white dipping sauce could save it. I couldn't even remove the breading. Worst ever. Cold too. Deanie's Seafood slays and is delicious wo the sauce if you want some sort of standard. Only thing I liked at Mother's was the string bean red pepper side dish despite its watery base: it had a nice and surprising tang to save it. The turnip leaves were basic and cooked long enough--quite bland despite minimal salt seasoning or whatever else could've been in it. Pecan pie: you only get nuts on the topside, not inside. It's overly sweet. Like the entire inside is the \"binder\" of pecan pie, no nuts on the inside. At least the top and crust had some crunchy texture. I like Redfish's pecan pie which I wish Mother's could be more like. This just was a sugar overload even for a sweet tooth like me. Not sure if they used tons of corn syrup. Salad was horrible. Only the little 3 grape tomatoes was the freshest part of it. It's not worth all I paid for barely a handful of leaves. Barely!

We order our food and then find a table in the refrigerator they seemed to think was a dining room; they kept that room at 50 degrees F, which is not ideal for a  meal, especially when you are dressed for the 90 degree days New Orleans has been dishing out since my arrival. It becomes abundantly clear that our party was just way too cold to eat in the dining hall, so we decided to move to a more comfortable table. Big mistake. Apparently they dont want you to be comfortable at this establishment because they made it clear not only could we NOT seat 5 people at the 4 person tables in the warmer half of the restaurant, we couldn't put them together either. We were condemned to the fridge if my family wanted to sit together. Wha? We decided to take the food home however some of the dishes had not arrived yet. My wife had my 4 year old daughter and her 7 year old cousin with her, while myself and my brother-in-law shivered in the fridge for 10 minutes waiting for the rest of the food. As my wife waited in the warmer half of the establishment she was instructed by the surly wait staff to not stand in ANY of the empty spots she chose to stand in. Finally the food arrived and we GTF outta there. We ate the food at home, and I'm sorry the Fried Chicken po'boy was dry and flavorless. My brother-in-law's Shrimp po'boy was bland as well. WTF? Why do people like this place? Go to McDonalds. You'll get a better meal with a happier wait staff. Gotta give this one the old fart sound review... PHHHHHTTTT!!!", "date": "2019-07-20 23:50:47"}

Finally, it's time to order.  I ordered the 1/2 fried chicken with cabbage and red beans; and a lemonade.

The chicken was GREAT.  Very hot.  Very good flavor.  Juicy.  The cabbage was a little tough and bland.  The red beans were about average.  The lemonade was AWESOME!!  I could have drank a gallon of it.  Very sweet to the taste and very cold.  Our server was \"Alexia L.\"  If I come back to N.

Here's the process:  You are given the menu while you're in line... once you get inside you continue to stand in line as you head to the cashier to place your order and pay for your meal and drink.  There are main dishes and sides so know what you want because the line will go rather fast.   Note:  while you are In the ordering area (which is the main entrance) there is limited seating but you can take this opportunity to glance at the other seated patrons orders as you stand in line.  Don't be rude and ask them questions or point to something Asking what's that?  How does it taste?  Just be casually cool and make your observations and move on.  \nAnyway, after ordering  you will receive your receipt which you will be place on the table where you are seated.  Now, you can either sit in the main area if a seat is available or head further into the restaurant where there are more seating options.  This is up to you...., find a seat and sit there.  We sat near the bar which was close to the exit out.  Place your ticket on the table and a waiter/waitress will greet you, pick up the receipt and get your order.  In a few minutes you'll have your food.  \n\nMy order of crawfish etoufee was PERFECTION.  I had sides of red beans and rice and potatoe salad.  The red beans and rice where very good as well.

Their whole setup is confusing as soon as you walk through the door. The staff gave us dirty looks the entire time we were there. Yes, we're female tourists, damn! Me and my party was told to grab a menu by some guy working there on the way in. We were about to sit down to look over the menu to order but, a woman told us to order first and then sit down. I'm used to sitting down with my menu and looking it over then, the waiter gets our order but, I'm awkwardly, standing up against a wall trying to find what I want on this big ass menu. I settle on something quick because I'd be more focused sitting. A few minutes later a woman tells us to hurry up and stand in the line to not lose our place in line. We stand in line, and aren't greeted at all with a \"Hi\" or \"Welcome\" by anyone. We finally order individually, and pay at the counter. By the time my daughter places her order, the woman cashier looks annoyed as hell with her and starts admiring her fingernails, totally disregarding her. We're told to sit anywhere we want. We go to another side of the restaurant and wonder how will I be found for my food. We sit and a few minutes later, another woman comes up and asks to see our tickets. Shortly, our food arrives. We order 2 omelets with cheese grits, toast, a biscuit, a chicken plate with, cheese grits, and red beans and rice. The grits were creamy but, needed butter, salt and pepper. Not bad. The fried chicken was good, the breast was moist and seasoned well. Red beans and rice was bland, not much flavor. The omelets were average and we couldn't find the cheese in them. The service and staff sucks. The food is average and will skip this place the next time I'm in town. There are much better restaurants here in NOLA with friendlier staff. I'm so glad that tips are not recommended because I wouldn't have left any of them a tip anyway.", "date": "2019-09-09 18:51:50"}

Really famous place that has been serving food for decades now; primarily known for the debris po-boy and/or breakfast, but also has a pretty good traditional style Southern breakfast too. Deviate from these choices at your own risk...Wait was about 20-25 minutes at 10 a.m. Food is cafeteria style, so you order and pay first and then give the receipt with the order to the server, who then places the order in the kitchen after you pay...Food comes out pretty quickly when the order goes in.\n\nWas with two others for this meal; we all had varying experiences and different dishes. One person had a turkey po boy, which basically was more like a turkey hoagie, and not a particularly good one. I get they are trying to appeal to a broad audience so they include this, but I'd probably take it off the menu. Very bland.\n\nAnother member of the group had a ham and egg breakfast sandwich, which consisted of a biscuit with ham on it, plus eggs on the side. I tried it and liked the ham (pretty thick piece), but the person who ordered it thought it was only OK. \n\nI had the best meal of the bunch, having grits with roast beef debris. The roast beef debris is one of the best tasting items I have had in a while, and was perhaps the best single bite of anything I had on the trip! Yet, others didn't really enjoy their food that much.\n\nPrices are quite good, and I found the food to be really good too, but again, kind of polarizing, so can't give it 5 stars.", "date": "2019-10-19 03:09:23"}

I also ordered the Turnip Greens, I love greens anywhere but these were just perfect with my meal.

It looks buffet like on the other side of the counter and some of the food looked like it had been sitting for awhile. The restaurant itself was dirty and in need of a good cleaning. After we ordered our food we all discussed our doubts of eating and the uncleanliness. But we decided the food must taste really good. A kid came over to our table and took our receipts and said he was going to get our food and refill our drinks as needed. He also said he would appreciate a tip if the service was good. We saw signs on the walls that said no tips allowed. Go figure???\n\nOur food came and left so much to be desired. They are famous for their Famous Ferdi Special and \"World's Best Ham\". Yeah not anymore. The red beans and rice had no flavor at all. Zip zilch nada. The sausage didn't even have any flavor. Cheryl had the crawfish etouffee which she said was ok but barely had any crawfish. The Famous Ferdi Special was supposed to have baked ham, roast beef and debris with gravy. The sandwich was cold, the bottom a soggy mess and legit only one piece of thin ass ham and roast beef which looked like it came out of a can and the debris/gravy (the best part of the entire meal). \n\nWe were so disappointed. During our time in NOLA we asked several of our Uber drivers (who were born and raised in NOLA))about Mothers and to our surprise the locals all agreed. They said Mother's changed owners a few years back and the food has gone way downhill. When we asked why they always had long lines one gentleman said why did you go there? Touch\u00e9!

This visit happened in November 2019\nI had heard about Mother's and so I had to make the drive from Baton Rouge to check it out. Probably not the best idea to go on a Sunday while the Falcons are in town to play the Saints, but hey, I'm here now. \nThere was a long line out of the door and it moved a little slow. The person at the door was letting a feel people in at a time. Once inside there was another line. It looks small with limited seating inside but I found out that the restaurant was bigger than I thought. There was plenty of seating in the back. \nI found a small table near the register and close to a tv. Score!\nI ordered the fried chicken plate. The chicken was great. Crunchy yet juicy. The green beans were seasoned and prepared well. I also had the shrimp creole that had a great spice to it. I really liked the jambalaya. It had a great smokey flavor with a little spice. It was so good. After I finished my meal I decided to walk it all off around the French Quarter. I couldn't get that jambalaya off of my mind. I ended up go back and getting a large order of jambalaya. Since I was in traffic from New Orleans to Baton Rouge I was able to eat it in the car. This will be aa definite  go to when I'm  back on New Orleans", "date": "2020-01-18 06:01:55"}

We went on a Thursday afternoon (group of 6). You order at a counter and the runners pick up your receipt after you sit and then bring your order to you. Below is what we tried:\n\n-Ralph - This is a Po Boy with baked ham, debris, roast beef and cheese. The debris releases some au jus, so the bread on the bottom WILL get soggy. I didn't mind this, but some in our group did. I'm sure if you were to ask them not to they would put less au jus. The sandwich was great, but didn't knock me out of the park. \n-Cheese Grits - DELICIOUS, the star of the meal in my book\n-Ferdie - the same as the ralph, just without cheese. \n-Pecan Pie - AMAZING, another star\n-Seafod Platter = skip this. everything tastes the same, and it was obvious that the oil was old and had been used for awhile \n-Jumbalaya - also pretty good, though a tad dry\n\nOverall it's a good place for a quick bite, but given how many people RAVED about this place I just dont feel like it lived up to the hype.

Be prepared for a wait, because there's a lot of lines involved. Came here with 3 other people on a Tuesday around 1:30pm. Waited for about 13 min of outside before the guard let us wait inside. We waited for about 16 minutes before we got up to the cashier to order. They recommend checking your receipt before leaving to make sure your order is correct. They do take credit cards. The line never did die down, and it seemed like people just kept coming. You order first before grabbing a seat. \nThe restaurant is a lot more spacious than I thought - there are a lot of tables that could fit up to 12 people as well as smaller 4 person ones. There are bathrooms available with 3 stalls. Once you're seated, a head waiter takes your receipt and directs your orders to your table.  It took about 40 min for food to come out, but that's because we got the fried chicken, which is made to order. The fried chicken was a tad too salty but I liked the crispiness of the skin. The plate of fries we got were huge and good for four people. They're thin cut and reminded me of crispier In-n-Out fries. The regular size famous ferdi special po'boy was quite heavy and could easily feed 2 people alone. I liked how the au jus soaked into the bread so it was slightly soggy but very juicy. For first-timers I would recommend the combination platter which came with a sampling of different New Orleans classics. The jambalaya we got was very filling, and the the shrimp creole was equally good. The red beans and rice were a bit underwhelming but it's also a side, so nbd. Overall, there's hearty servings of good Cajun food.", "date": "2020-03-15 02:22:27"}

I knew after using all my tools in my arsenal that I had to stop at Mother's while I was near. I highly recommend asking the staff you engage with what they eat or order from Mother's!\n\nLouisiana was monitoring their COVID cases regularly and required masks everywhere. I noticed Mother's was operating with mainly takeout orders because their dining room was operating 6-8 tables with spacing. I eat like a heathen if I've been driving for ten hours, so the idea of no one being in shock or awe of my method and taking my order to go was the right choice. \n\nWe ordered three sandwiches on French bread. All were crafted with Mother's famous slow simmered pot roast beef. I ended up with sliced turkey, sliced roast beef and a side container of pot roast with pan juice. I tried to turn it into a French dip but the cabbage and mayo fought me. I have no regrets except that I didn't ask for an extra side of au jus to really make my dream happen. \n\nI love the interior of their restaurant. It had the feel of home but still highly functional as pace picked up. Mother's has a chunk of history built into the experience of walking it. It felt like someplace I wanted to come back to over and over. Every member of their team was warm and engaging. The staff was so amazing and I got so wrapped up in telling about my trip that I left my wallet and drove to Shreveport without a care. They went the extra mile to get in touch with me and let me know. \n\nIf you love the hometown feel of great food, wonderful staff and warm feelings- Mother's should be on your list of must visit stops. I will be back next time I am in town.\n\n\nTips:\n\n*The roast beef is worth every penny and all the compliments. Do not miss it if your even slightly a fan of Sunday dinners of yesteryears.\n\n*The menu posted on their website was outdated and prices were higher, so that is something to consider if your calling in to make an order. \n\n*I would suggest getting a smaller portion of their famous Ferdi and something breakfast oriented to share.", "date": "2020-07-12 14:36:23"}

Crunchy skin, juicy meat, it was totally wicked! Definitely one of those places worth going back to.", "date": "2020-07-29 03:57:45"}

They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner; however, I do not ever recall eating breakfast there.  Way back in the 80's, I was a semi-regular patron and loved to go here, especially when friends were visiting from out of town.\n\nThe breakfast offerings are pretty much what you would expect from any local diner or restaurant.  Nothing spectacular, but they do have a very good made from scratch biscuit.  Lunch, in my opinion, is what keeps Mother's going.  Their self-touted \"World's Best Baked Ham\", as I recall from my last visit a few years ago was pretty solid, especially since I not a ham freak.  Their signature dish is their original Debris with au jus gravy.  For those not in the know, the original Debris is a roast beef po-boy made from \"the roast beef that falls into the au jus gravy in the pan while roasting in the oven\".  This is a deliciously good, sloppy, dripping sandwich and is probably their #1 or #2 seller if I had to guess.  Their other signature sandwich is the \"Famous Ferdi Special\".  This po-boy is similar to the original Debris, but it adds their famous baked ham.  Speaking of ham, Mother's offers three varieties of their ham:\n\n1.  Baked: (sliced)\n2.  Black: (crust)\n3.  Fried: (thick)\n\nTheir black ham, which I am not sure is signature to Mother's is \"the seasoned, caramelized crust sliced from the World's Best Baked ham\".  This tends to sell out quickly, so you better order at breakfast if you really want it.  \n\nRegarding dinner, Mother's is not my recommendation.  They do offer po-boys, salads, daily specials, red beans & rice, gumbo, jambalaya and etoufees.   However, I feel they are just average at best.  If you are a tourist one stop to Mother's is ok if you want to \"check off that box\" of places to eat.  However, the lines, especially at lunch are super long.  I recommend lunch and stay with the original Debris or Famous Ferdi.  In my opinion, this place is a non-existent 2.5 rating of just ok, but I rounded them up.", "date": "2020-08-19 12:05:29"}

I don't eat spicy foods so I was scared to eat most of the food in Louisiana due to their cajun flair. Flavor isn't my issue. Spicyness is and my tastebuds are quite sensitive.\n\nService: The waitstaff and cashiers were full of southern hospitality. If there was a host or hostess, I did not encounter them. You basically stand in line and place your order once you get to the cashier's station. After you place your order, you take your number to a table of your choosing and a member of the waitstaff will bring your order to you. Our waiter was so much fun. His sense of humor was perfect! \n\nFood: Due to my sensitivity, I felt safe ordering a shrimp po-boy after I was assured the shrimp was not spicy. I asked for extra mayo on the side just in case. Turns out I didn't need the extra mayo because the shrimp wasn't spicy at all, yet it was flavorful so YAY! The cheesy grits were delish and OH SO cheesy! My sister needed something sweet after our meal so she got the bread pudding with brandy sauce. BABY YES! She also got the red beans and rice which did not look appealing to me. She said they were pretty good in taste. \n\nOdds & Ends: From what I could tell, there was no parking for this location. Upon first entry, it looks like the place is a small hole in the wall. Well, it's much bigger in space than it appears because there is an entire seating section on the opposite side of the kitchen wall. WHOA the extra space! This is also the same side where the bar is located. We chose a table right in front so my sister could start her Mardi Gras drinking in style haaahaaa.", "date": "2020-08-27 21:14:54"}

Tables are spaced apart and we felt safe eating here.  The air conditioning was very comfortable.  At this time, food is served table side, not cafeteria style. \nPortions are huge.  We opted for the smaller version of the Ferdi special po boy and the smaller bowl of jambalaya and it was still more than we could finish, especially the sandwich.  The wait for the food wasn't bad.  Prices are a good value, very reasonable for the amount of food you receive.  \nThe not so stellar:  We were seated in a back room, right next to the waitress station.  Our waitress wasn't outright rude, but just made us feel like we were a big nuisance to her.  Not friendly.  We visited on a hot summer day and had to ask for cold water several times.  \nThe food was just ok.  Not terrible, but not memorable either.  Especially compared to other meals we had in Louisiana.

Mother's is one of those.\n\nI only discovered Mother's by walking past. It is unfortunately not reviewed very well and so it lists behind others when it really needs to be higher. This isn't a fancy restaurant and it isn't touristy so I believe some folks are comparing it to those others unfairly. This is a simple place and it's absolutely delicious. If you're looking for a cheap and filling meal without all the gaudiness of Bourbon Street, Mother's.\n\nLike most businesses, they win or lose based on the staff. This evening's staff won. We were handily served by Renee and Marvin. Starting off with drinks. I don't care for Bloody Mary's because I don't like tomato juice but I was talked into having one tonight. And it was very good. Quite spicy, very peppery and woooooo, strong. My dining mate wouldn't be convinced to try one and so Renee made up a special drink for her and she enjoyed it. We don't know what it was other than Absolut and some juices, so we're calling it \"The Renee.\"\n\nAs for the food, I chose the baked ham dinner. With three sides, this is a massive mountain of food. The collard greens had ham in them, the red beans and rice had ham in them and the potato salad did not. Still, it was creamy and potatoey (is that a word?) and of course the baked ham at the center of the plate was excellent. When the place says \"best baked ham in the world\" then it darned well better be. And it was. Thick, meat, not fatty. Delicious. And holy cow, a solid $15 plate of lots of food!\n\nWe opted not to have dessert here as there were other plans.\n\nMother's is underrated. It was inexpensive, it was tasty and there was plenty of it. Sure, there are fancier joints in the city. But Mother's is worth it.\n\n[Review 14061 overall, 1383 of 2020, number 5 in Louisiana.]", "date": "2020-10-19 13:33:05"}

I brought it back to my room in a paper grocery bag before I opened up to take a look, and saw it was container of beef swimming in au jus along with a baguette already dressed with the toppings, and a ridiculous serving of fries.

It too was fantastic and large enough where you really could split it with another person.

I wanted try something local and the grits with crawfish etouffee caught my eye. Its grits in a seafood like sauce or gravy. It was very tasty and really good. \n   The sign mentions that they have the best ham here. I tried a side. It was good. It was tender. It wasn't sweet or salty. It was good and thick.\n   I tried the plain biscuits. Boy are they big. I really liked them. They tasted freshly done and homemade. They came with jelly and butter.  \n   I can see why this place is popular with the locals. The food is good. The staff friendly and it has a great atmosphere.

All the employees are starting to walk out with their food to go home. He then returns 20 minutes later, with what he says is our food & proceeds to say he had lost our ticket & the kitchen had already closed & he had to ask them to make us our food. Basically blaming us for him having to ask the kitchen to make our food when HE lost the ticket. Not once did he apologize for HIS mistake. The food was incredibly cold.

The staff was very friendly. We each ordered the breakfast special with over-easy eggs. My son and I ordered the debris as our meat, $12.50. My husband with the baked ham, $11. I also got a side of red beans and rice. It took some time to get our order and when it came out everything looked as if it had been sitting for awhile at the pick-up station. There was a film over the under-seasoned grits that they get if they've been sitting. They were cold. Every one of our eggs was over medium to over well. Sent my sons back because his was the most overdone. The waitress was very kind and made sure they were done correctly. The red beans and rice, sadly, was also cold, and had no seasoning. The baked ham was delicious though, as well as the biscuits. The most disappointing part of the meal was the debris. It was also cold on both our plates and was basically just a pile of really under-seasoned shredded roast. No one liked it, which breaks my heart. I had been looking forward to this place and this meal for months. Maybe we caught them between shifts of breakfast and lunch? Maybe Covid regulations has disrupted how they prepare things (no more counter lunch line style service, so things are always hot)?

Let's start with the great, everyone was very nice, waitress, the lady in the front absolutely amazing!!  Atmosphere Great as soon as you walk in you feel like you at Mother's (right at home).  Now let's go to the food, so I had the backed ham, potato salad, turnip greens (I really wanted collards).  The ham was boiled to long it tasted like, had no flavor at all couldn't even taste a bit of salt.  Turnip greens flavored but way over cooked they were mushy, potato salad pretty good, had onions in it and I don't like onions but with this I could smell the onions and got some onion flavor, but did not taste the pieces of onion they were chopped very fine.  The fried chicken pretty good full of flavor, fish not so great, it wasn't fried good need a lot of flavor.  Now that Gumbo, I'm sorry I did not like it, no flavor, smelled to fishy it turned me off, I added Tabasco still bad.  I was very upset with that.  Rice and beans once again no flavor and a lot of hard rice.  I would go back to try something different or for drinks for the atmosphere.", "date": "2021-05-08 23:32:30"}

Someone came in claiming to be the owner without properly identifying himself and I was very uncomfortable and upset with the way he spoke to our server. It was very condescending, belittling and rude. He had an issue with the sequence of his meal arrival.

She was doing a fantastic job and his opinion should have been addressed to management if it was something that needed to be changed.

It started with the hosts, that told us there was a 45 minute wait, so we walked around for about 15 minutes, and discovered that we got called during that time.  We got put to the back of the line. That was our fault to a point, so we accepted it and waited.  Once we were seated, there were several negative things that happened during the wait for our food, but suffice to say that it took about an hour to get our food, and it was wrong.  We ordered sandwiches, so you wouldn't expect it to take that long, but theoretically other's food was ahead of ours, but we noticed that a couple of our sandwiches were on the counter for at least 20 minutes, since we watched them grab them when our order finally came.   The waiter never got us a refill, and he disappeared for most of our time there.  We even watched him go across the street for some reason.  We went to the counter to get our own refills, and the staffer barked at us.  The tickets were wrong, but we didn't want to bother to correct it.  By the expression when we asked about paying, it was obvious that the waiter didn't want to handle the bill, so we got in line to pay.  We were 2nd in line, yet we stood in line about 20 minutes to start to pay our tickets, and then about 15 to 20 more minutes to pay, because they couldn't figure out how to handle separate tickets.  They charged my card the wrong amount, so then had to refund it and recharge it. There were people complaining all around us for many other reasons. The food was good, but not great.  My soft shell crab poboy was not that good, but the sides were good.  Had the food been great, I might've given it 1 or 2 more stars, however the service and bad attitudes were the worst that I've experienced in my life.

There is a long line and they need to do a better job at seating people. When we got called in, they called 4 other groups at the same time. So when we got inside, there were 5 empty tables all at once. This poses the issue of why didn't they seat people as the tables became empty? You just made all these people wait when we could have been seated inside already. Also, you put tons of strain on the kitchen when you are taking orders from 5 tables all at once, 2/5\n\nSome of the food is made beforehand and then plated like cafeteria style. It isn't made to order. An example of this is the scrambled eggs. If they're made in a huge batch ahead of time, it just sits there and gets overcooked while waiting to be served, 3/5 The biscuits were ok, slightly crumbly and dry but holds enough to get some spread on it. The server who has been there for 40+ yrs or something is awesome and the life of the room. She single handedly helps the restaurant with improving the value. \n\nThe serving sizes is huge. When the food came out we were like uh, I guess we're gonna have leftovers. Grits with crawfish etouffee and grits with 2 eggs. I'm on the fences if the wait was worth it because you also have the wait of how long the food took to come out. I think it would be worth it if you came first thing in the morning with no wait to be seated. Other than that, I'm not sure if the wait outside and for the food is worth the time spent there.", "date": "2021-07-14 21:31:01"}

To drink I will say that the Bloody Mary was just middle of the road.

The jus coming off the debris mixed in with the grits was a really nice bite.

The bite of the Ferdi after dipping it into the jus from the debris was a much better bite though.  I'd recommend you ordering a side of the jus with this sandwich.  I also added some of the herbed oil on the table for the last couple bites and that was nice too.

Open since 1938. We were informed by someone who recently lived in town that this was our best bet for a great sandwich within an easy walk of the WWII Museum as we only had limited time today before our flight home.  It is a cafeteria style place, ordering at the counter then paying before having your meal brought to you. Every employee we interacted with was friendly and full of southern hospitality. The walls are covered with multiple photos of friends, family, and famous folks who have visited. It does appear that some more attention should be paid to cleanliness. But I chock it up to just being busy all day. Nothing to worry about. Menu full of southern faves like gumbo, fried chicken, jambalaya, and catfish. Plus breakfast served all day.  We knew coming in that po-boys were our choice. They have two sizes, regular and small. Unless you have 4 people, are a lumberjack, or a ditch digger, get the small. We ordered the small ham and the small fried shrimp. Along with potato salad & green beans. Even these small sandwiches are huge. Dressed with cabbage (not lettuce!) pickles, mayo, and a large amount of mustard. The bread was the perfect choice, soft and moist.  My wife's shrimp po-boy was delicious. Really well-prepared shrimp, light and sweet. We ate all the shrimp but many were eaten from a fork. The sandwich was just too big. My ham sandwich was good but I felt like the ham was nothing special. Obviously well made and not something processed or mass produced. But no better than other bone-in hams I've eaten other places. The sandwich was too heavy on mustard for me so I pulled some off. I only ate half and saved the rest to eat on our flight. The beans were pedestrian but the potato salad was delicious. Great flavor profile. I don't know if they are the best in town but we really enjoyed our meal. I'd love to return for breakfast someday.", "date": "2021-11-25 19:38:00"}

Chad went out of his way for us, and was very patient as we worked through the very extensive menu with our tired and indecisive kiddos.  \n\nThe mimosas were great, the kids were happy with their fried chicken, and the wife & I were delighted with our catfish, beans and rice, gumbo, and the Jambalaya was off the hook!    My only wish was that the food was hot/spicy.   Flavor was amazing and I adjusted it to my taste with the Louisiana hot sauce readily available.", "date": "2022-01-04 07:33:52"}

Everything was served hot and in plentiful portions! Prices were reasonable too. Pancakes look \"heavy\" but are super light and delicious! The biscuits too!  Service is down home friendly. It was only a block from our hotel so it was easy to walk to. Make sure you have proof of vaccination or negative COVID test for entry (as all NO restaurants are requiring). I can't comment on the lunch/dinner food since we only had breakfast there every morning of our trip except the first day. Glad we stumbled upon this gem.

This place has all of the hallmarks of a classic, homestyle restaurant, but the food was bad and overpriced. I order a large shrimp creole and received a small bowl full of watery sauce with no shrimp and mediocre rice. My brother ordered fried catfish and fries. The catfish was okay, but not very well seasoned and the fries were limp and soggy. After a 45 minute wait and $40 later, I left sad and hungry. I would have had a better experience at say, Popeyes.
