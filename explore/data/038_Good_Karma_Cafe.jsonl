I've seen days where people will simply come to work, other days where it's bubbling with conversation, other days a mix. Great for catching up with friends, dates, or just getting some work done on your own (with their free wifi)! \n\nService: Highlight of coming to this cafe - the employees are very kind and friendly! I was super indecisive between soups, and was offered a free sample of one.\n \nFood: Their soups will change, but I love their chicken + peanut soup. It was a bit on the oily side, but carried a lot of flavor. When I had a head cold, this really hit the spot! Coffee - they offer almond and soy milk at no additional cost (very rare for a coffee shop), and their special drinks are delicious! The latte I had was a bit diluted though, so I'll stick with their seasonal drinks in the future.\n\nRecommended Must-Try: Sugar plum drink - not too sweet, but delicious blend of vanilla into your coffee! I also have yet to get a soup I haven't liked - quite affordable ($6.50 for 16oz) and flavorful. A tad on the oily side sometimes, but I'm still obsessed. \n \nOverall: 4.5/5 - I love coming to this cafe.
