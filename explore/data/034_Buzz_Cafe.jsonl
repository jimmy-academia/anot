Had (Philly's favorite) La Colombe coffee and The Inferno (scrambled eggs, chorizo & cheddar with jalape\u00f1o hash & ghost pepper slaw, avocado, insanity aioli & chipotles on a habanero wrap), which they say is \"hotter than a Kensington Tire Fire\" (which did not disappoint) - an excellent combination of flavors that I'll soon order again after trying some other offerings. The premises are cozy & welcoming - the kind of coffee shop to open a book and hangout awhile. The decor is Star Wars themed (plus a nice smattering of artwork depicting local places) and that theme is ubiquitous; I sat at a table adjacent to R2D2 & ET and, when I asked for the WiFi password, I was challenged to cite the 1st two words Princess Leia speaks. Hosts Jeff & (owner) Terrance were most welcoming (and generous). The fun continues ma\u00f1ana with http://facebook.com/events/2035365283257795.

Danielle's deelishish baked goods (I mean there are cookies, bread pudding, cakes, cup cakes...the list is endless)\n4. Coffee drinks: seriously, they will make anything. Yesterday, I had a chocolate malt latte. It was sinful\n5. Music: both canned and live. Sometimes they open late on friday and local bands play upstairs. \n6. Art: this place is visually pleasing. The owner displays his paintings and recently, they held an art show for a local artist who is displaying his work for a month.\n7. Sandwiches: They serve both breakfast and lunch options which are only limited by the ingredient choice and your imagination. My current sandwich of choice is cream cheese, turkey, tomato, and cucumber on a multigrain bagel.\n8. Salad: Any sandwich can be made into a salad or anything you imagine can be a salad. I'm a big fan of the curry (Thai not Jamaican) chicken salad salad and speaking of the curry chicken salad....\n9. The Curry Chicken Salad: I'll admit, I was disappointed because I was expecting a Jamaican curry but I quickly got over it. I mean peanuts, golden raisins, celery, red pepper flakes, and  rotisserie chicken manage to come together wonderfully. It's ambrosia. \n10. The staff rocks: They are cool, laid back, nice, and they love my dog.\nOverall, I give this place 5 stars.
