Ricci's has been in business since 1920 and any business that can not only survive, but flourish after hitting a century mark, has to be doing something right. \n\nHoagies ate a Philadelphia staple and definitely a food of the working man. A hoagie allows someone to eat something substantial in a quick an efficient manner. You don't have to worry about a fork and knife to help you in eating it. I heard somewhere that a sandwich was a favorite amongst truckers because they could eat it while driving. I do not know about the authenticity of the story, but it makes sense. But I think what allowed hoagies (or subs, grinders, whatever you want to call them) to survive is that they also taste great.\n\nI can say that a hoagie is one of my favorite meals. It is a perfect culmination of bread, meats, cheeses, veggies, vinegar, oil and spices and has been embraced worldwide as a lunch (or donner) favorite. Ricci's do hoagies right and as it continues to get handed down through the generations, I hope that they continue to flourish.\n\nSo, after over a hundred years, the community still loves Ricci's and after eating here, you will understand why. My go-to hoagie has always been an Italian and they do their Italian right. It is a substantial meal at a fair price and it is something that you will return to Ricci's again and again for.\n\nAs Ricci's enters into their second century, they still produce an outstanding product. With them continuing to do so, I can see them making it another century and beyond.", "date": "2022-01-11 14:07:02", "user": {"name": "John", "review_count": 3148, "yelping_since": "2018-08-03 12:39:48", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.0, "fans": 87}}
