In fact, I would say for a solid meal, one person should probably have 2-3 slices, 4 if you are hungry. \n\nI think that what really stands out about these slices is the dough, which stands alone in terms of its own flavor - savory, chewy, and a little bit salty, just as a good dough should be.

Of course, in part because of the fact that I am a scientist who works with fermented foods and nutritional supplements, I am well aware of the health benefits of eating fermented foods, and of the even far more powerful health benefits afforded by long-fermented grain products such as long-fermented pizza dough.\n\nI should also mention that I have, in the past, made batches of long-fermented sourdough bread where the dough had been fermented for 3 to 4 days before cooking the loaf. In fact, it is safe to go further and say that I am a connoisseur of long-fermented breads and other dough-based products. The flavor and texture of long-fermented dough products alone make them stand out heads and shoulders above other baked products, and the added nutritional benefits are just one more plus!\n\nI first discovered this unique and worthy shop while on a walk one morning while visiting Philadelphia a few years ago. When I walked in to check out the shop, I was stunned, and incredibly pleased, to discover that they make the dough for all of their pizza and other dough-based products only using long-fermentation methods, wherein the dough is allowed to ferment for at least 72 hours before baking! Yummy! \n\nSince that time, every time that I visit Philadelphia -- which is usually twice per year, for about 7-8 days per stay -- I always visit this shop to pick up a few slices of pizza, which I then bring back to my room, where I eat as much as I can, and then the rest goes in the fridge for later meals.\n\nThe quality of this pizza, and particularly of the dough, is nothing short of amazing and incredible. The dough is so light and fluffy, and yet so tasty, that it seems almost impossible that such an incredible food actually exists, and these characteristics are all due entirely to the long fermentation time and the high-quality products used in making the dough (and the toppings as well).\n\nIn fact, it is 12:40 PM as I write this review, and one hour ago I walked from my hotel to this shop to purchase a few slices of their pizza to go. I then walked the box a few blocks back to my hotel room, where I devoured almost 3 slices, and the remainder went into my fridge.\n\nI can honestly say that I have never tasted a better pizza dough, nor a better fermented bread or sourdough bread product than the dough/crust in this pizza, anywhere in the world. This shop is my sole go-place for pizza made with long-fermented dough.  \n\nMy only regret is that they do not offer loaves of bread made with this dough! It would be downright incredible! In fact, I also wish that they would consider offering for sale, via the web, frozen loaves of partially-cooked long-fermented bread and pizza crust, and if they did, I would probably purchase a dozen frozen loaves per month, to be delivered via Fedex or UPS to my rural home in the Appalachian mountains!\n\nIn closing, all that I can say is that the texture, taste and flavor of this pizza is amazing!
