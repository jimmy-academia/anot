I've really never had an issue before, but this Cosi was the exception.\n\nI work right around the corner so I went there today for the first time for a quick bite. I entered the store and was greeted by a sign that said Salads to the right, Sandwiches to the left. I was confused because at every other Cosi I've been to you just order at the register and they bring the food to the table. I was also ordering a Taste two (half salad+half sandwich) so I wasn't sure which line to get in. I decided on the salad line because it seemed like the logical progression of the line to the register. \n\nI get to the front of the line and the guy asks me what I want. I told him I wanted the taste two with a Signature Salad and a Pork Belly Bahn Mi sandwich. Without looking at me he asks \"White or wheat\"? I had no idea he was talking to me and I could hardly hear because it was loud. When I didn't answer he yelled at me and was extremely rude. When I told him what I wanted he went over to the sandwich people and told them my sandwich order. He then told me to slide down to the other side and wait for my sandwich.\n\nI noticed that everyone else in line got an order slip to bring up to the register. I got nothing, but I assumed the sandwich people would give me one when they were finished making other people's orders. I was standing there waiting while three more people ordered and received their sandwiches and eventually I thought there was no way it was taking them that long to make my order. After standing there for about 7 minutes I asked the lady if someone was making mine and she said the guy in the back was. Well I noticed he was making a full sized sandwich and I ordered a half size. I notified her of this, and she asked me if I ever got an order slip. I said no. She wrote one up for me and told me I could go pay at the register and they would bring me my sandwich. \n\nI figured they would just give me the whole sandwich that they had already made to make up for the fact that I had been waiting for so long (which they never really acknowledged even though I was waiting directly in front of the counter AND the manager walked past several times). They gave me a half sandwich anyway. What did they do? Cut the sandwich in half and throw out the rest? Make a whole new sandwich? They never even asked if my order was for there or to go. I wanted to eat in house but they wrapped everything up and didn't give me a tray.\n\nWhen I finally sat down, I opened my salad and it was pretty lacking. Whenever I've eaten at cosi the salad is usually very sizable with the lettuce piled above the rim of the bowl. Since they had given me a lid (because they never asked if I was eating there or to go) there was hardly any lettuce, and what was there was absolutely DRENCHED in dressing. I'm talking, when I was finished eating, there was at least a centimeter of dressing remaining at the bottom of the bowl. They also gave me white bread when I had ordered wheat.\n\nI gave it two stars because, besides the bread being wrong, my Sandwich was ok. I had never had that particular sandwich from Cosi before so I have nothing to compare it to, but for what its worth I liked it. I'll be fair.\n\nThis is the first Cosi I have been to for a few months, so I have no idea if Cosi just changed their ordering layout or if this particular location is one of the only ones that does it this way. It was completely unorganized and prone to error. I will not be returning to this Cosi location which is a shame, because it is the closest one to my work and I really do enjoy Cosi's food.

My husband picked it up, brought it home and when we opened the bag, we found the salad - one-third the size of the usual portion. I called the store and was told, \"Yes, now we're making the salad the RIGHT WAY!\"  For 15 years it's been made the WRONG way consistently?!?!?  \"Now we're weighing the lettuce,\" they added.

Horrible Horrible Operations at this location!!  \n\nPlease Cosi Management - send someone who knows what they are doing to set some standards at this location!!\n\nSampling of various visits over the last 4 months.  \n\n1.  As other reviewers commented, there are 2 lines, one for sandwiches and the other for salads.  The lines are \"loose\" - you can usually order from either line - the people behind the counter don't seem to care.  Nor do they care if someone walks up ahead of you and orders, they don't really notice who is in line.  There is no semblance of order.  \n\n2.  The menu clearly states a price for Half Salad and Full Salad.  I tried to order a half salad and the person making my salad (who has worked there as long as I have been going there - 4 months) told me I can only get a half salad if I get a Half and Half option (half soup/salad/sandwich).  Well, that is not what the menu says, but nevertheless I ordered a full salad.  At the cashier I asked if it was possible to order a half salad as stated on the menu board.  She said, hmm, I'm not sure, and looked at the cash register.  Then she said, yes, because it is on the register, I guess you can.  \n\n3.  The menu clearly states that you can substitute any meat with Grilled Tofu.  My friend ordered a salad and asked to substitute the chicken for tofu.  They salad guy said \"what?  Oh no, we don't have any of that.\"  My friend pointed out what it says on the menu and he frantically ran around shouting \"Do we have tofu, do we have tofu?\"  Nobody else knew what he was talking about so he came back and said \"no we don't have tofu.\"  My friend again pointed out that the menu says they have it and he again asked a couple of people and said \"no sorry, I don't know why the menu says that.\" The woman at the cash register confirmed that they do have tofu.\n\n4.  Cosi Card - they have a Cosi card which you can get if you ask for it.  I asked the cashier for it one day after my transaction and he gave me one.  I asked why he didn't ask if I had a card before my purchase and he said \"oh, we aren't trained to ask before a purchase.\"  Dumb.  Dumb.  Also, why can't I use my phone # when I come back to get credit for my purchase.  Why do I physically have to carry my card around instead of being able to give my phone number like most rewards programs?\n\n5.  Tables dirty - usually\n\n6.  Agree with another review - they will have a guy rolling out bread when there are 10 people in line.  Shouldn't that be done during downtime?\n\n7.  They people behind the counter don't look up.  They'll stand there with a line of people seemingly not noticing that people are waiting to order.\n\nI could go on.  Unfortunately, we moved into the Bourse Building across from Cosi 4 months ago and Cosi is the closest place where I can get a decent salad so I and my co-workers go there more than we would like.  The food inside the Bourse Building is pretty bad.  \n\nThe food at Cosi is generally good, I just really wish they would get their act together Operationally.

I like that they have the calories listed on the menu and I like the combo option (1/2 salad and 1/2 sandwich).  \n\nDecent alternative to regular fast food.  I like the Cosi Club and I seem to be addicted to the Diet Lemonade.", "date": "2012-08-21 02:46:46", "user": {"name": "Mary", "review_count": 109, "yelping_since": "2010-10-04 00:52:50", "elite": "2012,2013,2014,2015,2016", "average_stars": 4.0, "fans": 17}}

This is the first time I ever walked into this chain and I thought I would give it a try. BTW, is it a philly thing that all foods must have their calories listed? It's a really nice deterrent to eating the foods I actually want!\n\nI spent like 10 min at the cashier trying to decide on what I wanted given their large selection of items that sounded good. Pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, various tasty drinks.... I finally settled on the Tandoori chicken sandwich. um... DERICIOUS! The strawberry smoothie? DERICIOUS!\n\nI didn't get the impression that the service was terrible, but maybe all the other Cosi's had outstanding service! They bring the food to your table and they quickly run out of space to sit during their lunch rush... so rush your booty over early.", "date": "2012-08-18 17:04:32", "user": {"name": "Eric", "review_count": 1710, "yelping_since": "2008-08-08 18:05:19", "elite": "2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.13, "fans": 204}}

Fnally someone will come up... \"Are you being helped?\" DUH!! After I finally order, I wait and wait, I see my ticket hanging up..then I wait some more...this last time, the manager smoked a FULL CIGARETTE, came back in & saw my ticket still hadn't even been touched yet... he asked his staff what I was waiting for still? He made my salad himself while the brat behind the counter tells him she didn't see it... After being late from break about 3 times and especially this last time, I will not return.
