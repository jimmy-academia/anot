First we started off with Malpeque and some other non-Louisiana raw oysters. Delcious! Then I had the fried oyster and avocaldo salad. Again, delicious! Then I had the gourmet Luke burger and pommes frites which I shared with a fellow group member for half of her croque monsieur. The burger was much better than I thought it would be and the croque monsieur was fabulous. I also sampled the onion tart/pie/pizza looking item - it was very, very tasty. Might have been the best tasting item on the table!!!\n\n-----\n\nUpdate: Breakfast at Luke, 8/12/07\n\nConstruction is finally finished so you no longer have to go through the hotel lobby to get to restaurant. I love how the day's oyster selection 'greets' you on the bar as you walk in. Front dining room is very nice for a bistro-style place. I had the two poached eggs on crispy crab cakes with ham and the blood orange screwdriver. The crab cakes were simply perfect! Great crunch, very well seasoned, went perfectly with the poached eggs, ham and hollandaise sauce. Yummy!\n\n-----\n\nA recent addition to the scene, Luke is John Besh's new bistro style restaurant. \n\nThe place is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but I've only been there for lunch a couple of times so far. If you like oysters, they have Louisiana oysters, but also Belon and Malpeque (selection varies) on the half shell as well. \n\nI don't think the word is out yet on this spot as it has been nearly empty every time I have dined there, but I have had some good cochon de lait and croque monsieur there on a recent decadent lunch there with a foodie friend. In fact, we had some much food there for lunch, we had to 'watch' dinner on TV that night!\n\nOne of my favorite new places, definitely worth a visit!", "date": "2007-07-17 20:14:30"}

I balked much because I had alot to do for school but the guilt in me wouldnt let me turn this invitation down.\n\nTo listen to my cousin complain about work and to eat great food.\n\nThe restaurant is attached to the Hilton and so really there is no seperate parking lot.  As it is located in the Central Business District, parking off-street and paying by meter is one option or you can park at many of the pay by the hour parking lots in the area and walk over.\n\nThe place reminds me a bit about the Palace Cafe.  The no-fuss design of the bar, the tables and chairs.  It was all very country French bistro.\n\nAt any rate, I got there first and was told to wait by the bar for the other person, so I went and sat in front of the guy adjacent to the bar---the oyster shucker guy.\n\nHe had his own thing going own.  I asked him what it was that he had going on down below the bar.  I leaned across the bar to look and saw 6 compartments he was keeping fresh ice around.\n\nLobster tails, spiny lobster crab legs, squid, mussels, clams and lemons.  \n\nI ordered a gin and tonic and chatted up with the oyster shucker.  Pretty soon, he hooked me up with 4 different oysters---Hootenanny, Malbec, P&G, and some Canadian oysters --cant remember the name (it was french that much I do recall.)\n\nAll good and shucker asked which was my fave.  My reply was the Washington State Hootenanny.  Good stuff.\n\nBy that time, my cousin came and so we were seated.\n\nI had the Baked Oysters with bacon.  It was ok.  The Matzo ball and chicken soup was great.  The fried oyster sald with apple bacon reminded me of Palace Cafe.\n\nAll good\n\nMy cousin had a prix fixe meal.  For only 21 bucks, he had his choice of soup, an entree, and a dessert.  Cannot beat that.  His blanquette of veal was wonderful.  Cooked down, it was so tender, you dont even need a knife to cut anything--the pieces break off so easily.  It was wonderful.  Im going to have to get that next time, but only on Thursday night for dinner.\n\nHere is a link to their menus:\n\nhttp://www.lukeneworleans.com/menus/menus.html\n\nThe service was good and I had to warn my cousin to keep his mouth shut or else I would never go to another restaurant with him again.  You see, he is a chef and so he's always so critical at other restaurants and when he's not happy, he's quick to tell the server.  \n\nAt any rate, it was all great and the food was well worth the price.  I didnt feel overdressed--it ranged, but definitely no short shorts and flip-flops.\n\nReservations are recommended.", "date": "2008-03-08 23:36:58"}

I did the right thing, because I never would have come up with what I received by looking over the menu.  My entree - lightly roasted vegetables over perfectly seasoned spetzel(!).  Beets, turnips, green beans, asparagus, and tomatoes on top.

The strawberry shortcake (assumedly seasonal with local berries, and not on the menu) and chocolate-filled puff pastries also received much accolade.  \n\nService here was great.

We decided to give Luke a try for a change of pace and because we wanted to see whether a John Besh restaurant actually lives up to the hype.  In a couple words: hell yes!\n\nOur meals consisted of the following:\n\n* \"Le Plateau\" of jumbo Louisiana Shrimp (1/2 dozen): Humangous shrimp that were juicy and oh so fresh.  It saddens me how Chicago's seafood can not even begin to compare to what the folks down in New Orleans get to eat.\n\n* Pate of Louisiana rabbit and duck livers: I developed a newfound appreciation for/obsession with pate from my trip to Paris last year.  Luke's pate was absolutely phenomenal.  The pate is served in a little jar and comes with an assortment of garnishes as well as some \"country bread croutons\".  After we went through the first batch of croutons, we got a second helping and proceeded to polish that off too.  That's how good the pate was.  \n\n* Moules et Frites: A French bistro staple, Luke's version of it did not disappoint.  First off, the portions are absolutely massive and the mussels themselves are ridiculously plump and fresh.  Our server taught us a little trick on how to use the mussel shells as pinchers for removing the meat -- so clever and effective!  The mussel broth made for a perfect dipping sauce for the frites.  Terrific dish and yet another reminder of how New Orleans seafood kicks major ass.\n\nI also got a cocktail called the French 75, which was basically cognac, lemon juice and champagne.  Very refreshing on a hot muggy day!\n\nService was terrific -- friendly and polite, what one would expect dining in the South.  Prices were very reasonable and the ambiance is relaxing and inviting, which I much preferred over the rowdiness that one might find while dining at a restaurant on Bourbon St.  All in all, it was a fantastic meal.

I went on Thursday because I like veal and a yelper said that would be the special. My lunch cost $20.00, including tax and ice tea. The bread was hot and fresh and they must put something in the butter because it was real good. The crawfish bisque came highly recommended and it was a good idea. A little seafoody, if you know what I mean, but since it was seafood I guess that was right. The veal was unbelievable! It fell apart and was just fatty enough to make it perfect. It came on a bed of home made pasta that was great and with roasted green beans and small carrots. The lunch special (entree and soup) was $15 and I think the dinner special was $21 for entree, soup, and desert. Check their website (link in another yelp review) for daily specials. Such a great meal that I'm planning on bringing my wife to NOLA in the near future for a few days and this meal made me decide to do it soon. Setting was great, atmosphere was superb, service was exceptional, food was five star - without a doubt. I've given a few 5 stars for atmosphere and unique food - but this is a REAL five star restaurant with a three star price. From Canal, it's one block from Bourbon and about two blocks off Canal.

I can appreciate rich food, as a New Orleanian, but found Luke to be deplorable. Excess grease aside, the food suffered from a lack of cohesion within the plates.

Curiously there was a stuffed crawfish shell in the soup, but no seafood fork or finger bowl was provided as means to make possible the consumption of that morsel. As my main course I ate the jumbo Gulf shrimp and grits, and while I found the grits very enjoyable, the only flavors on the plate were spice, spice and more spice, which totally obliterated any chance that the Gulf shrimp's subtle flavors might shine. Fortunately for me, the dessert that followed was certainly a high point in my week. I ordered the Banana Cream Profiteroles, and was truly impressed by the rich flavor of the banana cream, contrasted with the concentrated flavor of the Foster's sauce, it was all very lovely.

I had a cup of the crab and corn bisque and a Veal Entree. All were wicked delicious.  \n\nThey have a really good lunchtime deal where you can get a cup of soup and the entree for the day for $15.  The atmosphere and service were both lovely.  Will definitly return next time I'm there and would recommend it to everyone.", "date": "2008-10-23 20:29:52"}

Alsatian food is great, but badly underappreciated in the US.  John Besh, I salute you.\n\nLike Lilette, you get a real bistro feel here.  The decor is perfect.  We came in late one night for what amounted to a second dinner and liked it so much, we came back for lunch 2 days later.\n\nThe dishes:\n\nSalad of chicory, lardons of Allen Benton's bacon croutons and soft poached yard egg with creole mustard and tarragon.  Delicious - not too heavy, but the bacon gives it a great nuance. \n\nFries - these need a separate mention.  They're absolutely perfect - crunchy with a strong potato flavor.  Superb!\n\nMoules et frites - the Belgians should be worried about their dominance with this dish, as Luke's is terrific.  Nice traditional broth with chives and just a little bit of cream.  Slurpable!\n\nShrimp farci with blood orange hollandaise, crabmeat and shrimp - I wasn't sure what this was (should've asked about the meaning of 'farci'), but took a small gamble.  They chop up the shrimp and crabmeat, then bread it and fry it.  That hollandaise really makes this dish - it's lovely.\n\nI thought about giving Luke 4 stars, but that would be ungenerous - it's great.", "date": "2008-10-28 03:17:29"}

I have tried EVERYTHING on the menu at least twice so I think I have a pretty good basis for comparison.  \n\nThis restaurant is not for everyone.  If you are new in town and looking for classic New Orleans creole or soul food cuisine.  Look elsewhere.  If you don't like Alsacian food (or don't know what it is) you might want to pass.  But if you are game you will find Luke serves earthy food with a light touch.  \n\nLiterally everything is good, but there are standouts.  The Luke Burger is made of fine beef and served with fries that I believe are cooked in duck fat.  It is the tastiest combo in town.  Although it's great, I don't often get the burger because it weighs about 5 pounds.  You will need a doggy bag.\n\nI do get the matzo ball soup and Luke salad often.  The soup is a rarity in NOLA and I'll admit that I don't get the connection of this Jewish staple to the French/German border.  Who cares?  It tastes a little like chicken gumbo, which means it's delicious.  \n\nThe redfish is probably the best all-around dish.  It's lightly sauteed and covered in lump crab meat .  However, my personal favorite is the Flamenkuche aka German pizza or bacon, Emmenthaler and caraway cheese and onions on a tarte.  This dish is savory and so good that I sometimes dream about it.  \n\nAt the risk of belaboring the point, there are plenty of other standouts.  The redfish court-bouillion.  The white bean and duck cassoulet.  The cochon de lait.  Did I mention they put on a fine breakfast?  Grits and grillades.  Buttermilk pancakes.  Etc. Etc.\n\nThe service is friendly and attentive.  The decor is cool and very detailed.  Note the old fashion belt fans in the front room (I didn't notice them until my 10th visit.)\n\nJust check the restaurant out.  It's got plenty to offer.  I hope you will agree.", "date": "2009-05-08 05:28:12"}

The portion of gumbo wasn't very big, but it was filled with seafood, including a whole chunk of shell-on crab in the middle.  The sandwich was much bigger, and featured some of the best sandwich bread I've ever had - very crispy yet buttered thoroughly.  The meat was tender though a teeny bit dry - I got over this by slathering copious amounts of delicious cherry mustard onto it.  The sandwich came with cones of hot and crispy fries.\n\nService is very good.  When we told them we were splitting the food, they split the sandwich and fries for us in the kitchen so we got separate plates.

And as usual in the New Orleans CBD - parking is a bitch, or expensive. but nevermind that -\n\nLuke is one of John Besh's restaurants - he seems to be taking over the restaurant scene nowdays - think a casual French bistro complete with newspaper racks, wood tables, knives and forks wrapped in kitchen linen - the windows also bring in a good amount of sunlight so coming in to eat lunch here it becomes a bright spot. However the way the restaurant is with the front and there's a back open entrance to the lobby/kitchen/whatever if you sit in the back tables you can catch a nasty draft. \n\nI'm a big fan of the wild boar and also the rabbit pate - they come in these jars and crostinis - however once in a while I'll get one that feels like it has been in a refrigerator on the highest cold setting and it gets kind of a real hard consistency - but for the most part - creaminess. They also have a charcuterie plate, soups such as gumbo, a matzo ball soup (which is pretty much vegetable stock and a dumpling). \n\nFor lunch they also offer specials - I think it's a cup of soup and an entree for about 20 bucks - they serve up different choices each day.\n\nI got the Luke burger - which is just a great burger. I feel kind of dumb getting it a lot but sometimes nothing beats a well cooked burger for lunch. My friend got the mussels which come in this huge cast iron pot (cheap - 17 bucks i think?) - I also tried the shrimp and grits, which is kind of a smothered in this rosemary sauce - extremely rich. There's also the shrimp farci which I think is one of their best dishes - shrimp stuffed with crabmeat over this extremely rich blood orange hollandaise. They also have a pretty big raw bar - with crab legs, fresh oysters, etc.\n\nSo food is on point.\n\nService however - every time I came in here the servers seemed kind of aloof - one in particular I had on my recent trip - she had extremely bad breath (I think every server should be carrying a pack of mints if they're working all day) and neglected to tell my friend that they charge for every refill on soda - my friends drank about 3 diet cokes each - so they were charged 18 bucks for refills. Now in New Orleans, people love their Coca colas so it's kind of odd to see a restaurant such as Luke to not have free refills - however I feel like the server should have said something about that. Service is on point with the time and food - but the apathetic moods kind of turns me off a little. At least fake a smile. \n\nI frequent this spot for lunch - Luke is open early for breakfast and is open late (I think 11 pm?) However with better options for dinner I'll just keep Luke as a lunch spot.", "date": "2009-07-11 09:26:18"}

It was so good, that he \"knew I should stop but I couldn't\".  He's had many croque monsieurs in his lifetime but \"this was the best!\"  I had the veal cheeks with mushroom and pasta.  The meat was so tender but not fatty, and flavorful.  This place is a must if you're tired of the mediocre food of touristy restaurants off Bourbon street.", "date": "2009-09-27 23:26:43"}

We had a reservation for dinner, but waited for at least 15 minutes for our table to be prepared.   Once at the table we waited more for a server.  The drink/wine/beer list is interesting and unusual, we all had questions, but the waitress seemed rushed and disappeared.  We finally got our drink order in and waited again for our drinks to arrive.  Seemed understaffed. \n\nOur soups arrived without spoons.  More time wasted flagging down a waiter serving another group to get spoons.   Don't bother with the crab & corn bisque - there's no crab in it, about 5 kernels of corn and watery.  \n\nNice selection of Belgian and German beers.  Wine pours are small.  Prices seem reasonable at first glance, but portions are relatively small by American standards.  Steaks are thin.  Friend's burger was over done.  Fries were cold (really unexcusable, at least get that right...)  I had the veal cheeks which had a nice smoky flavor, but they were swimming in a watery, not very mushroomy flavored sauce.  \n\nInstead of before or with the apps, bread was served between apps and main course and barely warm.  The little crock of butter was sloppily prepared and messy to handle.  Butter all over everybody's fingers.  Just another little annoying thing that gives an indication of attention to detail.\n\nServing the burgers on a cutting board is a clever gimmick, but they looked a bit worn and I started thinking \"dirty cutting board\" probably not the best presentation idea.  \n\nBread pudding dessert was very good.\n\nAll in all, I can't really recommend Luke, there's better places in NO for the money.  Not close to \"Iron Chef\" material, for sure.\n\nWould have given it 3 stars, but Yelp says 3 stars is \"A-OK\" and Luke was not, at least on this night.

First night I went at 9 on a Monday and they were apparently cleaning up for the night and had little regard for the patrons. As a rather surly and obscene blond walked into the restaurant cursing I was disappointed to find out that was one of the bartenders. I sat at the bar and ordered \"THE\" burger and their house amber. OOOPS they were out of their own stock brew.  As I mentioned the place was near empty and yet it took a full 20 plus minute for my burger and fries to arrive.  And when it did I still had to ask for silverware and salt and pepper.  Actually I reached over the bar and got it myself because if I was going to wait for the bartender it would have been a long wait. Fries while supposed to be spectacular fell flat as they were as cold and old as a gutter cigarette butt.  The burger was served on a cutting board and I agree with another reviewer, this is gross. The burger that is so highly touted comes on an untoasted slightly chilled old roll. Sad. The meat was cooked medium on half of the burger and rare to raw on the other. While the meat was gently prepared and tender it was not particularly flavorful. The bartender said smugly \"How's that burger?\" I replied \"I've had better\" She looked at me like I had three heads instead of asking how she could improve my experience. After she splashed me with bar water a few times during her sloppy nightly cleanup ritual I paid and left. \nI found myself 3 blocks away with friends the next night and they were looking for a final meal. I felt I owed it t John Besh to give Luke a second try. MISTAKE. We sat in the back and I have to say our server was excellent in every way. I am sorry I don't recall her name. Sadly the food missed the mark again. I ordered the pressed couchon sandwich which was warmish in the outside with cold guts. My mates had the rib-eye which was not appropriately charred which led to a big pile of mushy fat left on his plate. A Luke burger and the couchon special rounded out the foursome. Yawn.

It was SO good, that we ordered another one (just three of us!!!)!!!!. Some Malpeque Oysters (of course) then the Fried Oyster and Avocado salad (delicious)! My Ribeye was perfectly done as was the Bread Pudding w/ Vanilla Ice Cream. Needless to say I was fat, happy and feeling pregnant after that dinner! But it was SOOO good. \n\nKudos to Luke for having a mignonette sauce available in addition to cocktail sauce (both occasions). Place does get pretty packed for dinner more so than lunch, so make reservations!", "date": "2009-12-14 15:22:40"}

I'm a fan of the hotel/bank decor, but slippery stone floors and a tipsy rain-soaked me was not a good combination. \n\nWe sat at a table and immediately ordered wine and appetizers: the rabbit and duck liver pate and a roast beet salad. My Bellini was great, with the fresh peach really resonating, but Daniel was unsatisfied with his wine (it came in a tumbler like Italian wine... weird). \n\nThe pate was the hit of the night! So smooth and rich and buttery, accompanied with Creole mustard, tiny pickles, and 2 fruit relishes on buttery crisp toast. INCREDIBLE. We literally scraped the cute little glass container out. Restaurant August needs to take a tip on pate from Luke because this was seriously superior.\n\nFor an entree we shared the moules and frites. Amazing fries, fresh and hot, and a great creamy buttery garlic broth with the mussels (although a few were shriveled and overcooked). At this point we were happily satiated and thus declined dessert... and still, dinner was only $60! \n\nI've come before for the oysters and they are great and ESPECIALLY reasonable for happy hour.

We were greeted by a hostess who looked at us as though we had just killed her cat, and our waiter seemed like he had a thousand things he'd rather be doing than waiting tables. They weren't particularly busy, but our waiter seemed occupied with doing anything but his job. I don't always like my job either, but after the third time I'd asked for a water refill and was absolutely parched, I had to wonder what he was up to when he kept vanishing. \nDespite the terrible service, my food was delicious. The Bloody Marys had just enough kick. I ordered the fried oyster, bacon and avocado salad to start, and the oysters were perfection (although the dressing was a bit heavy). My entree was the Croque Madame, and the crispy edges were heavenly. The middle got a bit soggy with all the cheese and a little much mustard, but overall I was happy. One of my dining companions had the Crawfish Bisque, which was one of the worst things I've ever eaten. Imagine a cup of heavy cream mixed with pepper. No crawfish flavor, terrible seasoning and entirely too heavy. Nothing like what my grandmother used to make. The same dining companion had a particularly unfortunate meal, as she ordered the crab omelet. All I can say here is that cucumber, crab and eggs do not belong on the same fork. \nThe third diner in our party had some better luck with the seafood gumbo (good, not amazing), a nice crab salad and some sort of onion bacon tart thing that was divine in small portions, but a bit heavy overall. Fries were served cold. Not lukewarm, cold. \nI thought it might be an off day and was ready to forgive the bad service until a bartender popped open a bottle of champagne and the cork grazed my head (I was sitting about 20 feet from the bartender in question), and no one seemed to care. \nOur waiter resurfaced at the end of the meal to ask how things were, we told him we were finished, and no less than 20 minutes later he returned to again ask how we were doing. Check please? He wandered off not to be seen again for 10 minutes, and we entertained ourselves watching the hostess wander from her post then sprint back across the restaurant every time the phone rang. Professional. Really. Add some bizarre, disjointed decor and the overall atmosphere almost ruined my food. I've eaten at a few other Besh restaurants and have never been disappointed until now. I want to believe that this was a bad day, but as the best service we received all day was from the valet at the Hilton next door, I don't see myself returning.", "date": "2009-12-27 20:18:16"}

I gonna stick with vodka from now on. On to the appetizers \n\n1.) Raw oysters (P&J, Komomotos, and locals) delicious and fresh served on a tray of crushed ice. These morsels are sweet and meaty. And with a spicy cocktail sauce delicious. \n2.) Mussels steamed were good but on the small size, not as meaty as I would of liked. \n3.) Clams steamed in a nice sauce, but again on the small size, barely got the clam taste after one bite and done. \n4.) Gumbo that had a rich and flavorful rue, oh that was GOOD... \n5.) Assiette de charcuterie, for the less sophisticated a plate of pate, sliced sausage, and other delicious meats. A country bread crispy toasted, and sliced thin like a cracker. Wonderful flavors and textures to the pates. The hogs head cheese was spectacular. And the grainy mustard's and pickles, together on the bread just exploded in your mouth. \n6.) Flamenkuche you ask? No this isn't a foul word its a pork belly pizza with sauteed onions and some damn delicious sauce. And it's served on a flat crispy pizza cracker. Oh my god this kicks ASS. \nMoving on to the salads we start to feel a bit full, but that won't stop us yet. \n\nSalad Luke was concocted of bibb lettuce, cucumbers, beets, and a buttermilk dressing. Very tasty and fresh. \nRoasted beet salad was just that delicious beets with toasted pistachios. I really enjoyed the crunch with the beets, nice offset. \n\nEverything we ordered turned out great, and the service was excellent. They times our orders so that we had plenty of room on the table.

The Emmenthaler cheese is SWEET.  And I think that's what makes the flamenk\u00fcche (yeah, try pronouncing it) work, the combination of sweet and savory made my tummy happy but at $13, it was only a slightly overpriced tease compared to the amazing pork special I dived into next.  That dish is big, succulent and at $15, probably the best value of any one entree I had all week in New Orleans.  The pork is resting on top of crab and  crawfish stuffed cornbread that layers the bottom of the plate so it almost resembles a casserole, or a Thanksgiving stuffing.  In between the pork and the stuffed cornbread is a generous heaping of greens (kale? spinach?  whatever it was, it tasted great mixed with the sauce from the pork).  \n\nThe burger on the other hand ... one of the more expensive items on the menu at $16, we both were expecting more, especially after reading the newspaper clippings lining the inside of the restaurant that all raved about this one item in particular.  Sure, it was big and pretty, but the meat really lacked any distinct flavor.  It was kind of bland, and the spatzle my girl friend opted for on the side was even worse.  Our waiter was kind enough to throw in a complimentary order of pommes frites (\"because they really are so good\") that were also under-seasoned but which I happily devoured anyway.  Basically, you don't go to a John Besh restaurant and order a burger anyway, right?  SO don't follow our strategy either.\n\nService: Our waiter was very conversational and a fellow foodie lover.  We even got to talking about great places to eat in Manhattan.  I just wish we spent more time talking about that damn spatzle because the way he described it to my girl friend was totally off.  We had never had the German staple before, so we were surprised to see what looked like macaroni salad on our table instead of the gnocchi he promised us in the totally inaccurate description.  \n\nAtmosphere: A real classy joint that is connected to the Hilton on the border between the French Quarter and the business district.  Every plate is served on top of a wooden carving board, which kind of blends the whole upscale American and hearty German atmosphere as well. There is a full bar also, and happy hour is a must (25 cent oysters and half off drinks and beers).  It feels like a place where business people go to enjoy themselves after a long day of work, checking their briefcases at the revolving door.  I guess you could compare it to the Wall Street crowd in Manhattan, although it's STILL New Orleans we're talking about, so don't worry about it being too stuffy in there.\n\nValue: As I mentioned earlier, I really do believe for the quality and quantity of food, Luke is a great value if you stick to the specials.  Happy Hour is one of those great specials, even if you don't like oysters (down a Sazerac or two) and for dinner, they offer 3-course specials at $23 a pop.  Not bad at all, and I heard super things about their chicken and matzah ball soup (one of the 3-course options to start).

Bread was timely, coffee and water refills spot on, plate descriptions accurate thorough, and all done with a friendly down-to-earth demeanor and a smile.  Going over the daily special with me I was left to decide while he went to get my coffee.\n\nListening to the room - lively but not loud despite the parade going by in the street - I labored over the menu for some time because everything sounded quite good - essentially bistro fare with a southern twist.  Returning with the coffee - a great thick blend with a bit of chicory but more prominently cocoa notes (I'm rather certain the same as that at August) I decided to go with the \"express lunch\" special - a $15 soup and main combo plus an added appetizer.  Smiling my server told me I'd made a great choice and slipped away to serve his other tables.\n\nArriving shortly after my order was placed - yet another crispy and golden French loaf, this time served with a delightful and grassy salted butter.  While the bread was not quite as delicious as that at Clancy's it was my second favorite of the trip and the butter put it over the top - thankfully I limited myself to just the one loaf because it turns out Luke's \"deal\" lunch is not for the faint of heart (or stomach.)\n\nArriving first, my soup - the daily special of crawfish bisque.  Clearly tomato and cream based with heavy spicing and ample crawfish the dish was unlike any bisque I've ever tasted, but certainly not a gumbo either.  Loaded with chunks of fresh crawfish and spicy without being \"hot\" I liked the bisque and as it would turn out (oddly) to be my only experience with crawfish on the trip I was glad I'd chosen it even though I likely would have preferred the daily gumbo.\n\nMy second dish, an addition to the prix fixe, was the Foie Gras - quite frankly, if a place is offering a terrine of Foie I'm probably going to order it.  Presented elegantly this terrine proved not only good, but exemplary.  Featuring a thick cut of slow cooked terrine painted on all sides with a Gew\u00fcrztraminer reduction, topped with micro greens and a coarse sea salt, and drizzled with thick and sweet balsamic I can favorably compare this $16 preparation to the $30 supplemented version served at The French Laundry - though it wasn't quite as airy or delicate.   Served with toasted brioche (I was brought more on request) and beautifully textured I would strongly recommend any fan of cold foie to visit Luke for the experience.\n\nArriving next was the daily special - having looked at the menu I was surprised when it arrived because I expected a sandwich...but the surprise was the good kind...the really good kind.  In describing their cochon du lait prep my server told me how the slow roast pork is reduced down similar to pulled pork and then \"rehydrated\" with a dairy, onion, and garlic reduction (plus the chef's special spices) and then pan fried crispy on top.  If that description doesn't do it for you - try it...almost a sweet yet creamy pork meatloaf with a crispy and salty skin akin to pork belly.  Accompanying the pork on the plate were not only the advertised stewed greens and vinegar laden cherry mustard, but also a hefty helping of cornbread dressing.  Call it bistro food, call it soul food, call it comfort food - I call it one of the most unexpectedly delicious dishes I've had in some time.\n\nAsking me if I was interested in dessert I told him I didn't even need the menu - just bring the bread pudding.\n\nArriving about 15 minutes later as I read a complimentary copy of the New York Times the bread pudding was an absolute masterpiece - the best traditional bread pudding I've ever tasted.  Described simply as cinnamon raisin bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce the complexities of the dish were astounding for a bread pudding - piping hot with the smooth and creamy ice cream slowly melting the bread pudding itself was marvelous in custard/bread ratio and the sauce had minimal alcoholic kick while instead focusing on notes of caramel, pecan, cinnamon, and what may have even been honey.  Having had a whole lot of bread pudding in my time this was undoubtedly my favorite non-chocolate version to date.", "date": "2010-02-24 14:20:24"}

First of all, it's a John Besh restaurant, and I have grown to love his food in this city.

I've been here at least 5 times, and I have 3 more weeks to add to that number. \n\nMy favorite thing to do is go for their Happy Hour, which is a little known gem. Between the hours of 3p-6p daily, they have the best $.25 oysters. You just have to order them by 6pm, and you'll probably wait quite a while before they arrive on your table. It's worth the wait, because these are the best value you'll find in all of town. Share some oysters and the appetizers (rabbit and goose livers, the flamenkuche, foie gras terrine). As for the entrees, depending on your mood, I would recommend the cochon de lait or the croque monsieur if you want a sandwich or the shrimp grits if you want southern comfort food. One of the daily dinner specials is a pork dish over andoille cornbread stuffing. I don't know about the pork, but the cornbread can be ordered as a side (if it's the right day) and it's really, really good. The great thing about this place is how laid back and chill it is. The service is usually spot on too. \n\nLast tip, so you don't say I just repeated other reviews: My friends and I figured out how to make the sandwiches EVEN better. Ready? Take the pate and spread it in the cochon de lait. OMG it is sooo good. We told the waiter to recommend that to John Besh, but we're not sure if the message ever got there.

This is hands down a great restaurant. \n\nI wnt to Luke for lunch and sat at the bar with the regular mid-week lunch crowd.  lI enjoyed three courses: salad, soup, and entre.  This was coupled with three local beers.\n\nThe salad was a Slow poached egg with\nChicory, Bacon, Crispy fried pigs ear, with a Mustard dressing. This was a unique and tasty poached egg salad.  The bacon was especially good, with a rich, smokey flavor.  The fried pigs ears were tender and suculent.  \n\nThe soup was a signature crawfish bisque.  This was by far the best crawfish dish I've experienced, aside from a straight boil.  The bisque was so full of crawfish flavor, but not heavy or weighed down by butter or cream.  The bisque was acompanyed by a crawfish head filled with a delicate stuffing that, when drenched in bisque, melted in the mouth.  I was told that this was seasonal based on the availability of quality crawfish.  A must-try if available.\n\nFinally, the entre. Being lunch and as an out of towner, I kept the crawfish theme going with a Luisianna \"crawfish boil\" po-boy.   The sanwich came on a thick French roll, layered with slices of green tomatoes and hard boiled eggs, a signature slaw, and creol seasoned boiled crawfish tails.  While the bread was a tad thick, the flavor of the slaw, tomatoes, and crawfish was perfect.  The sandwich was acompanyed by a healthy portion of frites. \n\nOverall this was an excellent meal and great experience.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly.

Some guys (late 20s) in the group ordered the Mint Julep, they hated it. I had the French 75, that actually came in a cognac glass.

I then started with the crawfish bisque, salty but delicious. Entree for me was the crabmeat ravioli. It started out tasting a little funny, but as I ate more I started to really enjoy it. What bothered me about that dish is the fact that the raviolis were all stuck together (the skin) but broken apart in the middle and all the stuffing was everywhere. My boyfriend had the ribeye with crabmeat on top (served on a cutting board). I think the ribeye would have been pretty average if it weren't for the delicious crab meat. For sides, I had the sauteed local vegetable, too oily but tasted good. My boyfriend had the fries that were really good but salty. I tried our friend's asparagus and it was good. \n\nThe service was SLOW and unattentive.

She told our friend that she's never had a black guy before and she heard that once you go black you don't go back...wtf..haha...she was at our table whispering to him for like 15 minutes before we had to get the server to tell her to leave. She was friends with all the servers and busboys in the restaurant so maybe she work(s)(ed) there(???)

Is THIS what it took to get me out of my Yelp coma?!  Seeing as Luke has been the only antidote for my horribly shameful MIA status, I should have ventured over to New Orleans sooner!  Should I ever return to that crazy, pothole infested city, you can bet that I will fall all over myself to eat at Luke again!  \n\nFirst, I must say that our server, Al from NY, was like the BEST server I have ever had EVER!  Major props.  He was extremely attentive, but not stuck up our butts the whole time, you know?  His recommendations were precisely what I hoped for, and he knew to steer us clear of the things we weren't hoping for (ie: the brontosaurus leg sized pork dish that looked delicious on the menu, but when another guy at our table ordered it, I was very grateful that Al took the liberty of suggesting it was probably not a dish fit for a hamster...and he was right).  Anyway, we were all very impressed by the awesome service.  Later, the GM came by to check on us and make sure everything was to our liking.  Affirmative.\n\nI had to try the Schneider beer, because well, it's practically my maiden name.  I am happy to report that I taste pretty delicious!  Everyone else's beer that I sampled tasted great too.  It's hard to ever go wrong with beer...especially when it has your name on it!\n\nFor the entree, I ended up getting the amazingly juicy duck confit with white bean something or other deliciousness with crispy pork belly treasures and the most flavorful sausage I've ever put in my mouth.  Freakin' good!  It had whole pieces of garlic!!!  They sure know how to win my heart!  One thing I noticed is that this place really knows how to cook meat to perfection: fall of the bone, melt in your mouth, juicy and tasty.  I tasted some of my friend's red fish, and it was also a real winner, but in the end I'm glad I committed to the duck confit.  \n\n75 dollars later (2 entrees and 2 beers + tax & tip), I left Luke feeling the giddiest I've felt in months.  Completely satisfied, slightly buzzed, a relaxed time with friends and great service makes for a perfect evening.  Life is good.  The only thing I regret is not saving room for dessert.  After stuffing myself silly with their fresh, baguette style bread and butter, entree and sampling friend's dishes, I was more than full...let's not go overboard and then spoil the moment by having to scout out the nearest drugstore for some Tums.\n\nNext time...there's always next time!", "date": "2010-06-21 05:46:27"}

A mix of casual yet classy, modern yet vintage, with Southern hospitality ever present and food and drinks that delight the senses. I was floored.\n\nWhile everything on the menu looked tantalizing, three out of four of us decided to get their daily changing 3-course Express Menu for $23. Best decision ever. I had crawfish bisque as my soup selection, and it was fantastic - a yummy little crawfish with its tiny head poking out of a delicious pool of flavorful bisque. The Friday dinner special was a Redfish \"Court-Bouillon\" with crab, shrimp, oysters and rice served in a skillet. The generous portions of seafood tasted so fresh, and the cajun sauce was so delicious that I polished off my entire plate with my bread. For dessert, we had Brendan's bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce which was heaven in a bowl. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert, and L\u00fcke surely blew away my tastebuds with it. And all this for ONLY $23!!\n\nL\u00fcke's classic New Orleans cocktails were also made to perfection.

My boyfriend and I had a 7:30 reservation, and were surprised to see a good number of children in the restaurant.  This was by no means a bad thing, though, and reflected on the casual, welcoming atmosphere of the place.  The decor was simple and relaxed, with lots of brown wood and an open kitchen.  We sat right outside of this kitchen and had a great view of the chefs preparing our food.\n\nThe service was so fabulous it deserves its own paragraph.  Our waitress was a wonderful friendly woman who made conversation without being intrusive and answered our questions with a smile on her face.  She was very attentive, checking in on us regularly throughout our dinner to make sure we were topped off with water and wine.  She also gave us great suggestions on what to order.\n\nThe food ranged from good to stellar.  The bread was a great start.  It came wrapped in a little towel like a delicious newborn baby, and it was warm and crusty and served with good butter.  We were starving, but still happy to wait for our orders with the help of this bread and a nice bottle of wine, which our waitress helped us select.\n\nFor our appetizers we got the assiette de charcuterie and the fried oyster, bacon, romaine, and avocado salad.  The charcuterie was really great, a substantial selection of meats served with stone-ground mustard, house-made pickles, and some tasty grilled country bread.  Almost everything on the plate was good.  The a pate of Louisiana rabbit and duck livers that was nice and creamy, with a forward livery flavor that I found rather welcome.  The pate en croute of local veal and pork came was pleasantly meaty and it came with some fantastic watermelon pickles.  My favorite was the rillete of Berkshire pork, which was rich, soft, and salty.  It came with an irresistible savory pear and ginger marmalade.  The one item I did not like was the Badischer presskopf, or hog's head cheese.  I don't think this was L\u00fcke's fault at all.  This was my first experience with head cheese, and I think it may be one of the few things I've tasted to which I have a categorical aversion.  I found the gelatin weird and the idea unappetizing.  The fried oyster salad was very tasty.  It was a filling salad, with a creamy dressing and chopped bacon on top.  The oysters were the star of the show, beautifully fried so that the breading added a nice crunch without disturbing the luscious oysterness within.\n\nFor our entrees I got the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend got the L\u00fcke burger.  The shrimp and grits - or, the jumbo Louisiana shrimp \"en cocotte\" with McEwen and Sons cream white corn grits and Poche's andouille - was out of control.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked, and each piece was firm and juicy.  The sauce on top reminded me of the sauce in barbecue shrimp, very butter and dark with some deep heat.  The grits were creamy like a great risotto, with little savory bits of sausage infusing it with flavor.  I don't think shrimp and grits gets any better.  I took a few bites of the L\u00fcke burger, and it was pretty decent, if not deserving of national acclaim.  This came topped with tomatoes, Allan Benton's bacon, caramelized onions, and Emmenthaler cheese.  The meat was good, as were all the individual components, but the burger didn't make my mouth water.  Neither did the side of housemade fries, which was disappointing.  They looked so good in their tall cone, but they were sadly limp.\n\nFor dessert we ordered Brendan's bread pudding, with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce, and the \"gateau basque,\" which was a vanilla cake with strawberries, simple syrup, and creole shrubb.  The bread pudding was good, but not the best in town.  I'd say the souffle at Commander's Palace and the bread pudding with whiskey sauce at Mr. B's were both better.  I liked the pecan sauce, but thought it would've been better with more pecan.  The \"gateau basque\" was the better dessert, very simple but with great flavor.  It had a really good crumb, too, like a cross between that of cake and cornbread, and the syrup moistened it up to great effect.\n\nOur dinner at L\u00fcke was a delightful experience, with warm service and some lip-smacking food - our waitress got a good tip and those shrimp and grits will be my standard for years to come.  If this restaurant were in my neighborhood I'd use it as a default for a nice but casual weekend dinner.  I also liked that the food was very New Orleans at heart, and I would recommend L\u00fcke to locals and tourists alike.", "date": "2010-06-29 19:20:58"}

Notably, Luke has their own microbrew beers that are designed by the same guy who designed Abita Amber.  It's some of the best beer in town and it's on tap only at Luke.\n\nThe staff at Luke is phenomenal.  They are serious about their jobs, there are a lot of staff members, they are pretty responsive to your needs.

They are very good and have only the best quality ingredients.  Other dishes are extremely rich as well. I have had every item on the menu several times--none of it is healthy but all good.\n\nBut the overlooked meal by Luke is breakfast.  They have homemade yogurt, some of the best Anson grits you will ever have, and some of the best coffee (served in a french press) with cream in the city of New Orleans.  Hands down it is one of the best coffees.  I like to just swing in during a tough day at work and indulge in coffee and fries.  \n\nThis is truly an underrated New Orleans restaurant.  Sure it's just a hotel bar and eatery.  But the food has a soul.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is upscale and yet relaxed.  I strongly recommend it as one of the better restaurants in the FQ area. \n\nOne side note: people complain about the prices at Luke.  They are about $5 too high for everything (eg. cheeseburger is $16, but it's a phenomenal burger that you'd definitely pay $11 for.)  \n\nThe restaurant has ample seating up front near the bar area.

I had the yard egg salad, which was pretty fantastic! My favorite part of the meal, by far. The way the egg explodes onto the greens with the crunch of crispy pig's ear... just amazing. The person who brought our salads was not our server and was very confused about who had ordered which salad, there seems to be a pretty serious lack of communication at Luke.\n\nEveryone enjoyed a different entree, and after a considerable wait, which is somewhat understandable considering how busy they were, they finally arrived. My mom had the mussels, which was stuffed to the brim, good quantity, although the flavor was fairly bland. It also came with fries which were COLD. My mom did send them back and after a bit of a wait, got a fresh batch. I had the duck confit, which I think was one of the best entrees, although it did come with some kind of fatty pork product that I passed off to my boyfriend which he happily ate. My boyfriend had the crispy pork belly and clams pasta, which was just fairly bland overall.

Luke has some of the best restaurant coffee I have ever tasted.\n\nAnother tip: Be mindful of the cheap oysters, appetizer and drink specials during Happy Hours throughout the week.\n\nMost importantly, it's not just the food that make this restaurant 5 star worthy... It's the cocktails. One cocktail in particular, actually. The French 75.\n\nI'm sure that their other cocktails are also good, but you will have to check that out for yourself. .\n\nYou see...\nLuke is where I fell in love with the French 75. And Luke's French 75 is the French 75 by which all French 75s will be judged through my lifetime.", "date": "2010-07-20 05:32:10"}

It is in the John Besh Restaurant Group, a French bistro with German influences (an homage to Kolb's, a long-standing German restaurant that was located in the CBD). L\u00fcke is moderately priced and offers something for all tastes (as long as you are not a vegetarian, but it is pescetarian friendly). The prices for lunch and dinner are similar, so it is an even better value for dinner than lunch.\n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the L\u00fcke burger- with Emmenthaler cheese, bacon, caramelized onions lettuce, tomato. This burger is HUGE- do not hesitate to split with another diner. The burger is accompanied with thin crispy fries served in a mint julep cup. If you split the burger, they will bring each diner his/her own cup! I used to work close to L\u00fcke, so I have eaten this burger too many times to count. It is my favorite hamburger in New Orleans.\n\nAnother favorite item on the menu is the flamenk\u00fcche- a thin tarte with caramelized onions, Emmenthaler cheese, and bacon. This Alsacien onion tarte satisfies all cravings- it is crispy, salty, sweet, creamy, and cheesy. It is a perfect appetizer to split among two people during happy hour, or between several people prior to a meal. Other starters of note are the pat\u00e9 of Louisiana rabbit and duck livers (brought in a small glass mason jar) and the slow poached yard egg salad.\n\nI have enjoyed many other items on L\u00fcke's menu, many of which are ideal for seafood lovers: the fresh gulf fish (my preference is served meuni\u00e8re), the crabmeat ravioli, and the moules et frites are all great choices. L\u00fcke has great daily specials. The Friday special, a redfish \"court-bouillon\" (a seafood stew served with rice) is my favorite and an excellent rendition of this classic Louisiana dish. There is also an extensive \"raw bar\" selection if you enjoy cold, fresh seafood.\n\nL\u00fcke also has an interesting wine selection (served in juice glasses, reminiscent of how people once enjoyed wine in their homes) and fantastic cocktails. If you enjoy bellinis, don't miss L\u00fcke's champagne au peche. Also, L\u00fcke serves the best French 75 in New Orleans- a perfect combination of cognac, lemon juice, and champagne, garnished with a brandied cherry. L\u00fcke's happy hour is a well-kept secret-  1/2 price drinks and .50 oysters from 3-6. Their oysters are always of exceptional quality- typically Louisiana oysters when available.\n\nWhether you are visiting New Orleans or a local, L\u00fcke is an excellent dining option.", "date": "2010-07-29 19:06:16"}

I visited this place under the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, and I ended up enjoying myself.  The shrimp \"en cocotte\" was well- cooked (with the most perfect McEwan and Sons grits of course).  The husband's jagerschnitzel was tasty but the gravy had an odd taste to it (I noticed ham bits - is that tasso?).  His meal included a soup and a dessert, which was a steal for $23.  The seafood gumbo tasted alright though the rice tasted old and dry. The profiteroles were a nice touch even when we were all stuffed by the end of the meal.  \n\nEuropean with a Cajun flair - not too shabby a place.

Luke made it worth the wait.. \n\nMy wife and I love France and the food, while Luke is a mix of classic French and German flair the French side is definitely the shining star here.. \n\nThe decor is a bit simplistic, but in a good way. Light colored hardwoods and shared bench seating are both warm, comfortable and inviting.\n\nThe menu is is a bit German, a good amount of French and a splash of Creole added. \n\nWe started out with the gumbo which was perfectly balanced and seasoned well. I'm not a seafood lover and I have to say this was the best gumbo I have ever tasted, my wife agreed. \n\nOh before I forget.. The French bread and butter were done so well it would have made Lionel Poilane smile..\n\nFor mains my wife had the crab ravioli and I had the ribeye, both were excellent.\n\nThe pasta looked and tasted handmade and the sauce was creamy yet delicate, while the crab was fresh and large.\n\nThe ribeye I had was great, I want to address the comment below about  the ribeye being mostly fat.. Ribeyes are just that, a well marbled cut of meat which lends itself well to being slow roasted (Prime rib, Standing rib roast) when grilled the fat will be more prominent especially at lower temps.. Maybe he got a bad cut, but knowing your proteins is half the battle.. Back to the steak, I enjoyed my ribeye and the presentation on a wooden cutting board is a nice touch, however I did not care for the b\u00e9arnaise sauce.. The fries were a bit salty for me, but I'm a hypersensitive to course salts so some might like them.. After brushing the salt off the taste was spot on and tasted like they were fried in a good oil not just plain ole veg.\n\nFor dessert we split the bread pudding and were pleasantly surprised at the souffle style presentation.. The taste was good, however the ice cream could use some work and I would try another dessert next time.. Even with the ice cream, it's still a very, very good dessert, I'm just more of a chocolate lover.. \n\nDrinks at Luke are AMAZING! It's not the typical NO drinks, these are high end fine cocktails.. The French 75 is well worth the price of admission and the brandied cherries that are put in random drinks are out of this world good.. Also, any time someone goes to the trouble to put a super high end Italian steam pump espresso machine in his restaurant I'm impressed.. The latte my wife had was better than I can make at home using peaberry Jamaican blue mountain.. \n\nFor the value, concept and variety this is one of my favorite restaurants in New Orleans..\n\nFive Stars", "date": "2010-12-01 19:11:37"}

She then asked whether the other woman was going to get a divorce & if that was her husband's plan as well. Why he hadn't left her & their 3 kids last year & when he had become such a good liar. Smartly, the husband kept his answers polite & vague. He didn't have a plan, he didn't know why he hadn't broken up w/ his wife, he wasn't sure how long it would take them to figure out if they were getting a divorce or not.  \n\nNeedless to say, my husband & I were shocked when we realized what was going on two feet from us. To our further horror, the waiter kept reminding them that there was no rush! I wanted to yell, \"Do you know WTF they are talking about?  Don't you want them to leave?\" I guess all the experts say you should have this kind of conversation in a public place because it encourages some restraint from yelling & getting violent, but don't tell that to my husband & I when we're just trying to have a good meal on vacation. They eventually left & were replaced by a gay couple who ended up asking to switch seats because it was too cold at that table. Cold is right. Cold from the cheating vibes lingering.  \n\nWe managed to order drinks (beer & nice, but small, Chardonnay) & put in for appetizers. I thoroughly enjoyed the Luke Salad despite the odd platting--the whole leaves of Bibb lettuce were lightly dressed w/ the Buttermilk dressing, but the cubes of cucumber tossed in dill w/ carrot slivers & pieces of pickled beets were served underneath the lettuce. I could see the beets peering out, but I almost forgot about the other accoutrements. I know that Bibb lettuce is fragile, but I would have preferred the salad tossed or topped w/ the other bits or if the plate was larger so everything could be visible. In any case, it was a tasty salad. My husband had a cup of the crab bisque, which was too crabby for me. He enjoyed it, though to be a bisque, it should have been a touch thicker or creamier.  \n\nFor entrees, my husband had the crab ravioli which he liked. I had the \"cassoulet\" w/ duck confit & pork sausage. Since it's cassoulet, I imagined the pork would be stewed in w/ the white beans & vegetables & there might be small piece of duck confit. Well, boy was I wrong. It came out in a 9\"cast iron dish mouth-searing hot. The duck was not small, but a WHOLE LEG; the sausage was not stewed in, but a whole German-style long BRAT laying on the side of the dish. To finish it off, there was PORK BELLY about 1\"2 on top. It smelled delicious & I smartly enjoyed the aroma while it cooled down. When I stuck my fork in, I found a scarcity of white beans & mostly breadcrumbs cooked, get this, in small pieces of PORK FAT. To recap:\"cassoulet\"=2 large pieces of fatty meat+1 small piece of fatty meat+bread crumbs+a few white beans+more meat fat. My husband found this kind of amusing since I am an advocate of eating meat fat since it's super tasty (Bourdain=proud of me), but this has got to have been the most decadent, over the top, ridiculous cassoulet ever served (Bourdain would not have approved).  \n\nI tasted a bit of each component before I called it quits. The server, to his credit, asked me twice if it was not to my liking to which I honestly responded, it's just \"so rich.\" I'm just not the type to send things back & make a fuss, but the dish should have been a 1/5 of the size & an appetizer NOT called \"cassoulet.\" It's not that the description on the menu was completely inaccurate, I guess...personally, I think the server should have warned me. It's too bad my husband wasn't feeling well & that we don't love oysters (since they have a raw bar) because I think we would have tried to salvage my meal w/ dessert or seafood or cheese/spread plate.   \n\nThe menu at Luke is not all over the top like this though we heard the server explain that there is an off the menu vegetarian plate because literally there were NO veggie entrees on the menu which is to be expected at a French/German restaurant, but still. Somehow I think a place that bills itself to be pretty nice could do a more authentic cassoulet & have a French/German/NOLA inspired veggie dish.", "date": "2010-12-28 17:15:10"}

We were visiting Nola for the holidays, and got a recommendation for Luke from our concierge. This is the unfortunate story of our dinner there.\n\nFirst, we had reservations, and were seated promptly. Our server took a few minutes to get to us, but ok - they were full. No problem. We ordered drinks, then he ducked away as we were going to ask questions about the menu. Ok, again, it was busy. The drinks arrived promptly, and we got water, and were able to ask a few questions about the menu, which is honestly pretty poorly explained. For example, the menu lists an item called \"shrimp en cocotte\" - we asked what that meant, and he didn't answer - just repeated what the menu said. We ordered said shrimp dish, and I ordered the \"entrecote\" (ribeye), and a bowl of soup. The soup came immediately, Matzo ball chicken, and it was great -  peppery, not too salty, nice texture to the Matzo ball. So far, so good.\n\nAt this point, looking around, I realized that our server had all the tables in the front two thirds of the place. He was running his butt off, admittedly, but virtually no one else was helping him out. There were a couple of  food runners, but they were only coming out of the kitchen to bring food to tables - nothing else.\n\nSo then our entrees arrive. My steak looked delicious, but there were no fries. And clearly, the dish is \"entrecote and frites\" on the menu. The food runner disappeared so fast, though, that he didn't hear me calling after him. I also had only the butter knife, and try though I might, it didn't get through the steak well. My guy started in on his shrimp right away, and it was great. Shrimp were tender, perfectly cooked, and the grits were phenomenal. \n\nIt was literally three or four minutes before ANY server, of any variety, passed anywhere near our table, and I could ask for fries and a steak knife. I did get both, at last, and the fries were tasty, but not freshly cooked. For a $25 entree, you have got to be kidding me. The steak was very flavorful, though, and prepared medium rare as requested.\n\nAnd this is when it got bad. I can forgive errors in the kitchen, or a food runner bringing out the wrong thing. But we sat for over 20 minutes after we had finished our dishes, napkins on the plates, empty water glasses too, without seeing our server. Or actually, we saw him plenty. He was hustling, even took the orders of tables right next to us, and pointedly avoided looking at our table so he wouldn't have to deal with our empty dishes and need for further service. \n\nAll the time waiting, with nothing to eat or drink, gave me the opportunity to look around. At some point, I noticed that the tables in the front third of the restaurant had bread rolls and butter, but NONE of the tables in the second third (where we were seated) did. Odd. Maybe bread rolls are only provided to half of the patrons. I never figured it out, but literally the whole time we were there, all five tables that I could see in our section didn't get bread. But I saw it being taken to the front tables. \n\nFinally, finally, the guy came over and apologized for neglecting us, and actually said he had been stuck with a table. Only, he hadn't, because I had been watching him for the past 15 minutes. \n\nYes, our server was moving, but the place was ridiculously understaffed. Except for the three, yes THREE, hosts who they had on duty. What restaurant needs three hosts? It was so frustrating to see them literally standing around doing nothing while things were not getting done in the restaurant. \n\nAnyway, no matter how good the food is, terrible service ruins a meal. I really had been looking forward to dessert, but there was no way I was giving them more of my money, or spending more time there. \n\nThis place is so horribly mismanaged that no one should waste there money there, even if the chef is a James Beard award winner. He clearly has nothing to do with this place anymore. \n\nAnd yes, we still tipped over 15%. We just can't ever short-change someone in the service industry. But this place does not deserve your money. Don't go.", "date": "2010-12-29 02:18:42"}

The European influence is evident on this menu, and I feel like Chef Besh captured the essence of what a cuisine does as it mutates over the years. He just skipped the 50 years it would take for his menu to evolve by being chef-smart and pulling it together. \n\nOthers have complained about the beer and wine in odd glassware, but it somehow suits the restaurant. I feel like I should bring my grandfather here for lunch. Retired lawyers and doctors and high-powered business people would spend their morning here, reading papers and sipping a beer and chatting. L\u00fcke feels like the Galatoire's for a different class of people. \n\nI've eaten at L\u00fcke a couple ways: straight dinner, just apps, and a mixed meal. The very best decision I made was P&J oysters (a dozen for $13!), the poached yard-egg salad sans bacon (oddly filling), and a slice of Black Forest inspired cake (rich, creamy, heavy with Chantilly cream). The oysters here are always delish, and the price of the local oysters (P&J, for those not in the know) is really competitive for a restaurant in the CBD. \n\nIf L\u00fcke is my magical fantasyland of a restaurant, why only three stars?\nLe sigh. \nSay it with me: the service.  \n\nThe first time my lady and I came, our server looked like she was on speed or something. She was spacy and wired and jumpy without ever making eye contact. Of course we had a chat with the manager. I honestly thought it was a fluke because there were three other servers working the back room (where we sat) that were amazingly attentive and charming. \n\nThen I jump on Yelp and see that everyone else hates the service. But...but...but I love L\u00fcke! I don't want to hate L\u00fcke! This is my little oasis in all of New Orleans! Am I deluded? \n\nSo I visit again. Similar experience. \n\nAnd the third visit is really what sealed my review. \nI came on a Sunday night after work. I sat at the bar with my Kindle. There were two bartenders, hopping around Doing Important Things\u2122. Between making drinks, gossiping with waiters, avoiding the managers, and running back to the kitchen, I sat for 20 minutes before anyone greeted me. Then the really surly bartender threw my menu at me as she walked past. That was surprising. The rest of my meal unfolded in similar, odd fashion with long periods of being ignored followed by rushed service. Having to defend my plate of oysters kept me amused which was good because I probably would have lost it and snapped at someone after the 4th attempt to remove them before I was finished AS I WAS SLURPING. It was like a game, only I would always be the loser. The food runners who brought my salad and my dessert didn't speak to me when they set the food down, but I don't think I can fault them on that. I was obviously reading. It was clear that I was busy so I think they were trying to respect that. \n\nThat dinner took two hours; to say it borders on excessive for one person, seated at the bar, with no cooked food is an understatement. \n\nI think I'll keep coming to L\u00fcke, but my expectations have shifted. (I'm getting so much better at managing my disappointment.) L\u00fcke, if you ever shape up, I'll call you like that proverbial ex-boyfriend who promises to join the Army and get things together. \n\nAccessibility notes: Revolving door at entrance is not automatic.

I stumbled right into happy hour, where the local oysters are 50 cents each and the drink specials are nice.  The oysters were amazing; I had a dozen all by myself.\n\nThat first night, I moved on to the crab bisque and the champagne au peche -- so good.  I'd consulted a really sweet bartender who told me the bisque was a better choice than the seafood gumbo.  I liked him... he seemed honest.  It was velvety smooth and had such a wonderful sweetness from the crab.   O-M-G.  From there, I had the shrimp and grits.  Super big, so flavorful, and just the right portion.  I decided to switch drinks to the St. Germaine.  Not as good as the champagne au peche, but nice and crisp from the pear flavor.  Not like I could take any back to my hotel room.  Since I'm not a dessert person, I just finished with coffee.  \n\nEverything was so good that I had to come back for another round the very next night.  I sat in the very same seat the bar, where the same bartender and oyster shucking specialist greeted me.  I think the guy shucking oysters had a little bit of a crush, but I was more interested in those oysters.  Crazy good.  This time, I had to try the cochon.  A girl next to me had it the night before and it just looked so good.  A pork lover's dream.  Fresh bratwurst, pork shank, pork belly, and fresh sauerkraut.  Rich and salty, savory, the hint of vinegar.  I can't even explain how good it was.  You just have to try it.

In said desolate- corner-table-restaurant-abyss, there was no music, no boisterous laughing, and no clinking of glasses and silverware as one would expect from a popular restaurant. Instead, it was just us three and the awkward table of three men seated next to us. \n\nI realize this is not really grounds for a one star review. So let me tell you about the service and the food. Our waiter (who took at least 10 minutes to get us a glass of water) forgot our beer order three times. He asked us twice what we had ordered, then brought the wrong beer on his third trip to our table. He did have a small green order pad in his hand, that he apparently forgot about as well. Writing down the drink order could have saved us all a lot of time. \n\nI ordered the daily gulf fish special, which was nothing special at all. Just fried fish atop three brussel sprouts and a few small potatoes. One friend ordered the duck confit and white bean cassoulet. I did not try it, but it was basically an entire sausage and duck leg atop very dry and very salty white beans and bread crumbs. She only ate about three bites (which went unnoticed by our waiter). Friend #2 ordered the steak and frites which was the one somewhat redeeming part of the meal.

Hard to pass up on $0.50 oysters and half-off drinks, amirite? Fun new fact, at least for me: P&J oysters (the ones offered for Luke's happy hour) are from a local oyster shucking company in New Orleans. I still have so much to learn about this city.\n\nFOOD: Oyster heaven (at least in quantity).\n\nOver the course of our stay, the two of us ordered six-dozen oysters. The majority of them were on the smaller side, but thats probably more a result of the oil spill ramifications than anything else. However, what Luke can control is the amount of water still left in the shells. To an extent, all oysters will have some water residue as a result of cleaning, but these were literally soaked in water to the point where slurping the oysters down wasn't really an option since you'd get a mouthful of liquid to go with them. On the plus side, they were very clean. I was also hoping for another sauce besides the basic cocktail and horseradish, but it wasn't as big of a deal as the water issue.\n\nLum's mint julep was definitely on the strong side so depending on your drinking preferences this can be a positive or negative. Luke has a couple in-house brews available as well, and the Luke Fru (blonde) I tried was actually pretty decent as far as blondes go: \"wheat-ie\" taste, smooth finish.\n\nSERVICE: Professional but absent-minded and over-extended.\n\nOur server was nice, engaging, quick with jokes, and seemed like he knew what he was doing. The problem was that it looked like he was the only server for the entire front room so it took awhile to get anything from him. Even when he seemed like he had a spare moment it was almost impossible to get his attention. Case in point, I was more than willing to order at least another drink or two and another two dozen oysters from him, but with all the long waits in-between service (drink sitting empty 15 minutes, finished oysters on table 10 minutes) happy hour was unfortunately over and we had other engagements. From my viewpoint, it looks like they need more staff.\n\nWhile the staffing issue is pretty much uncontrollable by the staff on the floor, short-changing customers on oysters is not. Good thing I counted our oyster orders because we were short four on the first order of two dozen. That's pretty unacceptable, but kudos to our server for taking care of it and adding the missing ones to our next order.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Like stepping back in time.\n\nI like it. Newspapers hanging from wood poles at different sections of the restaurant, cherry wood everywhere, hunting trophy head over the bar, sweet bar stools. With the music playing overhead it felt like a scene from Boardwalk Empire. It's one of those restaurants where someone could have a nice relaxing meal but it wouldn't seem out of place to see higher-society types getting a little boisterous. Noise suits Luke.\n\nRELATIVITY: How does it compare to expectations and other restaurants in its class?\n\nSlightly not as good as expected, especially when considering the class of restaurant that Luke is embracing.  One glance at their regular dinner menu and it's clear what type of clientele they are catering to and what style of dining they're wanting to provide. The quality didn't match up with the expectations, I guess.\n\nOVERALL: Three stars overall, no bonus for relativity.\n\nThis is probably one of the best happy hour deals you're going to see in the city value-wise, but if a place wants to convince me to come back for a dinner experience then even the nitty-gritty parts of happy hour should be up to snuff. I guess based on Luke's pedigree, I expected better-prepared oysters and a bit better service than what we received.", "date": "2011-02-11 17:26:45"}

So I start waiting again and don't even get a I'll be right with you or anything.  Maybe I'm exaggerating the length of time, but at that point I was done so I just walked out.\n\nDuring my next rotation in the city, I decided to give them another shot.

Honestly, it was pretty bland and that's coming from someone who cooks without using a lot of salt.  \n\nAs others have mentioned, their service seems inconsistent and understaffed.

The oysters were served with three different sauces - and I enjoyed the horseradish one the best.   \n\nI give Lukes five stars for the burger, the shrimp and the oysters.  My friend had the ravioli which she did not say much about.", "date": "2011-02-18 03:47:56"}

So excited that I, at 5' tall, braved my way on foot through mardi gras parade crowds ON MARDI GRAS and the rain to get there.  I was a little nervous since the hostess was rude and dismissive when I'd called about a reservation but I was willing to put it off to them maybe being swamped because, well, it was mardi gras.  When I arrived I was suprised to find that, although it was about halfway through the blessed Luke happy hour, they weren't that busy and there were about 6 unbussed tables that didn't get cleared the entire 20 minutes I sat at the bar waiting on a table. I really like the table I was seated at though.  Front room, back corner single table.  Perfect. \n\nMy waiter (I'm looking at you, Bobby L.) approached the table with pretty much a Don't-Give-Two-Sh*ts attitude.  I know that this isn't August, and I wasn't expecting fine dining service but, at least be slightly congenial or relatively polite.  Thankfully he seemed to warm up ever so slightly so I at least felt as though I wasn't going to be suddenly abandoned.  Though that could've been because of the two couples that got seated next to me.\n\nThe meal:\n$0.50 oysters from 3-6!  Yes!  Needless to say, I started off with a dozen oysters and a blanche du bruxelles.  Well, I would've started off with a dozen oysters if the duck and rabbit liver pat\u00e9 hadn't come out first.  When I say I'd like to start with the oysters and then have the pate, that's pretty much what I mean.  My table was small so it was very cramped with a tray of oysters and the pat\u00e9 set up.  While I'll admit that having that as a problem should really exhibit how lucky I am in life, I'm going to be a brat anyway.  \n\nBobby delievered my oysters with no smile, no oyster fork and no lemons.  After waiting 5 minutes for him to come back around, I was able to get those things.  Regardless of that, the oysters were great quality and very tasty, but I did have to disconnect the muscle on almost all of them myself.  The pat\u00e9 was just fantastic.  Accompanied by bread and butter pickles, pickled watermelon rind, sweet relish, grainy mustard and toasted ciabatta slices - I devoured it.\n\nFor dessert I had the maple pot de creme.  It was alright.  Not sublime, but not awful.  The texture was perfect but something about all the different flavors - the maple, the vanilla bean, the espresso caramel and candied pistachios - all sounded like they should've worked together but they just don't.  I guess I may have also been a little put off by the fact that it arrived in the same container type as the pat\u00e9 and had a simlar color to it.  I can't fault the dish for my brain's insistence that each bite was supposed to taste like pat\u00e9.  I know they're going for the whole down-home thing, but I think they could've come up with a better dish for the dessert. \n\nOverall, it was a decent experience.  If they could just amp up the service some, it would be a great experience.  That seems to be the common theme in the reviews I'm reading.  I would certainly hope that John Besh would want his customers treated better than the way I saw them being treated.  In the meantime, ask for a different waiter.", "date": "2011-03-11 19:21:06"}

I decided oysters would hit the spot (okay and maybe a drink too).  Luke has three types of oysters, the local P&J oysters (from 3:00 to 6:00, they are only $0.50 a piece), they also have Kumomoto and Blue point.  That day, I chose to get a half dozen of the P&J and a half dozen of the blue point.  I also ordered a sazerac (of which I promptly took a picture and sent to Gregg M so he could see what he had to look forward to when he got there).  The sazerac was good - they use Herbsaint rather than Pernoud like we get up here, but I really liked it.  I thought it was very well balanced with a hint of licorice.  My second drink was the St Charles Side Car - it was extremely peary, so not my favorite.  The oysters though were definitely the highlight.  They shucked them right in front of me, keeping up a good duologue and even let me try one Kumomoto that got shucked \"accidentally\".  I won't say that the P&J are my favorite as they don't necessarily have some of the depth that say the blue point or the Kumomoto's have, but they sure hit the spot.  \n\nSince I enjoyed it so much, when Gregg M got in to town, this is where I took him for an oyster fix.  We got a dozen of the P&J and a half dozen of the blue point and Kumomoto.  I'll let him tell you about his impressions, but on this trip I did get different drinks:  The mint julep was only okay to me (I'm spoiled by the one at the Majestic in Old Town!), my other drink was the French 75.  It was good, but not necessarily my favorite.  I did like Gregg's version of the St. Charles Side Car tho' - different bartender.\n\nI can easily say I would go here again for happy hour.  Honestly their menu didn't look too bad either - but that will be for another time.\n\nOne note - the individual shucking oysters on the second trip was not very good at letting the bartender know when an order was up.  As a result, some people (including us) were waiting a little while for our oysters.  Just goes to show you how important a little communication is - even if all you are saying is \"order up\"", "date": "2011-04-05 18:22:24"}

Good:  made last minute reservations,at 8pm, on a whim and within 15 minutes of a phone call and short walk from our hotel, we sat at our table.  Bad:  It then took about 15 minutes for anyone to come offer drinks and or answer questions about the menu.  Once our waiter came, he was nice enough, but interestingly honest, when we asked him about the menu.  Very informative about the homemade, fresh, local food.  They raise there own pigs and veggies and whatnot. I was looking to do the brisket special, but was told that was a bad choice, as per my waiter that, and a few other items were subpar.  He recommended the burger(made with ground beef and brisket), due to its national acclaim.  So I went with the burger, my wife the crab ravioli, homemade pasta.  Ugly turned Good:  I ordered  a absinthe suisse, (once again the waiter warned against, stating that it was quite bad, but i figured i would give it a go anyway)... should have listened. two words, Nas-Ty.  He asked how I liked it, I was polite, but honest, and he said no worries, we will get you something else, no extra charge.  next drink much better.  Well now comes the finale, I wish it were grand but it was a mixture of G,B & U.  We did not get our food for about an hour and 15 minutes, keep in mind i we ordered pasta and a burger, not quite a time consuming ordeal.  Was it worth the wait, yes!.... and no.  When our waiter checked on our food that was just brought out, he asked if the fries were warm enough, prompting that he knew they were most likely not. (now he didnt straight out say sorry about the wait, food was done for a while and sitting under the heaters, but his comment and the LUKE warm fries and burger, surely did.)\nI ordered my burger medium rare, but got medium, medium well. I would agree that it is one of the best burgers that I have eaten, and I am a burger fancier, but the interesting thing was my favorite part was the bacon, interestingly enough, when i commented on the bacons excellence to my waiter, he straight out told me that it was brought in, and not part of the pork they raise.  once again great honesty, great bacon, good job finding that amazing melt in your mouth flavor, but kinda funny since his main selling point was the interconnectedness with all the ingredients.  Ate a few fries, cold, so-so, let them be.  Now my wife's crab ravioli was pretty darn good, fresh, tasty, and a bit of spice, helping to tame down the sauciness.  perfect blend of yum.  the only thing that could have made this dish better would have been for it not to have mass quantities of crab shell in it.  I understand stuff happens, but would not expect to see it in a quality restaurant. Im not perfect, and i understand things like that happen, like i said I would have preferred it didnt and would have bumped up the star rating a notch had it not. but in one of the bites I had of my wifes plate, I had a shell the size of my fingernail.  Lame.  Had I swallowed that it probably would have hurt quite a bit going down. So there you have it, a mixture of good and bad service, good information and introduction, bad follow through on service and time management.  Good food, so close to Great that it is sad that the few Ugly shells from uncouth preparation destroyed what obvious potential this meal has.", "date": "2011-04-15 10:01:40"}

Wanted a larger quantity I guess.\n\nMy wife ordered the shrimp and grits. A tasty dish, although not a large portion like I have seen at other restaurants. She enjoyed it and we shared our dishes with each other. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the gateau basque cake and a chocolate mousse of which I cannot recall the name. The cake was fantastic. Very dense in the center and a nice crunchy crust on the outside. Strawberries that had been infused with grand marnier were the topping.

Luckily though, we mentioned this to our server and she ended up taking them off our bill. She even mentioned it was a little late in the season, so she wasn't sure why they were still serving them (which would have been good to know before we ordered as we would have gone with the other oysters.  Also, they should have more than 2 types of oysters. Just sayin'). Luckily, we ordered a Bloody Mary to go with the oysters, and it was pretty damn good.  \n\nCochon Pressed Sandwich - Given, I'm not a huge ham fan, but I usually like pulled pork, especially if it's got a kickin' BBQ sauce.  But this was way too sweet, and just not my style.  My girlfriend kind of liked it though, so maybe it's just me.\n\nMussels with Fries- My girlfriend ordered this, and her main complaint with it was that it wasn't served with nearly enough broth, leaving some of the mussels at the top a little dried out.  Other than that, the flavor was decent, and the fries are pretty good.  \n\nI'll be skipping this place next time I'm in town.

I ordered the local Abita amber and watched with pure delight as the ladies who accompanied me tried more adventurous concoctions, such as an egg white and absinthe creation that required the sexy bartendress to get in her daily shake weight routine with a rigorous cocktail shaker emulsification process which seemed to last a minimum of five minutes.  I'm sure she hated me for recommending someone try it.\n\nThe culinary delights abounded from the kitchen to the table sides in waves of trays swept through the dining room by deftly capable servers to the exhilaration of some and the dismay of others who expected that is was their time to dine.  Jumbo seared shrimp over creamy grits, tangy moules et frites, duck and white bean cassoulet, shimmering pork belly and clams in tagliatelle, and a bone in shank or chop of some sort jutting from the plate in a stunning, Flintstonesque presentation. \n\n My jaw dropped at the sight of this meaty delight and I could see from the smirk on my wife's face that she was contemplating the Seinfeld dare of 50 bucks to ask for a taste.  After a few minutes of deliberation she turned to me with the proposition only to find that I was no longer there and to her dismay, as she whirled herself around on her stool, saw that I was already taking a knife and fork to the aforementioned meat shank still resting on the oval tray, much to the horrified stares of the diners and servers alike.

A note for all- two people dining is NOT ENOUGH to really enjoy the goodness this place has to offer. Our first time, my partner and I ordered just a dozen oysters and the rabbit and duck liver pate, thinking it would be a small meal. WRONG. I couldn't believe it when they brought out a mason jar full of pate, with bread and full housemade condiments (relishes, mustard) to boot.

It's light and refreshing on a hot day while still packing a nice punch.  My husband couldn't wait to have the fries again.  However, the best part had to be when I asked the man behind the counter if John Besh himself ever came to the restaurant.  He replied that he did, but not that often.  Not fifteen minutes later, in walked the chef!  Our friend behind the bar was kind enough to wave him over for introductions, hand shakes, and small talk.  Needless to say, we felt compelled to return for Sunday brunch the following day.  Oh. my. goodness.  The special - fried pork chops and waffles with honey pecan butter - was hands down the most delicious thing ever.  I adore fried pork chops, and these were the best I'd ever eaten.  The waffles had drastically improved since our last visit.  Luke is officially a \"must go\" on our New Orleans list.", "date": "2011-05-31 19:17:29"}

Even better is marrying a chef who has chef friends, which I managed to do in March. Lucky us, one thoughtful chef friend gave us a gift card as a wedding gift to any of John Besh's restaurants, 3 of which are in New Orleans, where we honeymooned.\n\nWe chose to go to L\u00fcke, because it seemed the most \"us\". The restaurant is lovely inside, and feels intimate because there are several rooms, even though the space is quite large when you combine all the spaces. We were led back to the room near the kitchen, which might annoy some people, but for us, being able to look through a large plate glass window at the goings-on was added entertainment.\n\nI'll give you the rundown of what we ordered.\n\nCharcuterie plate\nA symphony of pork, rabbit and other delicious things. Pat\u00e9, head cheese, fois gras terrine, house-pickled watermelon rind and other pickles, stone ground mustard and plenty of toasts.\n\nCrabmeat salad\nMostly crab, served on greens, very lightly dressed. Sweetest crab I've ever eaten. Seriously.\n\nFried Oyster and bacon salad with buttermilk dressing\nYes, there's lettuce, but the giant chunks of bacon and the most succulent fried oysters I've ever eaten sit atop this lettuce, and they don't skimp.\n\nMussels and frietes \nI think this was like, 2 pounds of mussels in the best broth I've ever had. The fries were good but I enjoyed dunking the crusty bread that came with the salad and the waitress happily brought more. I think the kitchen staff was sort of amazed watching me eat ALL of this, and I am still not quite sure how I did it either. But I really like mussels.\n\nThe L\u00fcke Burger\nThis thing was huge, the bacon on it was amazing, and husband enjoyed finishing it back at the townhouse as a latenight snack.\n\nThe service here was amazing. Our waitress was so friendly, patient and answered all our questions thoroughly. We could see the amazing efficiency and care in the kitchen, and the sommelier visited with tables and made suggestions clearly loves his job. It was a very lovely meal, and even without the gift card, would have been worth every penny -- though honestly I think this is a very affordable and accessible dining experience even for those who don't think they like fine dining. I think it's no accident L\u00fcke is located in the financial district. I am sure they get lots of business people in there for lunch and dinner.\n\nThis will definitely remain one of the most memorable meals of our honeymoon in New Orleans, and I hope to go back someday!", "date": "2011-06-01 14:45:14"}

We showed up an hour late from what we booked online. The host wasn't fazed at all... he said that we'd be punished later and led us to a table in the back. This restaurant was PACKED so I was appreciative of him finding us a spot and a little humor goes a long way with me.\n\nLet's talk about the food... If you like oysters, MAKE SURE you order the Fried Oyster Salad. You get several huge fried oysters on a bed of romaine, bacon & avocado. Fried...bacon...how could you not want this? It was delicious and a lot of food for a salad.\n\nWe shared a crab meat bisque and it was good but spicy! We got a bowl brought to us with a crawfish head floating in it... I immediately grabbed it (yes with my fingers) and sucked all the crawfish goodness out of it. I was met with a mouth and throat on fire from the heat! After downing the glass of water, wiping away the tears and waiting for my wife to stop laughing...I got the strength to whisper \"hey that's got a little kick\"\n\nYeah...

That's the best way to describe this experience.  I didn't know food could taste this could or make me so giddy.  My friends and I would like to give a special shout-out to Cochon Restaurant for being closed on Sundays-- we never would have discovered Luke otherwise.  \n\nThe 5 of us ordered up a total feast.  And everything was not only delicious, but otherworldly.  The meal hands down blew anything I've ever eaten out of the water, and I've been to some 3 star michelin restaurants.  \n\nAPPETIZERS: We started out with a dozen gulf shrimp and a dozen clams on the half shell.  I was a bit confused why the restaurant refused to serve the clams raw, but cooking, then chilling certainly worked (though personally, I still prefer raw).  The shrimp were AMAZING.  Huge prawns, seasoned like crawfish, firm meat (very fresh).  The platter came with cocktail sauce and remoulade.  The remoulade was superb.  Never had better.  Next, we had Louisiana rabbit and duck liver pate with a variety of sauces (honey mustard, fennel relish, pickled watermelon rinds, sweet peppers).  Creamy, rich, and yet still light.  The portion was a lot larger than I expected.  They could definitely have served half as much at 3/4 the price, and I would actually have been happier.  We also got seafood gumbo and shrimp bisque.  The shrimp bisque was perfect, but for me the seafood gumbo was the only miss of the meal.  There was nothing bad about it, but it was very forgettable in an otherwise unforgettable meal.  Finally, we had flamenkuche (basically, caramelized onions, bacon, and cheese on a flatbread).  Together, the ingredients don't sound all that extraordinary, but the way Chef Besh marries the flavor... total delight.  We were ooing and ahhing through that whole dish.  Either Besh sources grrrrreat bacon, or he has the world's best smoker.  We were literally sucking on the bacon.  \n\nENTREES: We had fried mangalitsa pork, cochon de lait sandwich, crab omelet, and the Luke burger.  Outside of the mangalitsa pork fried crispier than I thought possible; inside, the pork was juicy and tender.  The cochon de lait was the best I've ever had (and it was paired magnificently with a cured ham).  Initially, I was worried about the ham overpowering the cochon, but Besh calmed all fears.  This sauce came with the sandwich and it was also mouthwatering.  The crab omelet was perhaps the most delicate item we ordered.  You could taste the technique in the preparation.  The Luke burger was about as good a burger as you can get.  The bun just CRACKLED every time you bit into it... yet maintained a nice clean texture... not an abrasive one that super-toasted bread can have.  \n\nI am in utter shock at how good this restaurant is.  AMAZED.  Chef Besh, please open a restaurant in the Northeast.  PLEASE.", "date": "2011-06-20 06:24:07"}

We got the lardon and poached egg salad, but the name escapes me right now. The flavor of the lardons and poached egg are great - the greens are an interesting texture.  I think this salad might be better with spring mix of some kind - these greens are kind of chewy and dense - so if you don't like that, you might try something else.\n\nDesert: We opted for the creme brulee - which was fantastic.  The custard was very nicely flavored (I find at a lot of places its often bland).  I think the vanilla bean custard gave it a little more flavor than just a generic vanilla blend.  The top was crusted perfectly.  It comes with fruit on top - which is not just a garnish, but really brings out the flavor of the dish.\n\nFinally, we tried the coffee.  Not that it was anything special - but it is french press and had good flavor, so its a nice way to end the meal.\n\nI've eaten here numerous times and tried many dishes and loved them all.  The burger and other sandwiches are always great - as is the Gumbo.  I can't recommend this place enough.  It is pretty affordable and you really get your monies worth.", "date": "2011-06-21 21:23:09"}

We sat in the back, and first ordered our drinks and some oysters.  Not a very impressive beer selection...and pretty hefty on the pricing.  The oysters came out and were excellent.  This was my first time doing raw oysters and I was impressed...but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up raw oysters....guess I'll give more credit to the Gulf of Mexico on that one.  Next, for my meal, I ordered the duck confit and white bean cassoulet with bacon and sausage.  The meal came out and I first went for the duck wing.  It was simply roasted with some seasonings.  Very tender and very good tasting.  Of course, it seems pretty hard to screw this up too.  I'll give more credit to the duck.  Next came the garlic sausage.  This was not good.  It was a giant six inch long sausage, about 1.5 inches in diameter....just a giant chunk of meat that didn't have much taste.  It was overall pretty bland.  I don't know where the garlic they were talking about is in it.  Next was the smoked bacon.  It was more of a bacon cube.  Just a fatty piece of pork belly....which was almost all fat.  Not impressive.  Last came the white bean cassoulet.  This was also very unimpressive.  I'm not sure what seasonings they added to this or if they added any at all.  It was just white beans with cheesy/mooshy tasteless stuff in between topped with breadcrumbs.  Very, very unimpressive.  Overall, I was very unimpressed with this place, especially considering the reviews and prices.

The pate & charcuterie plate was absolutely amazing with the fennel jam and the pickled watermelon rinds as perfect accompaniments to the pates (the rabbit & duck liver was especially delighful), the pancetta and the delicious head cheese. The boudin noir was just as good as the boudin noir at DBGB in NYC but was made even better by the potato, apple and onion hash it was served with. The flamenkuche (a flatbread with bacon, onions and cheese) was also delicious. We meant to have entrees the first time but ended up full after all that so we had dessert which was bread pudding ala mode with pecans and bourbon sauce and gateau basque which was a vanilla cake that was a cross between a pound cake and angel food cake that had creme fraiche and blueberry sauce on top. It was like a dream it was so good.\nOn the 2nd visit...more oysters and the heirloom tomato salad with fresh mozzarella. The basil and balsamic reductions made for very intense flavors with the tomatoes and mozzarella and the mozzarella practically melted in your mouth. Eric and I shared the shrimp and grits which were also wonderful...just spicy enough and  the grits were perfectly creamy but heavy enough to really complement the andouille and shrimp.\nAnd our third visit was just for dessert and drinks...I got the gateau basque again and it was just as amazing the 2nd time :)\nAnd I would totally come back again a few times when we are back in New Orleans.", "date": "2011-07-04 01:09:21"}

A Southern boy, Besh is a well-known chef throughout the city, owning several restaurants. We decided on L\u00fcke for our first dinner. According to the website, it is Besh' \"homage to the grand old Franco-German brasseries that once reigned in New Orleans.\"\n\nWe made reservations for 5:30 and we're greeted and seated promptly upon arrival. Our waiter was Lee, who had been on vacation for a little while. It showed. More on that later. I decided to order the nightly 3-course pri-fixe special. My wife decided to choose her own. First off for me was seafood gumbo \u00e1 la Creole. The gumbo itself had good flavor, but some of the rice was burnt and one of the oysters had a lot of grit.\n\nMy wife ordered the Shrimp Bisque. It was very flavorful and enjoyable. With a velvety consistency.\n\nFor my entree I had the navarin d'agneau braised lamb with gnocchi and Covey Rise vegetables. I had never had braised lamb before. It was okay, but needed more seasonings. Unfortunately, the stars of the dish were the supporting cast: the gnocchi and vegetables.\n\nMy wife had the shrimp farci (with blood orange hollandaise, crabmeat and shrimp). It was very enjoyable with the hollandaise really elevating the dish.\n\nAgain, my meal came with 3 courses. We were both quite satiated at this point, but dessert came with the meal. The original bread pudding that came out had a hair on it. Immediately it was sent back to the kitchen. The manager apologized, and brought out two new desserts! TWO! We could only pick at each of them. The first was a \"gateau basque\" vanilla cake with blackberries and cr\u00e8me fraiche. We were split on this one; I enjoyed it, while my wife thought it was kind of boring for a dessert. The second dessert we were brought was a chocolate pot de creme. It was very enjoyable with some chocolate pieces on top adding to the texture play.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we would come back to our waiter. Lee, though nice, would come by every 2 minutes to make sure everything was okay. The service was thus suffocating at best. We kept getting interrupted in the middle of our conversations due to him \"checking up\" on us. \n\nThe food at L\u00fcke was decent, nothing that made me say WOW! But it seems like a good restaurant. Perhaps the service problems we had was related to Lee only, but it put a bad taste in our mouth for the restaurant. Maybe next time we're in NOLA, we'll give John Besh another chance. (We hear that Restaurant August is AMAZING!)", "date": "2011-07-06 21:36:06"}

I tend to judge an establishment more on whether or not I could see myself coming back again in the future.  To me, that's really the deciding factor.  That being said, yes, I would come back here again!  While Luke Restaurant may not be a pioneer in the culinary world, the kitchen does deliver sound dishes that cannot be ignored.\n\nLuke Restaurant is located on St. Charles Ave. in the CBD, directly across the street from One Shell Square.  It shares the adjacent space with the Hilton Hotel, which, if anyone remembers pre-Katrina, used to be the boutique Hotel Monaco.  Luke Restaurant used to be The Cobalt, a hip and modern lounge/restaurant owned by Susan Spicer, where great cocktails, as well as amazing eats could be found.  While the restaurant has changed owner, chef and style, the quality of the dishes has not diminished in the slightest.  Luke Restaurant advertises itself as a fine dining Bistro and I would say this description is accurate.  I've been frequenting this restaurant off and on since it's opening in 2007 and I've never been given a subpar product.\n\nI would like to draw special attention to the detail of the interior design inside Luke Restaurant.  It reminds me of a social steakhouse ripped straight out of New York City in the 1920s.  Heavy and very ornately carved wood cabinets, doors and bar surround the dining area.  The floor near the bar is completely tiled in black & white while the dining area is situated upon what resembles vintage wood flooring.  To the front and left side of the restaurant, there is a large wooden board containing various newspapers for businessmen to peruse.  Above dining guests are slow-moving ceiling fans which are operated via a pulley; a system no longer common these days.  The restaurant sports a very vintage feel and I believe this works in Luke's favor.  The only other steakhouse resembling Luke Restaurant in terms of interior design and dish offering that comes to mind would be Anthony Bourdain's home base, Brasserie Les Halles, located on Park Ave. in New York.\n\nThe last two occasions that I dined in Luke Restaurant were over lunch with colleagues.  I am somewhat a slave to routine so I placed my order for the Luke Burger, a monster of a burger that attempts to contain tomatoes, Allen Benton's bacon, caramelized onions and Emmenthaler cheese within the confines of the bun.  It also comes with housemade fries.  Now, believe me when I say that while this burger is steeply priced at $17, I dare you to eat it all in one sitting.  I typically cut the burger in half and take the rest home, as it easily can feed a single person twice!  It is delivered to the customer on a cutting board and you are given pocket sized bottles of Ketchup, Mustard and Mayonnaise.  This is one heck of a huge burger but it's worth every penny!\n\nBefore diving into the burger, I also placed a starter of the gumbo that, when paired with the fresh rolls, is out-of-this-world!  The rest of my table ordered various dishes and starters but all who had selected the gumbo also stated it was terrific!\n\nMy burger later arrived and it looked amazing.  The flavor was breathtaking.  The large cuts of bacon, the delishus swirl of caramelized onions and cheese created a sweet aroma so thick, one might say you could swim in it!  The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the flavors came together in a manner that literally created an orgiastic feast of the senses.  In the nature of a true wine connoisseur who takes most pleasure from a vintage's distinct scent, I thoroughly enjoy breathing in the fresh smells from a dish produced by a kitchen.  At such times, one could wish for the olfactory powers of the canine.  It's often occurred to me that pulling a dog away from a scent is akin to seizing a scholar at the museum by the scruff of his neck and dragging him away from his studies.\n\nAs I've said before, Luke Restaurant may not be groundbreaking but what it does deliver is exceptional quality and great service.  This is a wonderful place to pop in by yourself or with a small group for lunch or dinner.  If you find yourself hungry and within proximity, do yourself a favor and visit Luke.  Your tummy will thank you!", "date": "2011-07-20 13:01:00"}

Immediately, we were treated with some amazingness in the form of meat:\n\nOnion Tart appetizer: Amazingly tasty smoked bacon, emmenthaler swiss, and carmelized onions, baked on top of a thin crispy bread. It was a flavorful combination of cooked items, cheesy and smoky at the same time. Only bad thing was it was overly herbed, as there were lingering flavors of herbness that drowned out the rest. 7 out of 10.\n\nRibeye Steak: 10 ounces of prime beef, perfectly grilled, topped with an herb butter, sided with bernaise and frites. It gets an 8 out of 10, simply because a ribeye should be no smaller that 16 ounces.\n\nPork Shank: RIDICULOUSSAUCE. Must've been cooked for a day before. There is no way the chef gets an order for this fall-off-the-bone amazingness and is able to take it from raw to amazing in 15 minutes. Slow roasted, TENDER, with an amazing sauerkraut underlining and a hidden sausage just under the shank. 10 out of 10.\n\nWe left in the worst food coma that I may have ever experienced.

Restaurant August is a religious experience for many, and while that's all well and good, I wanted to see if chef Besh's skill was matched by his range. Luke (no I'm not typing the superfluous umlaut) is often spoken of as the low brow foil to August, and a glance at the menu would seem to confirm that, provided you know your French well enough that \"en cocotte\" comes off as a fancy way of saying baked in a ramekin. The luxury inherently associated with anything French is then more of a charade than anything else.  Would the atmosphere therefore be as proletariat as the menu positioned itself to be?\n\nUnsurprisingly, yes and no. Walking in, I was stunned at just how brotastic it felt. Though not sportsbar loud, it was quite lively. Corporate types in the midst of their midlife crises slurped down freshly shucked oysters with abandon. Amicable chatter flowed down the length of the bar, while families with children either cowered in corners or screamed at their precious little houligans. Before I'm written off as either a stuffy old man or some sort of codger, I should point out that I'm twenty-two years old, and I'm not counting this sort of atmosphere as a detraction from the restaurant. It wasn't what I expected, but it wasn't entirely unpleasant for that. That's not to say this matched the ambiance of a typical New Orleans local hangout, and I don't believe that is how one would describe Luke. The gift and curse of being located in a hotel means an ever changing clientele. This largely explains the eclectic assortment of diners, and the clashing within those segments. Normally a loud atmosphere is associated with joviality, but at Luke, it was simply a function of various groups talking over each other.\n\nHaving on good authority that the food was going to be excellent, I was ready to call this review Luke, the tragic hero of the philistines, that is, until we were finally seated. As our hostess whisked us past the bar, we came in sight of the true heart of Luke; its second dining room. With warm lighting, appropriately spaced tables, and an open view into the kitchen, it oozed elegant and self assured sensibility. But really, should you have expected anything different? After all, how cozy and unpretentious can a location on the 300 block of St. Charles really be? This ultimately confirmed my suspicions that Luke must have retained some trappings of its plush surroundings and the regal nature of its preceding restaurant. Having yet again experienced the dichotomy of the restaurant, on the one hand avowing accessibility while on the other maintaining illusions of French grandeur, I became even more curious about the food.\n\nLuckily, the food, in most ways, never disappointed. Besh truly is at his best infusing Creole classics with his Western European training. The food was comforting enough to feel familiar, but refined enough for one to discover unique touches and ingredients throughout the meal. My only complaint is a bit nitpicky. In a menu touting all of the house-made and house-cured meats available, I find it odd that the bacon is not given the same treatment, and is instead sourced from elsewhere. This is not to say that Allen Benton's bacon is bad; indeed, far from it. It just seems to be somewhat an admission of laziness on the part of the restaurant not to make their own.\n\nAll in all, Luke makes a worthy attempt at championing itself as a place where anyone can go for unpretentious food and professional service. Closet foodies will appreciate the secretly (sometimes not so secretly) pretentious food, while everyone else will like the lack of affectation.The prix fixe is positively affordable, and the pricey cocktails are matched by a robust and inexpensive tap selection. For this, it deserves our praise, not anti Besh backlash. \n\nWhy only four stars then? Because you screwed up my Sazerac, Johnny.", "date": "2011-09-06 12:02:28"}

I like that the menu still tries to incorporate some southern dishes (ie:Gumbo) but if you've been in NOLA for a few days I'm sure you're looking for a little change of pace.  \n\nFor starters they serve fresh baked french bread.  I have to admit this bread was better than anything I've had all weekend.  If only all Po Boy's could be made with fresh baked bread....  I recommend adding one of the soups as well.  I made an effort to try as many Gumbos in NOLA and Luke's did not disappoint.  \n\nIf you are a meat lover, you will love the Choucroute Garnie Maison (smoked pork shank, Mangalitsa belly & bratwurst, house-made sauerkraut).  This dish can easily serve 3.  I'm just a big fan of Mangalitsa anything so this was a no brainer for me.  The smoked pork shank was tender and the meat was falling off the bone.  Very rarely will I ever leave any food on the plate but it was too much...I could not finish this dish.\n\nMy gf ordered the Etoufee of Blue Crab & Brown Shrimp (fennel, garlic, saffron fumet, handmade garganelli).  It's not your typical Saucy Etoufee with rice, intstead it's a light pasta dish but you have to love the fresh garganelli.      \n\nWhatever you do, make sure to leave room for Brendan's Bread Pudding.  It's pretty good.\n\nI would have given Luke a 5 star review had it not been a rowdy table that ruined the 1st half of our meal.  Instead of throwing the drunk diners out, they just moved everyone from the back dining room to the front.  A small apology was given but nothing material to make up for the unpleasant experience.  I just expected more from a John Besh restaurant.", "date": "2011-09-09 15:31:23"}

Bourbon, mint, sugar (simple syrup), ice...sounds easy enough but they are often made incorrectly and, in my opinion, if the ice isn't crushed, it's not suitable for sipping on even the least sophisticated of verandas. \n\nLuke's serves theirs in a cylindrical glass with a nice sized snow cone of crushed ice protruding from the top. Sweet enough to take the edge off the bourbon and muddled to release the flavor of the mint without shredding the leaves beyond all recognition, the result is a refreshing cocktail so cold a thick layer of frozen water vapor encrusts the glass once stirred.

They have a few beers that they have specially made for them and they offer some specialty cocktails. \n\nMy favorite thing to do here is go for the Happy Hour raw oyster special.  The oysters used to be 25 cents each but the BP troubles (that caused us to release lots of fresh water into our wetlands and the fresh water, and not oil, killed off a lot of our oyster beds) caused an oyster shortage resulting in the price doubling to 50 cents an oyster but $6 for a dozen is still a great deal.  The happy hour goes from 3-6pm and it gets pretty crowded by around 4 so it can be a bit challenging to find a bar stool sometimes.

I'm from Ohio -- so, needless to say, I was on the search for some great creole and cajun food.\n\nIt was fantastic!!! We had a small group, so we started with the cold seafood platter with oysters, clams, crab, shrimp, and mussels; and an assortment of pate, cheese and bread. WOW. Obviously the fresh oysters were fresh from the gulf -- you could taste it! The texture was light and ever-so-slightly salty. The other seafood was okay, so if I had to choose again, I'd just get more oysters. Great cold seafood bar! The rabbit pate was pretty good too, so be adventurous and try a few different items!\n\nI had recently made Shrimp and Grits at home, therefore decided to see what they actually tasted like in New Orleans. Not bad - mine were better. I think it's mostly because I liked my grits a little creamier. Theirs were lumpy and slightly dry. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned with what tasted like a little blackened seasoning. I prefer a more tomato and garlic approach. Nonetheless, they were still tasty and delicious.\n\nAgain, since I was jonesin' for some cajun food, I had a cup of seafood gumbo as a side. Whoooowheeee, awesome!  It was very flavorful and had a decent amount of seafood. The bowl was completely empty... \n\nThe service was impeccable on the Monday night I visited.

Decent food, but nothing to go out of your way for. The dessert was better than the entrees. OMG, try the pot de creme (a chocolate mousse dessert) or the L'opera (huge ass layer cake with chocolate sauce on top).\n3. Amazing coffee. Best coffee I drank in NOLA.\n\nCONS:\n1. Questionable service. I called to make a reservation for 5 around 8:30. The hostess said they were busy and it would be about 20 minutes. We walked in at 8:45, so a few minutes early. She said, \"Your reservation is not till 9. Your table won't be ready until then or maybe even later. That's your table over there. They just need to clear it.\" \n\nWTF. First off, she didn't give me the time when I called. Second off, our table was empty. Just not bussed/cleaned yet. She sent us to the bar while our table sat unattended and unbused for 40 minutes! They weren't even terribly busy and I have no idea how this system makes sense. How long does it take to clear a table? Apparently a long time.\n\nWhen we finally sat down, we were ready to order given the fact that we had 40 minutes to look at the menu. The waitress asked us, \"Anything to drink?\" I said, \"Sure, but we're also ready to order our food.\" She said, \"Oh, I can't take your order yet. Just drinks.\" I asked, \"Why not?\" She said, \"I need to place this order I just took first. Then I'll be back.\" \n\nAgain, random and weird excuses.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE unless you want to experience potentially strange service protocols. DO GO HERE if you are okay with this fact and want some good coffee and dessert.\n\nAs for me, I won't be coming back.", "date": "2011-10-11 00:41:02"}

Also, check out the beautiful tin pressed ceiling. Overall the atmosphere is that of a refined, yet casual (if a bit detached), brasserie. Mid-afternoon there seemed to be mainly business people here, but I wonder what the ambiance is like in the evening.\n\nFor drinks, I asked the bartender to pick one of the local beers on tap, and I was given a glass of Luke Fru blond lager ($6.5). I don't do lager[2], and I wish I was given Luke Amber Alt instead. The draft menu, albeit limited, includes two of my favorite beers: Maredsous tripel ale ($9.50) and Aventinus dopplebock ale ($8).\n\nHaving come here specifically for oyster happy hour (P&J oysters $0.50/ea 3-6pm), we started with a plate of 24 P&J's.  Getting two dozens for two people was, in hindsight, a bit overoptimistic: these oysters are about double the size of your average oyster! However, as it often happens with these mollusks, flavor is inversely proportional to size. Apart from a nice, mineral aftertaste, I found the oysters to be bland, and the meat too soft. This oyster probably gives its best when fried.\n\nThe entree of the day was fried Mangalitsa pork loin with Belgian waffle, pecan butter, and bacon-apple hash ($15). The dish was impeccably executed: the meat was perfectly fried on the outside, and nice and tender on the inside; the presentation in a skillet was quite pleasing. Overall, however, the dish was rather heavy[3], and skewed towards a dominance of sweet notes that I found, at times, overpowering.\n\nNice, solid place. The food is a bit heavy, but portions are generous and prices decidedly reasonable.\n-----------------------------------\n[1] And being a cheap ass, you may add.\n\n[2] My bad for not telling the bartender.\n\n[3] This meat already has about double the marbling of average pork.", "date": "2011-10-11 19:28:02"}

One dish was good enough to warrant our return.  One of them was good and the other tasty but missed the mark. There are two areas - the bar and a separate, quieter dining area.  The bar was crazy busy and deafening.  Luckily we'd made OpenTable reservations so we were able to get seated.  Unfortunately, it was in the bar area.  When I asked the hostess about eating in the quieter area, she said there was a wait (didn't say how long) and pretty much indicated that our table would be in the bar.  At first she sat us at a dirty table.  We were immediately moved to a ready table after I complained.  Minutes later we saw the couple that came in after us seated in the dining area.  WTF?!\nThe Food: we ordered the Flamenkuche - an Alsatian onion tart, for a starter.  This is one of the best things we've had anywhere.  Piled high with caramelized onions, rich cheese, crispy pork, and a beautiful crunchy crust.  It was too rich to finish - definitely too much for two people.  We ordered the shrimp and grits (jumbo shrimp \"en cocotte\") and a shrimp/blue crab ettoufee .    The shrimp/grits had a great flavor, but the kitchen was heavy-handed with the salt.  I like salty, but this was almost excessive.  The dish could've used 30% more grits and 30% less salt and it would've been great.\nThe shrimp/blue crab ettoufee was served over pasta, along with what seemed like melted butter, not much of a real sauce - we didn't taste the fennel.  The seafood in it was excellent, but there wasn't any balance to the dish - nothing to offset the richness.\nWe ordered a fig tart and got a cold apple one instead (almost seemed stale).  Not a good tart at all.  When we asked the waiter about it - he said they didn't have the fig tart.  He comped  a couple of our drinks to make up for the dessert - worked out well, but why don't they take the fig tart off of the menu?\nThis should be a four-star review, except for the screw up with the dessert, the lackluster hostess skills, and the mediocre ettoufee.", "date": "2011-11-11 04:47:54"}

It was a short walk from our hotel which was nice and once we arrived at the Hilton we noticed that the restaurant had its own separate entrance and over the door the sign welcomes you to LUKE. \n\nLUKE is a very nice restaurant, everyone in this place was dressed up and enjoying themselves which just added to the experience. Once seated we were promptly offered fresh baked bread and our drink order taken. Now the bread was fantastic but is it me or when dinning in a restaurant with a french chef, does the butter always taste better??? After spending some time reviewing the menu Niki chose the Rib Eye (what a surprise, lol) and I chose a cup of seafood gumbo to start and Rabbit Fricassee over pasta.\n\nAfter a short wait my seafood gumbo arrived, it was great, no excellent, It was the best gumbo I had in a long while, French Chef, no surprise there. It was just how I like it hot, full of seafood, and just a spoonful of rice. Bravo! Our entrees showed up and Niki's steak looked sooo good and served on a wood cutting bored, how cool is that? The rabbit fricassee and pasta was to die for and a rare treat that I will have to enjoy again. I know alot of people cringe at the thought of eating rabbit but boy was this so so tasty.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the bread pudding. It was delicious and perfectly made. Alot of places just go way overboard with bread pudding and stuff it full of stuff.

Once the burger arrived (very quickly), I did not realize what I was about to eat. This might have been the best burger I ever had. An over reaction? Maybe. But really, It was so damn good.

I keep coming back, as I'll have a great experience, as I did last Monday night watching the Saints at the bar and noshing on the exquisite pates and sausages. Doug had the duck and thought it was brilliant. The one low point that night were the raw oysters, which were small and not as juicy and plump as oysters we've had in the last few days at other restaurants. Last night we returned and tried the oysters again, which were so petite that we complained to the waitress; she brought us a few extras. Honestly, I've watched guys shucking oysters at Casamento's and Acme who toss aside the really little ones. They should do that here, put them in a stew or something. Doug had the chicken (poulet gran mere) and said it was the driest chicken he's ever eaten. I had the skate wing and it was delicious. So it's a mixed bag. If you order anything with bacon in it, the bacon is all you'll taste. It's a brilliant product, but overwhelms the other flavors in any dish it's in, as it's so heavily smoked. This is not my go to place for light food, as things lean toward the heavy side, but if you like Alsatian style charcuterie, it's quite good. Try to go and sit at the bar on a night when Tomas is working...he's a terrific bartender, and the Sazerac here is one of the best on the city.", "date": "2011-12-31 18:53:09"}

We were immediately seated in the back room and I was ecstatic to be able to see the kitchen in action. The decor at Luke brought me back to another time-very old school indeed. \n\nOur server was great, though I can't recall his name. We followed his lead and started our meal off with a 1/2 dozen oysters and the cochon balls which were fried. Literally these are pigs feet that are simmered for hours upon hours and finally balled up and pan fried. I can say without a doubt that I would recommend these to anyone who went to Luke. They melted in my mouth and were accompanied by a rich sauce. The oysters were fresh and in peak season. We were in agreement that these were the best oysters we had ever eaten. \n\nTo continue our meal I had the shrimp and grits. These were the best shrimp and grits I had on my food tour of NOLA. The shrimp were succulent and the grits were creamy and smooth. My boyfriend ordered the pork shank. When it arrived we were shocked to see how large this entree was. The pork shank was the size of an infant and was accompanied by a house-made bratwurst, potatoes and huge chunks of pork belly. It was incredibly rich, but he demolished his dish. \n\nSince I was feeling good that the bf's meal was a great deal bigger than mine, I opted for dessert. At our server's recommendation, we ordered the Gateau Basque. Our server told us it was prepared by pouring the batter into a pan that was already heated up-clever. This makes for a crunchy, almost burnt crust and a soft, gooey interior. The manager also let us know that while the cake is baking it is injected with a syrup to keep it moist. Topped with candied citrus and creme fraiche, this was one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. It was the perfect balance of textures and flavors. \n\nOverall, the bf and I enjoyed Luke so much that we came back 2 more times on our NOLA vacation to take advantage of the 1/2 price oysters and drinks for happy hour. The 3rd time we came service was pretty slow and inattentive, but our previous experiences outweighed this minor problem. I will support anything that John Besh puts his name on after my experience at Luke.", "date": "2012-01-04 02:45:30"}

The first time I went, I had the traditional Southern Breakfast...bacon, eggs, blah, blah.  It was good, but not something you couldn't get at your local Denny's.  This time, I opted for the local favorite, Grillades and Grits.  For those that don't know, Grillades are slow cooked pieces of meat with vegetables served over grits.  The meat can be beef, veal, or port--at Luke they use pork shoulder.  I accepted the upsell of two poached eggs for $5 added to the already hefty portion of grillades and grits I knew was coming.  The grillades were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside and perfectly seasoned.  The vegetables and sauce they were bathed in were reach and creamy, and balanced well with the thick grits they were piled on top of.  The eggs didn't do anything for the dish in my opinion, except for that they looked nice on either side of the cast iron dish they were served on.\n\nAll in all, the dish was great.  I have had better grillades (try Coulis on Prytania) and for less money ($18 at Luke), but these definitely made my top 3 in taste.  The price is what I have the biggest problem with--traditionally in Louisiana, this is a hearty breakfast dish made with inexpensive, leftover cuts of tough meat, served over grits, which are also traditionally inexpensive.  By adding two poached eggs (which were quite overcooked), the dish before tax, tip, and beverage comes to $23.  I doubt any Cajuns had this price point in mind when they came up with this dish back in the day!\n\nLuke's service has been consistently good over my last two visits.  The Franco-German look and feel to the restaurant was quite well done.  I will return to Luke in the near future to try their lunch and dinner dishes.  They were stocking the seafood bar as we left this morning, so I may have to check out their oysters and mussels on a future visit as well.", "date": "2012-01-05 16:16:40"}

We began with sparkling wine and 2 dozen oysters. Both were amazing. Oysters were full and so fresh. They were served with cocktail sauce, vinegar and enough horseradish to make our eyes water in delight. Our next course we switched to a really awesome white wine (sorry I don't recall the name) but it was suggested by our awesome server. His name is Christopher Doppenschmidt in case you would like to ask for him. I then asked if it would be possible to get the shrimp from the raw bar hot. His response: we can do that!

I told our bartender that my goal was to have every drink invented in New Orleans, and he joked around with me, like, how could this tiny woman handle all that bourbon and gin?  Size matters not...judge me by my size, do you? ;)\n \nI already knew what I was going to have for breakfast after I saw Luke's menu three months ago...Eggs in a Jar.

Lightly fried softshell crab, creamy, buttery grits, perfectly poached eggs, and this heavenly hollandaise sauce is what I'm talking about!!!

Luke's version included a buster crab, along with a thick cut of bacon between two behemoth pieces of brioche - how Julius was able to get it all in his piehole is beyond me!\n \nWhen we finished our amazing meals, we were ready to blow this thing and go home!  BUT, our bartender topped it all off by giving me a complimentary drink (I totally forgot what he called it, I was already tipsy from the mint julep :P) Awesome service AND out-of-this-world food?  May the force be with you, Luke!", "date": "2012-01-18 15:52:21"}

Food was great, but I wasn't too crazy about the space and they were way understaffed when we went.\n\nWent here my 2nd night in New Orleans when in town for business.  Our party of two was seated right at our reservation time, but then we had to wait quite a while for our waiter.  She finally came, and was super nice and sweet (and new we found out).  She took our drink order, and then left us to look over the menu.  We had plenty of time to decide, because the drinks took like what felt like forever.  I think it was at least 10-15 minutes.  That's much too long in my opinion.  She came over a few times to say they were coming, but I guess the bartenders were so backed up they weren't making the waiters drinks.  The place was rather busy, but didn't seem so full that they shouldn't be able to pour a few glasses of wine quicker than they did.  Even though she was new, she was very knowledge about the menu and was able to answer all our questions and give some pointers.  \n\nWe started out with a half dozen Jumbo Shrimp ($11).  They were served on an ice platter with cocktail sauce and lemons, and were very jumbo and sweet and good!  You do have to peel them, which is totally fine by me, but I know some people hate having to touch or do anything with their food.  I got the crabmeat maison salad with \nfresh herbs, local greens and country bread croutons.  This was delicious!  The country bread croutons were thinly sliced crostini pieces that came in a cute little container along side the salad plate.  The crabmeat was sweet and there was just the right amount of mayonnaise (not too much) for my liking.  My friend got the roasted beets salad with Bayou blue cheese and spiced pistachios.  She wasn't too impressed.  It was 95% lettuce, and a very few thinly sliced beets on the bottom.  It didn't have anything to make it interesting.  \n\nWe ordered a second drink, and it too took forever to come.  We also felt like we waited forever in between courses.  The bottom line was the kitchen and staff were just too busy to get things moving.  The manager was well aware, because she was circling the dining room trying to check in on everyone and make nice since quite a few people were looking around for their food and drinks.  I will say the waitress was super apologetic about it and at least acknowledged that the wait times were rather longer than they should be.\n\nWe finally got our main courses, and they were delicious!  On main courses, I'd give this place a 4 out of 5.  I got the shrimp and grits ($22) with delicious little bits of andouille thrown in for good measure.  It was served in a small cast-iron skillet and was piping hot and buttery and good!!!!  I could've eaten a whole giant cast-iron skillet of it!  The andouille was the perfect thing to contrast the buttery shrimp and grits. My friend got the smoked pork shank, Mangalitsa belly & bratwurst, with house-made sauerkraut ($23).  Both of our mouths dropped when this got delivered.  If you've ever been to Germany, this plate was exactly what you get in every bar.  A GIANT pork shank, with tons of other pork products.  It was so big she didn't even know how to start tackling eating it.  The sauerkraut was very interesting.  it was really quite sweet, but both of us liked it.  It was just different than normal sauerkraut.  The pork shank was perfectly smoked and had great flavor and tenderness.  The sausage was also delicious, and of course pork belly is always good.  Talk about a rich dish though.  My goodness!  And talk about seriously large portions...she didnt' even come close to finishing the meal.  I think a table of 3 could've shared this as one entree and been fine.  For reals.  it was big. \n\n\nWe were so full we couldn't even look at the dessert menu.  We had also been there for so long we were tired and wanted to go home.  I think it was over 2 hours for dinner, which is totally fine when you're in that mood, but neither of us really were.  The timing was very off, but if you're there on a not busy night, I bet you'd love it!  \n\nI also thought the pricing was very good for what you get.  The wines by the glass options were extensive too, and they do them all by the glass or 1/4 or 1/2 carafe.  That was a nice touch.", "date": "2012-01-20 02:13:40"}

I have to say that if I had eaten at this restaurant in any other city it would probably get five stars, but I ate so well while I was there that I have to compare it to the local competition, including on of John Besh's other restaurants Domenica.  Came here on a Saturday night and went with the nightly specially which is a really good deal.  For $23 you get soup, entree and a dessert.  I started with their seafood gumbo, although I was really tempted to order the matzo ball soup cause come on what's matzo ball soup doing on the menu here?  The gumbo was the best I had on my trip.  The entree on Saturday night was the rabbit stew.  I'd never eaten rabbit before but I figured I'd give it a try.  It was pretty good, not great and I wouldn't order it again.  The chef went a little too heavy on the salt, and the beans in it were way too smokey tasting for my liking.  The rabbit itself was good.  For dessert, it came with the bread pudding which was served with bourbon ice cream.  It was really good but after a meal that big it was a little too rich and I couldn't eat that much.  I wish I could've gotten a rain check for dessert and come back the next day.

I enjoyed watching the oyster man hard at work cracking oyster shells and placing them neatly on ice trays. Who knew it was such hard work? \n\nWe started off with turtle soup (our favorite)...but weren't too happy when it was served lukewarm.

We ordered the boudin noir.  Having lived in Louisiana during graduate school, we know a thing or two about boudin and were looking forward to it.  Must be good -- it's a John Besh restaurant, right?  Wrong.  The waiter could have told us that this boudin is blood sausage that keeps it REAL.  By keepin' it real, I mean there must have been a gallon of blood cooked down to make this sausage.  I know that some people like this, but come on, at least warn us.  It was inedible.  My husband asked for it to be removed from the table so that he could enjoy the rest of the food.\n\nFried oyster salad was very good, but it needed something to take it over the top.  Like a tangy bit of cheese, perhaps.  I'd still recommend it to you for a lunch.  Maybe you could ask for a little goat or bleu cheese with it!\n\nRaw oysters were, well, raw oysters.  They were excellent.  It was a bit of a challenge getting the crackers and cocktail sauce all together from a server.\n\nEtoufee of blue crab and brown shrimp on pasta was very good.

The restaurant was fairly busy when i walked in and told the hostess that there was just 1 person.  She replied, you can go to the bar to try to find a seat and if not, we can try to find a seat in the restaurant... a weird greeting but I was hungry from just getting off a plane so I managed to \"find\" a seat at the small bar.  I waited 10 minutes to get acknowledged by the bartender who said hi and asked if I wanted dinner.  After replying, he gave me a menu and walked away.. I guess I am not thirsty this evening.  \n\nHe came back and asked if I knew what I wanted to eat.  So I started with my drink order and then ordered the \"Jumbo\" Shrimp and Grits; figuring NO would produce a decent sized shrimp given that is what it is known for (amongst other things).  After about 35 minutes of waiting, my food finally came.  There were 6 shrimp on the plate, all of which pale in comparison to a jumbo shrimp you would buy at any grocery store.  These shrimp were TINY; about the size of a medium or small frozen shrimp you would get at a Fry's/Kroger or Safeway in a bag.  The Grits was not to my liking but I think that was a personal opinion and not a complaint about the food.  The shrimp did have a good flavor I just wish they were \"jumbo\" as advertised.  \n\nThe bartender did not ask how my meal was at all and did not offer me another drink once during my meal despite the fact that my glass was empty when my food was brought out.  My meal was all I got, meaning that I did not get any bread as some people indicated they received and it did not come with a side salad.  For a $24 plate, one would think it would at least come with one of those two options; but I was not expecting much from this bartender.  \n\nBeing that I was not full off of 6 shrimp, i ordered the bread pudding, which was very good.  I highly recommend!\n\nAll in all, the food was overpriced for what I got so be prepared to spend a decent chunk of change at this restaurant.  The bar had TVs but maybe they were there for decoration as they were not on (it was 7:00pm) Maybe go to a different restaurant and then come here for dessert.  Or come here when it's not busy or not before Mardi Gras weekend....", "date": "2012-02-23 18:14:14"}

It seemed strange to me, as people on the streets were raging outside, why this restaurant was as deserted as it was. I soon found out the reason.\n\nTHE FOOD was definitely not my cup of tea. We were feeling adventurous and ordered the P\u00e2t\u00e9 of Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers and Pied de cochon\n\"croustillant\" off the Charcuterie section. NOT WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING. Apart from the fact that we did not speak French and had NO idea what we were ordering, the waiter made no attempt to help us despite our questioning gazes. When they arrived, the croustillant turned out to be two small pieces of deep-fried undistinguishable meat (or pig's feet meat, not that we could tell). We couldn't see where the Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers were, but on the other plate was a jar full of questionable jam. We soon found out the \"jam\" was actually the \"p\u00e2t\u00e9\" of the livers. Ech.\n\nTHE SERVICE was pretty absent (or should I say absentminded?). When we first entered the restaurant, the host was talking on the phone with her friend/SO, and even though we stood right in front of her, she kept on giggling to the person on the other end of the phone. It wasn't until a man with a managerial vibe stood behind her that she hung up the phone and showed us to our seats. Our waiter clearly was not really paying attention. He told us he would bring us water with lemons and straws, and it took him 30 minutes to bring just the water, without the lemons and straws (but I guess I must be too picky). When it was time to ring up the check, he brought us a check totaling $100. Um excuse me? No way two deep-fried balls and a jar of pate could cost $100. We had to wait for him to come around to ask him if it was the right check. So in total: \nTime we spent waiting for service = 1-2 hours\nTime we spent eating = 10 minutes\nGet the picture?\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE was pretty good. Dim lighting gave off a romantic kind of feel.

The service was top quality, despite our huge party.\n\nThe bread that was given prior to the 1st dish had an outer crust that was firm, yet crisp.

Each spoonful was filled with the crab's distinct taste, but left my pallet with a light spice. Personally, I felt like the bisque lacked in a balance of flavor that I was expecting and was a bit too salty. Perhaps that crab and saltiness could have been tapered down a bit.\n\nFor the 2nd dish, I had shrimp and andouille over creamy white grits. The dish gave off a wondrous aroma. The shrimp was not as \"jumbo\" as I expected them to be, but each packed a flavorful punch. The shrimps carried that bold, Cajun flavor but was not overwhelming. The grits balanced out the the shrimp by providing that neutral flavor to refresh the pallet.\n\nFor dessert, I had bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce.

Why you ask? This place has great food, great decor, and reasonable prices for a quality restaurant. However, it does lose a quarter of a star because I saw some less than spectacular service/performance going on. \n\nThis place is split up into two sections, a back area and a front area. The front area has the bar and a few tables, the back area has the open kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook and where you can have bigger parties sit.\n\nI came here the first time for dinner; my friends were going to Restaurant August and I didn't have that kinda cash, so I settled for another of Besh's Restaurants, which is how I ended up here. At $22 plus or minus a plate, I would not call this place cheap, but it is a discount compared to the alternative. I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp En Coccotte. It was 5 or 6 shrimps served on top of creamy grits in a cast iron skillet. The flavors were absolutely amazing, very savory and complimented the grits. I also tried the creme brulee and the Galette aux fraise t for dessert, both were very tasty. The creme brulee had fresh fruit and was excellently done. The Galette was like a strawberry danish with a scoop of ice cream. Good but not amazing. Before we left, one of the busboys, who kinda reminds me of Kenneth from 30 rock, recommended that we try the pancakes for brunch. He told us they were delicious, but could not tell us why. We took his advice anyways and came back for brunch. We ordered a stack of Mimi's pancakes (comes with 6 pancakes) and a side of home fries. The pancakes were some of the best I have ever had, unfortunately I cannot explain why. They are just good. The home fries came with onions and Allan Benton's bacon. This was the first time I had ever had Benton's bacon, and it was just soo good that I had to order some to go. Both times I came here, the food was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe only down side to my experience was a couple of servers. Our server was Chris, and he seemed like he just did not care very much. He did the bare minimum to be our server including checking in on us, and refilling drinks. When asked about the shrimps, he just said they were good (which to his credit they were), but he did not describe them in any sense. You would think a waiter would know what they are serving. I also saw another server eating a handful of fries, from his hand, while working, and in sight of the customers. That just seems like something that would be frowned upon wherever you go. And that is where the half a star went. The other servers and staff members were very nice and helpful.\n\nOverall, very good food, helpful staff and I will visit here again when I get a chance.", "date": "2012-03-19 02:33:05"}

I sampled some of my friends' dishes as well, all were good.\n\nThe bummer here was the service.  The waitress seemed flustered and not very knowledgeable (perhaps she was new?).   I ordered a bottle of champagne and after waiting 20 minutes (the rest of our 15 person party had already been served their drinks), she informed me that they were checking at the bar to see if they had a cold bottle.  Okay, no worries.  Another 10-15 minutes later, she comes back to tell me they weren't sure they had it at all, and asked if I had a second choice.  Well, after another wait, it turned they didn't have my second choice either.  By then I was getting frustrated (by this time, some of our party was on their second round of drinks, and we all had our first courses on the table), so when she came back to ask me for a third choice, I asked her if we could just cut to the chase and could she just tell me what they DID have!  She brought me two tasting size glasses to try, I took a little sip out of each and picked one of the two.\n\nTHEN SHE TOOK THEM BOTH AWAY.  Thanks lady, I already have to wait one more time for my bottle of champagne, and now you're going to leave me drinkless again?  I can understand if you take away the one I don't want, but sheesh, leave me the two sips left in the glass of the one I ordered.  I'd hate to imagine what the service would have been like if I had just ordered one glass and not a full bottle - not that it should make any difference in the service, but I was once a waitress myself, and we all know that a bigger check usually equals a bigger tip.  The more you can get on that check, the better.\n\nIf the bottle service had been more prompt, a second one would have likely been ordered.  But by the time we got the first bottle and finished it, everyone else in our group was pretty much done eating and drinking.  The food is easily 4 star as expected from a John Besh joint, but the drink experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, I'd hesitate to go back.

My table of New Yorkers (accustomed to $3 oysters) almost died from both sticker shock, and then the amount of seafood consumed. The oysters were HUGE and unlike anything I've ever experienced. Oysters and horseradish sauce? Never would have thought. Now, a combo I cannot forget. \n\nOn to the most amazing appetizer of all time : Pate of rabbit and chicken livers. Absolutely, to die for. Along with the crispy bread for the pate, the app comes with delicious mustard and PICKLED WATERMELON bits. Together, a perfect marriage of flavors. This best $10 ever spent is what sold us on staying for dinner.\n\nDinner: I got the jagerschnitzel. This consisted of a gigantic amount of veal covering a layer of home made pasta in bacon mushroom sauce. Everyone tried it. Everyone LOVED it. I am not typically into gigantic portions but brought home easily another huge meals worth. \n\nLastly, and certainly not least: for the duration of most of our meal, drinks were at happy hour pricing.

Unfortunately, I was not much impressed. \n\nFirst of all, the service was extremely slow. It was just under 30 minutes from the time we sat down until our drinks arrived... and the rest of the meal followed the same unhurried theme. Luckily for us, we were celebrating a birthday with another couple, so we were happy to sit and talk for a couple of hours, but any other time, and I would definitely have been annoyed with the slow and inattentive service.\n\nThe food was all good, but nothing spectacular. We started off with the assiette de charcuterie, which is an assortment of duck prosciutto, p\u00e2t\u00e9, and different relishes and mustards to accompany. It was all good. We also had the escargot au gratin... now this was the best part of the meal... it was delicious. The veal glace and red wine used to prepare it was mixed perfectly... and it was served with delicious bread for dipping, it was very good. \n\nFor entre, I had the Jagerschnitzel, which contains paneed veal cutlets atop pasta, all covered in a mushroom sauce. The sauce was clearly underserved, with only a little on top of the veal, and not nearly enough for the pasta underneath. The pictures I saw here on Yelp of the same meal show quite a bit more sauce... so, with the little sauce that was on the plate, it left the meal rather bland. \n\nMy wife had the shrimp and grits... I stole a bite, and that was all I wanted. You can get very good plates of shrimp and grits all over the city of New Orleans, and this was not one of them... \n\nFor dessert, we split the bread pudding. Once again, it was ok, but nothing special. It had some vanilla ice cream on top and a pecan sauce... but once you got through the top layer, the bottom half of the bread pudding was bland and dry. We didn't finish it. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: It was ok... the service was slow and the food was moderate at best. I can think of 10 different places in the same price range and with a similar menu selection that I would rather go to, so it is unlikely that I will return to Luke.", "date": "2012-06-10 04:59:04"}

I was treating myself to a full dinner, and dining solo, I was a bit worried that service would be \"meh\" as it often is at finer places. Rather, my waiter was fantastic. When I told him I hadn't really had raw oysters before, but was curious, he fetched me two on the house to try out (resulting in something yummy!). And, when I had a little green organic visitor in my salad - showing that everything was extremely fresh - they took care of me. I didn't care much, as it wasn't something that signaled a lack of cleanliness. But, they swooped on in without a word, took my plate, and dashed off. The manager swung by, and apologized profusely, swearing that everything was 'taken care of'. And, he wouldn't let me argue (I seriously didn't mind paying!).\n\nEverything I had - a full five courses - was delectable. Not to mention, they made a darned good Old Fashioned.\n\nSince then, I've craved a return visit here. And, two weeks ago, I was in town and had just killed off the better part of Saturday walking around the Garden District... exhausted and in dire need of a light bite and a beer before the wedding I was set to attend that evening, I made a special hike over to Luke. \n\nI got there in the middle of their happy hour which is everyday (weekends too!) from 3-6pm and includes $.50 oysters and half-priced drinks (I think there are some that aren't, but many/most are). I sat at the bar, ordered a full dozen and a house beer, and found myself remiss to leave in time to hoof it way back to my room to shower and change for the wedding.\n\nNow, the oysters weren't as good as the ones I had two days before at Felix's, but... for $.50/ea. and decent conversation with the bartenders, it was a welcome stop at the end of a long, hot, tiring day.\n\nI will return again on my next trip.

The fried oysters weren't greasy at all- crispy outside and creamy inside.  So far so good!\n\nThe entrees were good but not great.  Wife had the grilled gulf fish with crawfish, artichokes, and mushrooms.  The portion looked a bit small, and the fish although cooked well tended to have a bit too much pepper in the seasoning.  I had the roast chicken which came in a nice cast iron pot with steamed veggies and garlic mash potatoes.  I gave the drumstick to my wife and she loved it- meat falling off the bone and crispy skin.  I felt the test of the chicken had good taste for the most part, and you do need to eat the meat with the skin.  The chicken was slightly overcooked around the breast unfortunately.  A pretty good dish, but still a notch below Thomas Keller's Bouchon chicken dish.

I ordered the steak with fries and my boyfriend  got the pork shank with bratwurst and sauerkraut. All I could taste was the garlic butter on the steak vs the meat itself, fries were great. And the bratwurst looked disgusting and tasted like nothing but a weak beer, the pork was HUGE but  good, and the sauerkraut was soggy finely cut cabbage. \n\nThe down and dirty? The table next to us ordered burgers, they were super cold when they were brought out, lady and husband  took a bite, very very nicely sent it back and when they brought the burgers out less than 5 minutes later they just microwaved the burgers and added new fries after telling the table they would make new ones....and the food was still cold!

My partner got them baked which smelled divide topped with their garlicky cheesy goodness. The beet salad was good too although the beets were cooked a little longer than I normally like. The dressing was the perfect tangy amount of top. I chose the ribeye with saut\u00e9ed vegetables on the server's suggestion. This is the main reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of 4.

Luke (or Louuuuke) is a great place that (as it appears) tons of Yelpers flock to. Being brought here is a delicious technicality.\n\nFor me, N'Orleans fare goes a really long way; not that I don't love it; but I love it more when I have it less. My colleague ordered everything in oysters, and I mean everything. While he slurped away, I fell in love with my bisque. How can something so decadent and buttery, still taste light and sweet? \n\nOur drinks did not arrive during this wonderful appetizer round, though. That they had a crowd was putting it mildly. It's at these moments you can take in the decor: that being warm and relaxed, which I also loved. Our table was located very close to 3 other diners: I could have grabbed a handful of pickles from each of them. \n\nWhen our main meal arrived we were not disappointed. The cracked crab was amazing; amazing enough for all to worship at it's altar; it was coupled with a light slaw that was not knee deep in mayo; but spicy and tangy and on my plate it was gone! It came with a grilled stuffed tomato that was loaded with a crab and cheese mixture with a definite kick! Awesome.\n\nMy colleague ordered what many seemed to be ordering: the crab bit; in addition to fried green tomatoes. He seemed to have no complaints because he leveled his plate.\n\nOur drinks came at the end of the meal, and it's a good thing too because by then our pH levels had altered dramatically. Though attentive in certain areas, the service was not \"up there\". But the food at Luke was wonderful.\n\nThey say everyone has a \"double\".

I love raw oysters, but being from Houston, the closest thing we get to fresh raw oysters are those from Galveston... and I'm not into the whole \"flesh-eating-bacteria\" thing. Needless to say, I try to avoid food poisoning from some of the seafood on our end of the Gulf. \n\nLuke... OH LUKE RESTAURANT. (Must still be the aphrodisiacs talking). Ha. My boyfriend and I came to Luke's with every intention to order the $.50 oysters and cocktails for happy hour (3-6pm everyday). However, after perusing the menu we saw Luke's \"le plateau de fruits de mer\" and had to order it. This platter is like a seafood heaven for seafood lovers. We started with two bloody mary's, ordered a bunch of seafood, and ended the night with a cappuccino and hot tea. \n\nThe bloody mary's were good and the best part, is they were half price! Their cocktail menu features drinks ranging from their take on the peach bellini to stronger beverages of choice like scotch or french75's. Luke's has a cocktail menu that should please all high class taste buds. \n\nNow onto the main meal, picture this; a two-level tower exquisitely displaying 12 plump raw oysters, 8 huge shrimp, 5 clams, 12 sweet mussels, Alaskan King crab legs, dungeonous crab legs/body & squid/octopus ceviche with lemons, and saltines scattered around this goodness all for $58. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Not only did we completely pig out on this tower, but we also ordered a half dozen baked/roasted oysters (A MUST TRY for anyone who loves oysters). \n\nLet's start with the raw oysters, these things were gigantic and so fresh. No grimy fishy taste and we slurped these up without hesitation. The baked oysters were fantastic. I can't even find the words to describe them, they've got this lightly salted, buttery, bread crumb topping and the oysters are baked to perfection. Their texture is still reminiscent of a raw oyster, but without all the \"slime/juice.\" And, they're hot hot hot fresh outta the oven. Yum! The Alaskan King crab legs were not salty at all (which is a very good thing in my books). I hate it when king crab legs taste like saltwater, these crab legs at Luke had the fresh sweet taste of crab not compromised by seasonings or salt and I'm a huge fan. In fact, I'm dreaming about this whole meal as I speak. \n\nIf you're only in NOLA for a day and need some good food and drinks, come to Luke for happy hour. Or in our case, venture off the HH menu and order something from their main dinner menu. There is only one restaurant that I will purposely take a 3.5 hour road trip to go and eat at but with the addition of Luke restaurant being added onto that list, it looks like I'll be driving back and forth from Houston to NOLA a lot more often!

I didn't like that even though the restaurant only had two other customers there they put us in a tiny tiny minature two person table because we ordered alot of food and there was no room on the table.

Who doesn't want to experience Reveillon when they're in NOLA?\n\nThere's a lot that's good about this restaurant. There's also a lot that isn't quite up to par.\n\nPros:\n- Happy Hour: 50-cent oysters? Pretty sure I died and went to heaven. And they were huge, succulent, deliciously briny Gulf Coast oysters! Some were easily twice the size of normal oysters\n- Delicious cocktails: Seeing as they were half off because of HH, I indulged and got both the Champagne au Peche (Champagne and fresh peach puree) and the St. Charles Streetcar (St. Germain, pear vodka, Champagne). Both were tasty and refreshing\n\nCons:\n- The Reveillon menu left a lot to be desired. For the first course, my boyfriend got the shrimp remoulade and I got the crispy sweetbread with beluga lentils and blood orange brown butter vinaigrette. The remoulade was flavorless and forgettable. The sweetbread was actually well-cooked (very crisp) but got to be too rich after a while.\n- The turtle soup and seafood gumbo that made up our second course were both terrible. There was maybe a kernel of turtle meat in the entire bowl of soup and the gumbo lacked seasoning. Our third course consisted of crispy flounder stuffed with crab, shrimp and mirliton dressing, and a rib roast with oyster dressing, turnip and apple puree, and cherry compote. - \n- The roast was decent if a bit chewy, but the flounder was so rich that my boyfriend couldn't finish it. \n- Our final course was dessert--bread pudding with vanilla ice-cream and hot buttered pecan sauce for him, apple tart with caramel and praline ice-cream for me. The praline ice-cream was great, but the bread pudding was too sweet in my opinion and the apple tart was virtually inedible on account of being too dry.\n- Service was also disappointing for a restaurant with this reputation. Our server was nice enough, but she would disappear for long blocks of time during inopportune moments when we really needed her\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I did a Reveillon dinner in NOLA, but I don't think I'll be recommending Luke to anyone.", "date": "2013-01-03 07:22:07"}

Not to mention that 50 cent price tag during happy hour - SAY NO MORE, I shall come and gladly slurp up as many of these incongruously delicious shellfish as my stomach can handle!

I salute you and thank you.)\n\nThe oysters at Luke's? Huge. HUGE. The closest equivalent happy hour we have in LA are $1 at Enterprise and they are completely rink-a-dink compared to the one at Luke's. Not only that, but they were perfectly balanced and briny - so tasty, especially with a dash of minuet sauce, horseradish and Tabasco!

The bacon was a nice addition but it made it just a bit too salty for my tastes.\n\nI'm not very well-versed on charcuterie, so I don't think my opinion on that would be very helpful.  Shrimp and grits, though.. I had to basically ju-jitsu my friend Sophia to wrestle this dish from her, since she loved it so much.  Understandably so - some of the best grits I've ever had.

The fiance and I had been served one of the best meals of our lives at Luke's San Antonio location, so when I asked him what he thought about booking Luke New Orleans for our reception, it was an easy sell.\n\nFor your party or reception, Luke is extremely affordable, especially considering the other options in town.  They have two rooms available for rental--one is a private room that can be closed off, suitable for smaller groups, and a semiprivate wine room that's for larger parties.  Our reception will be in the wine room, and we were coincidentally seated nearby, so we could sneak a peek at what it was going to look like.  What did it take to secure our date?  Only a contract saying we would commit to a $1000 minimum, no deposit needed.  Sign me up!\n\nWhen we signed the contract, I inquired about gluten-free options since the fiance is gluten-intolerant and was told the chef would accommodate all food allergies. Anyone who has an allergy as all-encompassing as gluten will give that statement some major side-eye.  But I'm skeptical no longer.  When we were seated, we asked our server about gluten-free options and he went back into the kitchen to talk to the chef.  \"I'm sorry we don't have an actual gluten free menu,\" he told us when he came back, but he went through EVERY. SINGLE. ENTREE. on the dinner menu and told us if it was safe or how they could make it safe (grilling a fish fillet instead of dredging it in flour, for example).  For gluten-free folks and the people who love them, this is the equivalent of a unicorn sighting.  You are told more often than not you can just have a burger without the bun, or something equally deflating.  In fact, our server was so knowledgeable about gluten, he even joked about bring us a bread basket.\n\nWith the menu opened up to him, my fiance chose a dish of house-made bratwurst, pork shank, pork belly and sauerkraut, and I ordered the shrimp and grits.  His entree was a true mountain of meat, each component of it outstanding.  I don't even LIKE sauerkraut and I found myself stealing nibbles here and there.  And the shrimp and grits--ye gods.  I'd had it in San Antonio, so I knew it was good, but it was a pretty excellent reminder.  With bits of Andouille sausage sprinkled into the mix, the fiance and I agreed this one is DEFINITELY going on the wedding day menu. He remarked that usually due to cross-contamination he feels at least a little crummy after he eats at a restaurant, but that his meal at Luke left him without any--er, shall we say, inner turmoil.\n\nService was wonderful--the word that I keep coming up to describe it is \"easy\".  Not because it's simple, but because it felt so natural.  We truly felt taken care of during our meal, which is not an easy feat on a busy Friday night.\n\nSpeaking of which, if you're going on the weekend (and maybe even not) I would highly recommend reservations.  Running late after my bridal portraits and still needing to dress for dinner, I called Luke and asked if my 6:30 reservation could be moved to 7.  No can do, I was told.  I basically disrobed in a flurry, dressed, and we just short of ran to get there on time.  In fact, en route a passerby yelled at me \"Slow down, little lady, you're in New Orleans!\"  SORRY BUDDY CAN'T SLOW DOWN MUST GET SHRIMP AND GRITS.\n\nWith our stellar experience at Luke New Orleans, I'm looking forward to our reception even MORE now--if that's possible--and I'll update after our wedding day.", "date": "2013-02-01 23:48:48"}

The food was good, but not quite up-to-par with what I expected after reading the reviews.  Considering that it is in New Orleans on Super Bowl weekend, the overall value was decent.\n\nCOCKTAILS\nAfter a long weekend of indulging in local beer, we tried their Old Fashioned.  It was well executed and smooth.  I'm a big bourbon fan, and I appreciate the balance in this cocktail.\n\nAPPETIZERS\nI had the Rillette of Local Pork with savory marmalades and grilled country bread.  This was a rather large portion that may be better for sharing.  It's like a pork pat\u00e9 in a short, wide jar.  The pork was flavorful and served as a good base for the accompaniments, however if you don't like pat\u00e9, you probably won't like this dish.  The savory marmalades were not quite what I thought they would be.  There were four items: 1) grainy mustard (which I loved), 2) a sort of pepper relish that was a a little sweet and savory (a good complement to the pork), 3) a kind of pickled diced peach (a bit too crunchy and sour for my liking), and 4) some brined/lightly pickled half slices of pickling cucumbers (I didn't care for this even though I love pickles).  The grilled bread had a nice crunch without being too crispy or dry.  I think this appetizer would go well with a malty, lightly hopped beer-perhaps the local Abita Amber.\n\nMy friend had the Seafood Gumbo and enjoyed it quite a bit.  He commented that there were nice chunks of seafood and sausage (presumably andouille).\n\nENTREES\nI had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"en cocotte\" (aka Shrimp & Grits).  Our waiter said that this was the dish that they are known for and I'm a sucker for shrimp & grits, so I had to have it.  Also, other Yelp reviewers had hyped this dish quite a bit.  Although it was very good, I don't think it's the best I've ever had as some other reviewers have stated.  The shrimp were large, plump and well cooked - perhaps ever so slightly overcooked.  This may be due to the shrimp sitting in the hot grits and continuing to cook a bit.  The grits were excellent, but I thought they could be a touch smoother.  These comments may be nitpicks, but they were what made the difference in me really enjoying it vs. swooning over it.  Overall this dish was very satisfying.  The flavors were layered well and the savory, creamy combination worked well.\n\nMy friend had the Poulet Grand-Mere.  From the pictures on Yelp, this looked like a great, homey, comfort-food dish.  Perfect after a long, cool, rainy day.  It's a half herb roasted local chicken served with bacon, veggies, and whipped potatoes.  Everything looked delicious and the crispy roasted chicken skin looked great.  However the problem was with the chicken.  It seems like they may have pre-roasted the chicken and reheated it for service!  When my friend pulled the drumstick off, he noticed that the meat inside close to the bone was actually cool to the touch.  When he pointed that out to our server, the dish was whisked back to the kitchen and a new dish was prepared.  The young lady who later returned with a fresh serving apologized nicely and expressed that this is not their standard.  However, the second time around was no better than the first! THE CHICKEN WAS COOL INSIDE AGAIN!  I could not believe it and my friend decided to go ahead and eat it anyway since it was getting late, he was hungry, and I was already halfway through my dinner.  After alerting our server of the second mishap, they rightfully took this dish off our bill and did not charge us for dessert.  This was an appropriate response on their part, however it was not sufficient to give me faith that the execution of this dish will be better in the future.  I was shocked that a John Besh restaurant would have such an issue.\n\nDESSERT\nI had the Apple Gallette with ice cream.  The apples were tasty, well-cooked, and well-seasoned.  The ice cream (pecan, I think?) was very good and paired well with the Gallette.  The pastry itself was a bit disappointing.  Parts of it were the flaky pastry it ought to be, but the outer parts were chewy and tough.  Overall it did not taste that fresh and I suspect that some corners were cut with this dish.  I would not order this again or recommend it to anyone else.\n\nMy friend had the bread pudding and enjoyed it.  It came smothered with sauce and ice cream, so I don't think I would have enjoyed it (I'm a bit of a bread pudding purist).\n\nSUMMARY\nDon't order the chicken!  The cocktails we tried were great and the service was pretty good, but a little more formal than I expected for a bistro.  The portions are generous.  Good, not great, food.  I'd go back, but have to deduct a star for the chicken.", "date": "2013-02-07 14:22:45"}

This was an incredibly satisfying and enjoyable experience.\n\nWe started the excellent meal with one more shot at the Turtle Soup. As I said in previous reviews, it was decent enough, but I'll be OK if I never eat the stuff again for the rest of my life. We also got the Rillette of Local Pork ($9). They give you a very very generous amount, paired with a lot of crispy bread to smear it on. There was so much we couldn't even finish it all.\n\nFor the entrees, we got the Luke Burger ($16.50), which was awesome. Such a good burger, covered in onions, bacon and swiss cheese, it was one of the better burgers I've had recently. The house-made fries it comes with were also insanely good - nice and salty and piping hot and crispy. We also got the Poultry Gran-mere ($19), which was also delicious. The chicken was so soft and tender it was all pretty much fallen off the bone and delicious in the stew of vegetables and mashed potatoes it was sitting in.\n\nTo end the meal, even though we were stuffed, we went for two desserts to sustain us until midnight for the New Year's Eve countdown. We got the Apple Gallete ($8) and Brendan's Bread Pudding ($8). Both were delicious, but I really loved the bread pudding. This was one of my favorite versions of the many I had during the trip (probably second only to the Chocolate version at Red Fish Grill).\n\nThe service is also perfect. The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly, and you get the full white glove treatment. This is an excellent option for a satisfying meal from the Besh empire of restaurants. There is not much else on the menu that I feel the need to return for, though it definitely made me want to go and try the rest of his places the next time I am in town.", "date": "2013-02-09 13:51:04"}

The girlfriend has been wanting to go here so I decided to surprise her with some reservations.  Got reservations for 4pm to avoid the big crowds and take advantage of happy hour.  Show up on time and as soon as I walk through the door it starts going down hill.  \n\nThe bar is packed (nothing wrong with that) and there are maybe 20% of the tables full.  None of the sections are busy.  Tell the hostess the name on the reservations and she looks around confused with a look on her face like where is she going to possibly sit us. It took 10 mins to sit us when almost all the tables were available but whatever, I ignored it.  Water came right away...took a little bit for the waiter to show who was obviously new...again, no big deal.  Ordered some drinks and oysters on the half shell.  Can't beat their happy hour prices.  In the mean time a 2 more couples came into the section we were in.  Drinks came with no oysters.  No big deal until both of the couples that sat after us got oysters along with several other orders coming out from the bar.  Let our server know, he apologized, came back with oysters and blamed it on them losing our ticket at the bar.\n\nStill trying to manage a positive outlook...ordered some appetizers and main course.  Appetizers came, she had the bisque and I the escargot.  Mine was good, hers bland.  Not 3 mins after we got our appetizers the main course came.  Not acceptable especially since we had a table barely large enough to handle what was already on it.  The server who was not our waiter apologized without me having to say anything and took the food back.  Problem is when they brought the main course back out they may have well just left it on the table beside us.  It was cold.  I ordered a rib-eye which isn't wonderful cold but edible.  She had the hamburger everyone talks about.  Well, the problem with hamburgers is no matter how good they are made...they suck cold.  Fries cold too.  Horrible.  \n\nSo that's my Luke experience.  I'm sure without the errors of the staff it would've been a much better experience and if the food would've been presented at the right time the taste would have been better.

Unfortunately this experience was VERY disappointing. There were so many missteps, it was almost a joke. We basically had 5 different people dealing with us throughout the night, but even five people weren't able to deliver decent service. The sommelier was apparently new and was not knowledgeable about the wine list so someone else was sent over to try to help. When we asked him to describe a certain Cabernet and a Merlot, the man said he didn't like either, as he only drank Zinfandel and Shiraz. I don't care what your personal preferences are or how long you've been at a restaurant - if you claim to be a sommelier or have knowledge of the wine list, you should be able to describe the wines on the list! One redeeming factor that came out of this was that our first bottle of wine was pretty awful, so the sommelier offered to let us a) try another one to see if we liked that and b) then offered to give it to us for the price of the first bottle (which was about $8 less). \n\nOur waiter was simply incompetent and totally inattentive. First of all, when he brought out bread, he only brought out 3 plates, and then sort of looked confused before going to get two more. When we went to order food (which took some time because he disappeared for a while), we had a couple questions about food preparations, and he was very terse in his responses and made himself sound very unknowledgeable about the menu. For example, I asked what shrimp \"en cocotte\" was and his response was \"Grilled\". That's it. Well I was somewhat curious, so after googling this, I discovered that \"en cocotte\" means cooked in one pot. This was completely different from the response I got unless the shrimp were grilled and then returned to the pot with the other ingredients, but I have no idea since I received no real answer to my question. Similarly, my friend was trying to decide between the two pat\u00e9s on the menu, and the waiter recommended one over the other because \"it came with more things\". Well this isn't really the point in ordering and being able to enjoy food so she was a bit frustrated by that. After we ordered, that was pretty much the last we saw of our waiter who was supposedly completely overwhelmed dealing with a large group in another room. The restaurant didn't seem overly busy, given that it was a Sunday night, so if he wasn't able to handle more than one table, someone else should have been assigned to ours. Our first course plates hadn't been cleared when our main courses were brought out, and the new person who brought us our mains didn't take the time to clear these plates so we sort of had to move them out of the way ourselves while he set down our new plates, and only after he had done this did he proceed to clear the first course plates. Additionally, no one ever came over to re-fill our wine glasses - not saying that we're snobby and need to have our wine poured by a waiter, but empty wine glasses would be noticed if anyone ever stopped by our table, and it's usually safe to say that this service can be expected at a restaurant of this caliber. The woman who came over to clear our entr\u00e9e plates was thankfully quite friendly and offered to bring us dessert menus pretty quickly. One of my friends had ordered the \"Express Menu\" which came with dessert (bread pudding), and when she asked if she could choose a different dessert (since they were all the same price), the woman said that wouldn't be a problem and that we should just let our server know...and then she looked around and decided she would just take our order since our water \"was a little pre-occupied\" (I'm glad someone finally acknowledged this). \n\nOur waiter re-appeared (shocker!) to ask if there was anything else he could get us before bringing us the check, but he almost seemed annoyed by having to stop by our table. Now our group was not very demanding and we are all typically pretty easy-going so we weren't sure what his problem was, especially since he'd been by our table a total of maybe 4 times during the evening, and we received no apology from him for being absent the whole night (not that we expected anything from him at that point). I will say that the food was pretty good, but it was all unfortunately completely overshadowed by the AWFUL service we received.", "date": "2013-03-01 21:31:20"}

LOVED the preparation that went in to the pairings which included homemade bread n' butter pickles, stone-ground mustard, some sort of amazing chutney, and pickled watermelon.

These men can cook, create a menu, make the world whole once again. \n\nRarely do I find a restaurant at which each of the three courses is executed in such flawless fashion. I started with the local oysters, which were some of the largest and sweetest I have ever tasted. I didn't even long for the mignonette which I have become accustomed to in New York; they required no added flavor besides the simple squeeze of a lemon. An order of peel and eat jumbo shrimp came on the same \"plateau\" and I couldn't have been happier. Possibly the most incredibly fresh and meaty shrimp I have ever had. For the entrees, I ordered the shrimp and crab \u00e9touff\u00e9e with fennel, saffron, and tagliatelle. This dish was rich and garlicky, but well portioned and perfectly balanced. The sauce was neither too thick nor too thin and acted as a nice compliment to the chunks of blue crab. I also tried some of the pork shank with sausage and house made sauerkraut. Now, sauerkraut is not something I'll usually write home about...it's more of a garnish or a faded memory of German home dinners to me. But this was different! It wasn't overly vinegary and had an almost sweetness that accompanied the meat instead of overpowering it. The pork was briny and fall off the bone tender, and the sausage (with a cherry mustard) was ground and packed so finely; almost the smooth texture of bologna, and amply spiced with nutmeg (perhaps even a bit TOO much nutmeg).\n\nI tried to resist dessert, but then I saw pecan bread pudding with ice cream and caramel and accepted my impending pant-size-up, plus coffee (with the freshest cream I've ever witnessed tableside). The bread pudding was soft and cinnamony, with sweetened pecans and the buttery thin caramel that just all melted in your mouth. No regrets (and I don't even normally eat gluten).\n\nI also ordered a sazerac. This led to no disappointment. In fact, the drink was so smooth, had I been feeling like getting into a bit of trouble, I would have had a few more.\n\nAs a note: yes, I DID come back here again during my short 4 day trip. It's that good.", "date": "2013-03-25 04:41:57"}

We ordered baked oysters as an appetizer and signature cocktails.  The oysters were delicious (best I've had anywhere), but our cocktails didn't show up until we had eaten all of them.\n\nThen, our entrees arrived.  We had shrimp and grits, mussels, fries, and the etouffee.  Whoever dropped off our food didn't ask us if we needed anything else or offer to refill our totally empty waters and cocktails.  We waited patiently for our waiter to come by so that we could have something to drink with our meals. \n\nWhen he didn't show up after 10 minutes of letting our food get cold, I was just about to walk up to the bar and seek out a manager, when a woman, who I assume was the manager came by to check on us.  I told her we needed 2 more cocktails, water refills, an empty bowl for the mussel shells, and some ketchup for our fries.  She got everything over to our table in a timely fashion.\n\nOverall, the food was wonderful, it's just too bad that it was tainted with such inattentive service.  Did we eventually get everything we needed to enjoy our meal?  Yes.  Do I feel that a restaurant with such a great reputation should anticipate customers basic needs more successfully?

The shrimp was served to us un-peeled, which was very reminiscent of a Las Vegas buffet. I've never dined at an upscale restaurant where you had to peel your own shrimp.  The staff wasn't very knowledgable about the oysters, admitting that they don't eat \"those thangs\" lol.  But they DO eat turtle soup and alligator, they said. Nevertheless, the oysters were relatively fresh, as were the shrimp.  The raw ones were on ice for quite a while and tasted like tap water, and the fried oysters were seasoned (unlike the ones we got at Deanies, which were horrible) but some were much more seasoned than others. We could literally see the salt on a few of them.  Anyway, Sean and Jamal kept us laughing and smiling (Miami Dolphins!), which we appreciated, but we both found Lukes to be highly overrated. Perhaps we've been spoiled by the seafood readily available here in California at reasonable prices. For instance, at Fisherman's Wharf you can get a whole dungeness or local crab plucked right from the ocean and steamed up for you for a mere $8 bucks.

I'd definitely recommend this place for after work happy hour and don't forget to check out their full raw bar.\n\nNow on to the really good stuff. My meal. A trio of Canard.\nStarter: P\u00e2t\u00e9 of Louisiana Rabbit and Duck Livers perfumed with truffle and country bread croutons\nPaired with Baron Herzog Gamay Beaujolais, 1998\n\nMain Course: Choucro\u00fbte Garnie of housemade bratwurst, slow cooked Berkshire pork shin and creamer potatoes, add Confit of Duck Leg\nPaired with Sausal Cabernet Sauvignon, 2005\n\nDessert: Duck Egg Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with fresh berry glaze\nPaired with a Cappuccino\n\nThe P\u00e2t\u00e9 was fantastically rich and smooth. It was accompanied by croutons that were unnecessarily salted. The shining star of the plate, though, were the sweet pickles of watermelon and cucumber. They were the perfect touch to cut through the bitterness and gaminess of the rabbit livers. I'm not sure what the current obsession is with gel\u00e9e but at least this top layer of gel\u00e9e melted when it touched my tongue.\n\nChoucro\u00fbte for those of you who are not familiar can be best described as a cast iron pot of meats slowly and meticulously braised to a tender mound of goodness atop a thick layer of caramelized sauerkraut. I assure you, it's nothing pretty to look at. I imagine this would be what I'd eat if I was a man's man during medieval France. It was ALL meat. Meaty tender goodness. Slightly sweet meat from the caramelized potatoes and sauerkraut. Meat that fell apart from the scooping of my fork. The immensity of the meat taunted me and challenged me and I certainly would not have been a \"man\" unless I finished the whole thing...well I AT LEAST had to keep eating until I finished the wine. :)\n\nI'd never tried duck egg cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. In fact, it never occurred to me to make cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with anything other than a (chicken) egg. Interestingly, it was not unlike cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, yet it was...different. Richer maybe. More... like it was made with an egg that could very well have just popped out of the ducky sitting in the back kitchen. Not too sweet, creamy, served room temperature as it should be. The berries were fresh and sweet and was the end to a very near perfect dinner. \n\nThe service was attentive, the server was knowledgeable about the food and wine, and the atmosphere-fun. If you're ever in New Orleans, this one is not a \"must have\" but a \"you definitely can't go wrong\". Happy eating!", "date": "2013-04-17 23:02:22"}

The restaurant didn't appear dramatically busy but we weren't in a huge hurry since our flight wasn't until later that morning. My boyfriend ordered the eggs in a jar  which was described being served with fried shrimp, cheddar grits, jalape\u00f1os, and a poached egg. He was turned off by the word \"fried\" since he didn't want a heavy breaded fried shrimp but reluctantly ordered it. I ordered the crab omelet with asparagus with a side order of Mimi's pancakes. I was happy I asked about getting a side order of pancakes since it saved $4 off the bill and you get 3 pancaked instead of 5, which is plenty. \n\nThe wait seemed like a long time considering the restaurant was not busy at all but you almost have to expect this for a nicer restaurant. After all, you are the for the experience along with the food, right? It would have been nice though to have the waiter ask if we wanted another drink or to give us an update on our order. But, 20 minutes later the food arrived. We got the shrimp and grits along with the pancakes. My boyfriend LOVED his. Perfect balance of cheese and grits, not too spicy at all, and the shrimp seemed more saut\u00e9ed than actually fried. Delightful surprise. Shrimp we're perfectly cooked and with such good flavor. I was regretting not ordering it myself but was looking forward to the omelet. Oh yeah, where was it? I only got the pancakes so far. I ate one pancake and it was okay. I mean you can't really screw up a pancake, right? The pecan butter on top was a nice change to the standard version we get in western New York though so I wasn't unhappy. \n\nSince they seated us at a small table and there was not a lot of room, I decided to have the waiter take away the pancake plate to make room for the omelet and I didn't want to overeat. After that, the waiter must have realized I didn't get my omelet yet so he quickly hurried off to the kitchen to check on it after he blamed someone else for the mistake. He brought it back finally and when I tried it, I was unhappy to taste a sweet flavor, which I later found out was mascarpone cheese. It was also barely warm. Not good overall. Plus they serve it with a side salad which, frankly, I think is bizarre. I mean, no toast? I saw they had multigrain toast on the menu though so I though I would get a quick order in so I flagged down the waiter to get some. I had maybe 2 bites of the omelet and just couldn't eat anymore so my human garbage disposal BF ate it. Thankful to not entirely waste $16, I eagerly awaited the toast. And waited. And waited. And waited. The waiter finally returned, sans the toast, and asked if the was anything else he could get us and I tried to politely remind him about the toast. Well, he apologized after he again tried to blame someone else, than ran off to the kitchen to get some. Well, the toast was burned on one side and untasted on the other. How the heck can you screw up toast? It wasn't warm and the jam it was served with was a blueberry and strawberry blend. No butter? At this point, I was pissed and we had to hurry up to check out of the hotel and catch a cab to the airport. It would have been nice if the waiter asked how our meal was. At least he didn't charge me for the toast. \n\nI would try Luke again but not for breakfast. After $75 and it being my last meal in New Orleans, I was not a happy girl. I would also not want Charles for a waiter again. I honestly expected better from a Besh restaurant. The shrimp dish deserves 5 stars though!!!", "date": "2013-04-19 20:00:42"}

Mine was very one note and the seafood was overwhelmed by the sauce it was in. My husband said his pork was very one-note as well. Our oysters were tasty but... we would have liked them better before the entrees, as we'd requested.\n\nI liked their French 75 cocktail I ordered.\n\nI wouldn't go back to Luke.", "date": "2013-05-10 19:29:28"}

After roaming the streets of New Orleans for a place to eat, I came here without realizing that this restaurant is actually attached to the Hilton next door. Luckily I hadn't known this (since I would have judged the restaurant harshly for it) and would have missed out: this one was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long time.\n\nTo start: awesome oysters - I had the half dozen with the two choices of the day - Canadian and Californian varieties. They had that lovely quality where the salty, sea taste lingers in your mouth. So delicious and fresh. Horse radish sauce and cocktail sauce on the side.\n\nI ordered one of the two house beers - L\u00fcke Alt - amber on draft. Really nice, not too heavy but with good amber flavor. It complemented the mussels really well.\n\nThe menu was amazing : the special of the day was slow cooked rabbit. With Alsascien dishes with sausages and choucroute, and German dishes like \"jagerschnitzel\", I definitely recommend this place for people who like hearty French food or German food.  Moules et frites (mussels and fries) was what I ended up choosing, though I might have ordered the rabbit if the waiter hadn't directed me to the mussels when I asked him which was better of the two.\n\nThe only drawback - there were a few TVs going; at the start of my meal, some loud claps and howls from those watching the game were kind of annoying. It wasn't that big of a deal, though, and probably only really noticeable because I was sitting at the bar right in front of one of the TVs.\n\nOrgasmically good is the only way I can describe the dessert. Sooo-ooooh good. I ordered the bittersweet chocolate mousse with dulce de leche ice cream. That is a decadent combination; the ice cream melts on top of the mousse, which is almost like a gooey brownie - and the sweetness of the ice cream complemented the bittersweet chocolate flavor.\n\nWith this top notch atmosphere, food, beer and oysters, I'm giving L\u00fcke Restaurant the 5 stars it deserves.", "date": "2013-05-20 04:05:26"}

The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. \n\nApparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.\n\nI decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.\n\nMy friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.\n\nMy boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. \n\nMy friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" with lump crab meat, roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.\n\nI have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.\n\nEven with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.\n\nOne wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.\n\nAll that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.", "date": "2013-05-29 14:29:00"}

The two stars comes in right here: I had a special, which was drum, delicious, part of the dish was a fried squash blossom stuffed with crawfish.

We asked for a quiet(er) table and were seated upstairs where we could watch the kitchen staff, who were impressively efficient and clearly enjoying their work. Though everyone was busy, all the people who helped us--the two hosts, Kyle, and another server--took time to laugh and joke with us and help us feel welcome.\n\nThe food was top-notch. My mother is a) a professional chef and b) a Jewish mother, and the matzo ball soup was almost the equal of hers: fluffy, peppery matzo balls, a superb rich broth, and delicious bits of roast chicken. When Kyle came by to check on us and I jokingly asked for a refill on the broth because I'd slurped it all up and had a giant matzo ball left to go through, he whisked away and came back a few minutes later with more broth--for which we weren't charged, even though it was practically the equivalent of another whole bowl of soup! My partner, who isn't usually much of a foodie, was rhapsodic over the poulet grand-m\u00e8re. And by our New York standards the prices were staggeringly low, especially for such good food.\n\nWith that soup in my belly I feel better than I have in days. Thanks, L\u00fcke.

The chicken was amazing.  Sometimes I am somewhat cautious about ordering something so pedestrian, but I was not disappointed.  I was given about  1/2 of a small chicken with the wing removed.  The chicken skin was very brown and very well seasoned with herbs and probably quite a bit of butter.  The dish was served with a mix of lightly steamed vegetables and whipped mashed potatoes.  You really can't get any closer to comfort food than that.

I had a great experience that was due to the food and company!\n\nI reserved my table on OpenTable for 7:15 pm and arrived there for 7:05. I was seated right away all the way to the back of the restaurant. I arrived a little earlier than my friend and was waited on right away! The service is excellent! We had 2 waiters that waited on us throughout the night, so we were never waiting for our drink refill or any requests to be fulfilled. When my friend dropped her silverware on the floor, without even asking, the waiter brought her a new one within a couple of minutes! Talk about prompt service!! We hadn't even had the chance to ask for a new one. I guess he saw it and brought it right away! That's never happened at a restaurant before (well, not so quickly at least).\n\nWe started off with drinks. I ordered the Champagne au Peche and she ordered the St. Charles Streetcar, which was divine! I ordered two more of those streetcars that night! \n\nWhat we ordered:\n-P&J oysters. A must try!!!! I don't care for Drago's oysters much. My favorite oysters were from Borgne (another Besh restaurant), which are similar to these. However, now these are my favorite! The oysters aren't over cooked while the topping is perfectly cooked and crisp! SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! And trust me, I know my oysters. I can eat 2 dozen raw anyday (minimum). \n-Terrine of slow cooked foie gras with brioche and sea salt. This is a slice of foie gras and probably my favorite spread of the night. The brioche was great! Crispy yet soft. The perfect combination with the foie.\n-Assiette de Charcuterie. This was the charcuterie board that had the most variety. Along with the rabbit pate (which was divine), hogs head cheese, and something else that I had forgotten by now (I don't know if it's due to the wine or old age, haha), it also came with stone-ground mustard, house-made pickles,  and pickled watermelon (different and delicious!)\n\nI had a great experience here. Atmosphere was sometimes loud then sometimes a little quieter, but remained a constant energized and happy ambiance. There were tables of families, dates, friends, groups; variety of people.

That means she paid so I was even happier than usual to try a new place ;)\n\nFirst off it's a John Besh place so you know right away that you will be getting locally grown, raised, or caught food of the freshest variety.  We had a 6:30 reservation and were seated immediately.  We were seated in the back by the kitchen which was completely open to see into.  Kind of nice scene.  \n\nWe started off with drinks.  Her a glass of malbec and me with one of their own craft brews; a Luke-Alt.  Luke-Alt is an amber style beer crafted by Heiner Brau out of Covington.  They also have a blonde lager called the Luke-Fru.  Both are good but the Alt was fantastic.  We drank a round while munching on their fresh cut fries.  PERFECTION!!!  Crisp, greaseless and hot.  \n\nAfter this we order our entrees.  She had the shrimp and grits which from what I tasted were slightly spicy and really flavorfull.  I had a fried chicken special. It was a sweet and spicy chicken fried in tabasco and apricot flavors.  This was sitting on top of an okra and tomato etouffee.  So good!!!  \n\nThe portions were somewhat small for the price but perfect in the fact that I didn't want leftovers and I was full after.  The only drawback is that the legs of their chairs come down to a very small base.  If you lean back in them at all you are probably goign to fall.  I'm probably not suppose to talk about how my girlfriend fell over.  I'm definitely not suppose to talk about how I laughed so hard that I couldn't help her up.  She was fine other than slightly embarrassed.  Of course the embarrassment went away once a guy 3 tables over did the exact same thing. I think it was ok to laugh then.\n\nSo John invest in some new chairs my man.  Either that or release the blooper video of all the people falling who shouldn't lean over in their chairs.", "date": "2013-07-08 01:08:01"}

Despite the ample amount of empty tables (that remained empty the entire evening), we were told to wait by the hostesses for about 15 minutes until they decided to seat us. They brought us to a back dining room near the kitchen that was practically empty, and sat us at a tiny table in the corner.\n\nAnother ten minutes elapsed before our waiter came to introduce himself. We had the misfortune of being served by Kyle, who is hands down the most inept waiter we have ever encountered. He didn't know the menu whatsoever nor did he have any idea what the specials for the night were. When I asked for more information on the specialty beers, he couldn't answer - rather he turned the question back on to me, like I was supposed to provide the knowledge myself.\n\nWe started with the Baked P&J Oysters, which was the highlight (and only highlight) of the meal. They came piping hot, and were absolutely delicious.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Etoufee. Despite repeatedly asking Kyle if the entree was spicy (he assured us it wasn't), the dish arrived far too spicy for her to even eat. She was only able to manage a few bites before spending the next 15 minutes drinking water to cool her mouth down.\n\nI ordered the Steak and Frites. While the steak was cooked perfectly, it wasn't brought out hot. It came to the table lukewarm. Same deal with the fries. Lukewarm. Maybe now I see where the \"Luke\" in the name of the place comes from?\n\nWe were so disappointed with our experience that, after receiving the check, we asked to speak to a manager. Jennifer came over and we explained the situation. To her credit, she seemed genuinely concerned and asked what she could do to make things right. She offered to take care of something on the bill, or try to get us to come back another time to give us a better experience. We refused both, because A. we ate the food and B. we didn't want to waste another meal at L\u00fcke. \n\nIt seems like most people's experiences at Luke have differed from mine - which makes me wonder if I came on an off-night? Perhaps Kyle was new on the job? Perhaps the kitchen staff was slacking? I don't know. All I can say is that our experience was awful, and we'll never go back.", "date": "2013-07-08 16:52:38"}

But I'm sure they earned their vaca so C'est La Vie.\n\nAnother dude at the bar (we stayed and drank more) heard me tell mama \"no po boy\" and started offering a multitude of dining options. After a long list he stated that Luke was his favorite place. I let him know that we chose Emeril's over Luke for lunch that day and Luke was on our list for next time. I was wearing shorts, a golf shirt, and flip flops and didn't think I was dressed appropriately for Luke anyway. His response cracked me up. \"You are in New Orleans baby, so @#*^ing what.\" Off to LUKE.\n\nWe sat at the bar and watched the oyster shucker do his thing and even though July does not have an R in it we had a dozen sweet oysters on the half shell. They were delicious.\n\nMama ordered the burger. Good burger but my dish stole the show. Choucroute Garnie Maison smoked pork shank, Mangalitsa belly & bratwurst, house-made sauerkraut. Basically a beautifully roasted pork shank, a house made bratwurst sausage, a few pieces of pork belly, and some roasted potatoes over a bed of sauerkraut. An Iowa farm kids wet dream!!!!!! (see pics). The pork belly literally melted in your mouth and had a crazy good smoky bacon flavor to it, worth the $26 all by itself.\n\nTwo of the best meals of my life. I say two because no one could finish that dish. Stud waitress wrapped up the leftovers and put a French loaf and a mini jar of mustard in my go box. Breakfast the following morning was a pork shank sandwich with sauerkraut and mustard. WOW!\n\nEmeril's and Luke on the same day, I'm a lucky guy!", "date": "2013-07-09 19:06:13"}

It was about the same, so I ate it, but worried all night that those little shrimp where going to try and swim back up stream.

They were VERY generous with the amount of pate served for this $11 dish.  The little picked sides with it was delicious.  My friend who does not like pate tried and did enjoy this.\n\nMy friend had the Poulet grand-m\u00e8re (herb roasted local chicken, Allan Benton's bacon, farmers' market vegetables & whipped potatoes).  It was...good.  But not mind blowing.  Plate wasn't finished.\n\nI had the Choucroute garnie maison (smoked pork shank, Mangalitsa belly & bratwurst, house-made sauerkraut).  Ok so for $23, you're getting A LOT of food.  I was getting the stares from the table next to me as I'm a 4'11\" female served this MASSIVE pork dish.  But I gotta say, I was a bit let down.  The pork shank...which was HUGE was a bit dry.  And it tasted like a turkey leg at a fair.  You see it and oh man it looks juicy and it's so large but then you bit into it and it's...DRY.  I found myself eating more of the bratwurst only because it was less dry and tasted good with the sweet mustard.  Though I must say the bratswurst did not pack a good punch in the flavor department.  The pork belly was very delicious, however.  Melted in your mouth.\n\nAnd finally, the two stars is mostly the result of the sub par service we received.  First, our server totally looked like an ice queen B the whole time serving us.  Then we get the cold shoulder and see her go all \"is there anything else you need\" Ms. Suckity Up to the older, more well-off looking couple sitting next to us.  When we got our check I wanted to tell her there's two cards but they won't be split evenly but she just grabbed the check without asking.  When I was trying to get her attention she put up her finger to pause me and then talked to another waitress for about two minutes.\n\nSo two minority, young looking females.  Cold shoulder.

This place had pretty good ratings so we decided to give it a try. We were on a laid back vacation, we were all dressed quite casual.

Not found here, at our table at least. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and grits, which was said to be a favorite, and I was extremely disappointed. It was SO salty, I was only able to take a few bites and had to stop eating. I really regret not sending it back but the service made me feel uncomfortable. So I basically paid $26 for a couple bites of sodium enhanced grits. Taste aside, the portion was also saddening. You get a little scoop of grits covered in too much sauce. While taking our orders, the waiter asked us if we wanted soup or salad. Where I'm from, this signifies that it comes with the order. But not here. So each of us ordered a side and got charged $5 for it without even meaning to. \n\nAlmost everyone else at my table had ordered a burger, which they seemed to enjoy very much. It came with fries which also seemed to have endured a heavy hand on the salt. Their large burgers with fries were much cheaper than my tiny plate of shrimp and grits. \n\nSo to round it all up, my personal experience consisted of bad service and unsatisfying food.

Walking into the restaurant, I immediately noticed that the clientele was just as varied as the menu. The ambiance was rather relaxed and the dark wood paneling created a homey feel in a semi-upscale setting.\n\nI decided to try the express menu, which included a cup of soup and the entree of the day. On Saturday, it was slow cooked rabbit with grilled peppers, summer peas and tagliatelle. Although there was a lot going on in the dish including pesto that kinda appeared out of nowhere, it was simply delicious. The crab and corn bisque was a little salty, a little spicy and a little gritty, which was a little disappointing! Large pieces of sourdough bread accompanied the soup and entree. I finished the meal with the bread pudding but it was so sweet that it was nearly inedible. The hot buttered pecan sauce proved to be too much for even my serious sweet tooth. \n\nOverall, Luke was good but not as great as I'd anticipated. But, if you're looking for a great value, the express menu is definitely that.", "date": "2013-10-15 16:05:58"}

There were all sorts of people there which is always nice. The service was great!  Our waitress was attentive and gave great recommendations.  \n\nNow the food:\nThe fresh oysters were delicious.  I've never had them before and am still on the fence about it overall, but I'll admit they were pretty fresh tasting.  My parents loved it since my mom food orgasm-ed pretty loudly with every bite (pretty gross if you ask me).  I especially like that they had some sort of a wasabi sauce that went with it. \n\nI ordered the etouffee, which was good but it wasn't really anything to write home about.  My mom had the shrimp and grits, which I thought were fantastic but she thought was way too salty.  My dad had the express meal (Sunday was some veal dish with a cup of crab & corn soup).  The soup was really good, even though I'm not a huge fan of the red sauce base and this was kind of in between.  He said he like the veal dish but he will also eat anything and is a man of little to no words - so take that however you want.\n\nOverall, I liked the food and the ambiance of the place.  I was a little disappointed to see that for the price, the portions were tiny.  I know \"nicer\" restaurants always have smaller portions, but still, I guess I like having yummy leftovers.  I think I'd come back here but maybe try some of the other dishes and definitely to try those oysters.", "date": "2013-10-15 20:51:08"}

Service was so much better sitting at the bar. The drinks were stronger, service was a lot friendlier as well as efficient, and the bartenders were attractive, pleasant and worked hard.\n I wished i had sat at the bar the first 4 visits, that way I wouldn't have had to endure the same short haired, standoffish waitress and the mousey, wavy brown haired waiter. Both were very unwelcoming and weren't very apologetic when they would repeatedly forget parts of our order. The white coats that they wore were constantly dirty with very apparent stains. I noticed they never changed coats because I would be staring at the same stains the next day. The hostesses up front could use a bit of work as well. Gee, you are greeting paying customers, would it kill you to smile?\n\nWith all this aside, the oysters were cheap and fresh, drinks were cheap, and our last visit sitting at the bar makes my review 4 stars\n\n* the restaurant was about a 2 min walk from the Le Pavillon Hotel", "date": "2013-11-10 19:13:22"}

It's always sweltering hot in New Orleans. Wherever you go, you sweat. Every part of your body is moist - and not in the \"I just ate a deliciously moist cupcake\" kind of way. You're walking all over town. You're hungry, but you're not thinking about food. You're thinking about cooling off. You could go to the casino, or perhaps stop into a hotel lobby for a quick respite from the heat and humidity. But if you really want to cool off - if you really want to turn your body's moistness into a chilly frost and bring your temperature down to almost absolute zero - stop into L\u00fcke.\n\nL\u00fcke restaurant is, without a doubt, the coldest restaurant on Earth, and perhaps beyond. If you sit directly beneath the cooling vent like my wife and I did - both times we visited, no less - you could probably die.  Or, if you're like me, you'll absolutely love it. I'm a polar bear and find myself in my natural habitat when I am here. Thank you, thank you, John Besh. Thank you, L\u00fcke. Thank you for being a freezing cold oasis in an otherwise deathly urban desert.\n\nNow onto the food...\n\nAs I mentioned before, my wife and I came here twice. That is, two times, during a 4-day vacation. In a place like New Orleans where there is SO MUCH good food everywhere you look, it is almost sacrilege to eat in the same place twice in one trip. (Good thing it was so hot out.)\n\nThe first time we came in for breakfast, and it was awesome. I had the classic southern staple: a fried chicken biscuit with a spicy mayhaw glaze. I have no idea what the hell mayhaw is, but it was so yummy and decadent, I felt like I needed to be spanked afterward. My wife had the egg white frittata, complete with burrata cheese and Covey Rise vegetables. (Whatever that means.) For a healthy dish, it looked absolutely delicious. She loved it. \n\nOf course, breakfast in New Orleans would not be complete without the obligatory basket of powdered beignets.  You can get them with chocolate dipping sauce or a fresh berry jam. We opted for the blueberry jam. Absolutely amazing. \n\nL\u00fcke also makes a mean Bloody Mary - almost a little too mean for my taste. It's not that I mind the spiciness.  In fact, I love that. But the L\u00fcke Bloody Mary is just so crimson red and flavorfully intense, with an eerie viscosity that reminds me a little too much of actual blood. Still, try one. Just one gave me a buzz that lasted all morning long.\n\nThe second time we came for brunch. No chicken biscuit on this menu, but lots of other options. I was so hungover during this meal that as I am drafting this review on a plane with no Internet, I can't even remember off the top of my head what the hell me or my wife ordered, but I do remember it being really good. (For more on my hangover, see my review for the Clover Caf\u00e9.)\n\nUPDATE: Having cheated and looked back at the menu, I can now recall our bizarre order: the heirloom tomato salad, Mimi's buttermilk pancakes with the honey-pecan butter, and an order of the house fries. We just shared it all, and no evidence remained once we were done. Yeah, everything is that good.\n\nAll in all I would give L\u00fcke a solid 4.5 stars. But since Yelp doesn't allow half-star ratings, I'm more than happy to give L\u00fcke a 5.  Service was very friendly both times, though they do get busy and it may be a little difficult to get your check. But at least they don't try to rush you out and turn your table. I really hate that. (For more on how much I hate that, see my review for Emeril's.)\n\nBottom line: Don't skip L\u00fcke if you come to New Orleans.", "date": "2013-11-12 04:28:00"}

My server recommended the crab bisque and that is what I ordered. I was seated in a corner seat with the view of the kitchen which was quite interesting. They were very good at getting the orders out quickly. I think the Friday special was a favorite as I practically saw one at every table. They brought out warm bread with butter first and then came the bisque. Needless to say, I quickly put my phone down and started savoring the soup as the aroma was very appetizing. This soup was divine. I didn't leave a drop of soup behind and the crab meat in it was perfectly sweet. Then, a few minutes later came out the \"Court-bouillon\" with redfish, crab, shrimp, oysters and Louisiana popcorn rice. I would say this was one of the best seafood dish I have ever tasted.

Upon arrival, it was paltry - at best - with the exception of one kind gentleman waiter who seemed to get it and really care.  \n\nWe started with 2 dozen raw oysters - that seemed to be shucked an hour earlier and left on a cooling rack.  Needless to say, it would have been nice to have freshly shucked and cocktail sauce of better quality than Sysco ketchup.\n\nI chose the Reveillon.  The 1st course - I opted for the boudin.  It was not nearly as good as other local options like Cochon or Toup's Meatery, but sadly it was the best thing brought to the table in the four courses.  \n\nFor the 2nd Course, I ordered turtle soup.  Let me preface that I am a Cajun and eat just about anything; and rarely, if ever, send anything back.  Tonight, I sent the turtle soup back.  After being blown away two nights prior at R'evolution, this seemed like canned soup with three or four small pieces of turtle meat.  (quail, duck or deviled eggs or sherry were not involved or offered).\n\nFor the main course, the Flounder with crabmeat and spinach topped with what may as well been Velveeta was overdone, salty and quite small. In fairness, the spinach was nice. \n\nAlthough others had to wait longer for drinks than I did, the Tin Roof on tap was delightful.  \n\nAfter having enough of the sub par food and long waits, we opted to take the desert home; but that took time too. \n\nI offer this to fellow locals and travelers visiting New Orleans.  I appreciate sharing and receiving good, objective information - especially about food; and I want others to have the best meals possible - regardless of the price point - while in New Orleans.  \n\nChristmas festivities turned into a Last Supper for Luke.\n\nHappy Holidays!", "date": "2013-12-19 03:38:47"}

So I'll try to be delicate and say this the right way...\n\nJohn, you need to spend less time in front of the camera and more time in your restaurant. \n\nStaying in the Hilton for a week netted me many opportunities to dine here. I experienced two brunches, a few happy hours and many just-before-closing cocktails. Each time was a different experience but the bad easily outweighed the good. \n\nBoth of our breakfasts here were terribly disappointing. For breakfast one I sampled the \"Eggs in a Jar\" which, for $22, is not really that great. It consists of 5 shrimp stuffed into a jar with jalape\u00f1o cheese grits and eggs. Yup, eggs, shrimp, cheese and grits for $22. Oh, I forgot the jar. But you don't get to keep the jar. The dish was actually ordered by a table-mate and when it first came out, the eggs were not just undercooked, they were not cooked at all. My Korean friend who eats the snottiest eggs I've seen anyone eat had to send it back. My \"Healthy Start\", which was house-made granola and fruit on yogurt was sparse at best. The granola was sticky and chewy, not crunchy at all, and while the yogurt was delicious, it wasn't good enough to salvage my image of this $12 dish. I'll say this, the coffee was good. At $6 for a double espresso, it better be. Oh, and the beignets were proper, even though they sent out the wrong sauce with them. \n\nOur second breakfast here allowed me to sample one of the $14 biscuit sandwiches - the sausage, egg and cheese biscuit served with a cup of fruit. My North Carolina friends make better biscuits in Portland, and load them up with all sorts of meats, gravies, eggs and what-not for half the price. The biscuit here has decent flake and is fairly buttery, but it didn't stand up to the small sausage patty and cheese. One word comes to mind when I think about what I paid for this dish - ludicrous. One member of my table ordered the home fries and when they came with meat in them (no mention of meat on the menu), she sent them back and said \"I actually am fine without these\". Instead of just taking them off the bill, they sent back potatoes minus the meat. \"But we don't want these\" we said. \"Oh you'll like them, trust me.\" she said as she walked off... and left them on the bill.  \n\nDespite two food issues with each of our meals (not cheap meals mind you) no apologies, comps, or any other customer service was offered either time. How much balls does it take to not even verbally apologize for such an expensive dish sent out totally wrong? Especially since we're pretty nice in our response/request to have them re-done?\n\nMy bar experiences here were quite opposite to my meal experiences. Any time I could find a seat at the bar and order a drink, it was decent, and priced well. The whiskey list is short but there's some good stuff on there. The bartenders are friendly. The $.50 oysters and half-priced drinks at HHour are an insane deal. \n\nSo it makes me wonder. Why go to lengths to offer such an amazing deal at HHour and good service at the bar, and then offer poor service and bad value for those wiling to sit down and spend more for a meal? Who knows. \n\nWhile I think this is a mighty fine hotel bar, as a restaurant it fails on value, on service, and frankly on quality of food. Had I been faced with half the prices, I might find this fare to be passable, but at the sky-high menu prices, I'd expect much, much more. \n\nI'm sure John Besh (if he ever reads these - probably not) doesn't expect his restaurant to be run this way. But c'mon. You send out completely see-through, uncooked eggs in a $22 egg dish and offer not even a verbal apology when the food is returned, let alone any other customer service on a $100 brunch for 4 people (no cocktails ordered)?! Yikes. \n\nWe wouldn't have returned for an actual meal after the first visit for breakfast but had to grab grub on our last day on the way to the airport. Can't say I'd come back outside of happy hour. Maybe dinner is better? At least the bartenders are nice.", "date": "2014-01-14 20:20:28"}

Never knowing who our waiter was resulted in poor service, bread was never brought until we noticed other tables had it and we requested ours. Now down to the food, sooooo underwhelming. We started with the Flamencuche, which they were praised for based on the framed news article when you entered the restaurant. It was compared in the news article to a good pizza, it was terrible, thin flat bread was overwhelmed with an insane amount of onions, its all I could taste. For our meal ordered the burgers, because all the reviews praised Luke's for this. Once again so much carmalized onions and bacon, it made it hard to taste the meat. This place simply was overpriced and under-delivered. Even on their sodas, 3.25 for a small glass bottle soda, ridiculous. So disappointed, didn't even care to see the dessert menu. Mr Besh, I was not impressed would never return.", "date": "2014-01-22 04:17:38"}

My wife had gotten a Lonely Planet guide book prior to the trip (and they usually steer us the right way) but it had NO mention of Luke.   \n\nSo on our last night in town we decided to give it a try.   I made a reservation online and when we arrived the restaurant was very busy, but they seated us right away.   We were taken through the dining room, through a set of doors and up into another dining area that overlooked the kitchen, providing a cool view of the chefs at work.   \n\nWe started with two glasses of champagne, which immediately led the nice waitress to inquire if this was a special occasion but we were just celebrating our last meal in town with a glass of bubbly.    We were continually tag teamed by her and another young lady all night, both taking great care of us.   \n\nWe had gotten the charbroiled oysters at Drago's and loved them so we decided to try the P&J Oysters as an appetizer.    Hmm.....how to describe other than so so good and wished we had 3 orders of them.   I could have picked the shell up and cleaned every drop with my teeth if given the chance :-)   \n\nAnother nice thing is that for wine drinkers you have not only a variety of wine to choose from, but you can get bottles, carafes, 3/4 carafes, 1/2 carafes, or glasses.   \n\nFor entrees, my wife got the shrimp and grits and I got \u00e9touff\u00e9e.   I must say that hers blew mine away, first of all the grits.....soooo creamy from the mascarpone cheese that they put in it, I decided I am ONLY going to make my grits that way from now on.   And the shrimp, were so perfectly cooked, it is hard to describe.  Not spongy or gummy like some places who use frozen shrimp or overcook them, these were cooked perfect.

This is when  I found L\u00fcke, located inside the Hilton on St. Charles Avenue.  John Besh, who is the chef behind Domenica and Soda Shop in New Orleans, is the culinary brainchild behind L\u00fcke.\n\nMy first meal here was for dinner, where me and family started with the Boudin Louisianne (9.5), which was boudin served with cracklins and spicy cabbage.  I had never had boudin before in my life until then, so I have nothing to gauge its authenticity.  All I can say is, I enjoyed it!  The spicy cabbage lacked a bit of flavor except for the spiciness, but the it did compliment the boudin.  The boudin is definitely a dish to be split between several people, as it can get a bit heavy, but the cracklins really were a plus!\n\nWe also got the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"en cocotte\" (22), which was roasted jalapeno cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages all in a cast-iron skillet.  The jalapeno cheese grits ended up being my favorite part of any dish that night!  The jalapeno was just enough to flavor the melted, slightly burnt cheese on top of the grits.  And I didn't think I liked grits before this - but beware, it's oily!  The andouille sausage was also good, but unfortunately, the shrimp didn't taste very fresh.\n\nWe also had the Seafood Gumbo a la Creole (8), which was tasty, but in my opinion, not all that unforgettable for one reason or another.  It wasn't the spectacular gumbo I was hoping it would be, but it was still flavorful, though a little too salty for my taste.\n\nedit//\nI was told by one of the friendly staff that they have a happy hour with 50 cent oysters and half off drinks, so sure enough, I returned with a couple of friends.  The bar is quite the wait (reservations are recommended), but it's totally worth it!  The oysters are ginormous, they're fresh, and cleaned out well by the extremely friendly guys behind the counter.  I had the St. Charles Streetcar, which was nice and refreshing.  The Riverbend was also refreshing, but a bit sweeter and fruitier.

Years after my first review, the oysters here are still out of this world. Fresh, plump, and local.  The same guy is there shucking oysters that I remember from my first visit, and happy hour still includes $.50cent oysters and half-priced cocktails from 3-6pm. \n\nMy cousin came to visit, so her stay had to include an homage to Besh (my chef crush). Alas, no Besh sightings this time, but stellar meal and service all the same. We walked in with a reservation, were immediately seated, and quickly two servers joined us to take our drink orders, water preferences, and recommend starters. \n\nWe started with the baked P&J oysters that came out piping hot, along with crispy pork belly with roasted Brussels sprouts and beets. Savory, herbaceous, briney, and delectable. We immediately wished we'd ordered more oysters. \n\nFor cocktails, we both had the New Orleans streetcar - pear vodka, St. Germain and a little lemon. Light, but still with a kick. \n\nMy cousin ordered the shrimp and grits, while I ordered the moules et frites. Big, sweet Gulf shrimp in savory sauces over creamy grits. Ginormous portions of mussels with a light, garlicky wine broth and perfect, salty frites that we couldn't stop eating. \n\nNow, THAT was a meal.  See pics.", "date": "2014-02-21 14:00:17"}

We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.\n\nWe also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).\n\nTHE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.", "date": "2014-02-24 03:58:18"}

We were treated to a glass of champagne and the manager stopped by to congratulate us.\n\nBeing a huge fan of Chef Besh, I simply asked the waiter to suggest to me whatever the Chef's favorite meals are and he suggested the P&J oysters to start and the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte.\" \n\nThe oysters were amazing. Talk about a burst of flavor in your mouth. The En Cocotte was epic. It was so tasty that we were actively trying to figure out when we will next come to the restaurant and if we can find ways to fly down just for the food.\n\nThe only snag was that one meal did not make it out with the others.  The manager came over to apologize in person and as an apology treated us to another round of champagne.\n\nWe all cleared our plates and were too stuffed for dessert but the team brought out little Besh Box truffle samplers which hit the spot.  These truffles could easily compete against some major French pastry and chocolate shops in Paris.\n\nThe only thing that could have made the experience better was if I could meet Chef Besh and personally thank him for the amazing meals and for being an inspiration to those of us who share the same philosophy about food and cooking, buy local and cook with love.

This was probably one of the best seats in the house, because we got a chance to look at all of the good stuff coming out. So when the waitress mentioned that eggs in a jar were one of their most popular options, i believed her (I saw three of them come out while we were deciding what to get). \n\nLook, I understand it's one of the more important things on the menu, but if someone in your party gets this, and it's not you, you're going to be jealous. You are. So just order it. \n\nThe shrimp is battered and then fried, and arranged around the rim of this jar.

It didn't matter though, they managed to fit us in with no wait. \n\nThe first time we came for a late brunch. Two of my friends got the Luke burger and I split the local crab omelette with a friend. She and I both got a cup of crab bisque to start. The crab bisque was amazing, so creamy and hot and not at all fishy. It was one of the best crab bisques I've ever had, and I make it a point to try them all. My omelette was good but a tad bit greasy. The crab in it was very fresh and they put a generous amount of it. The salad that came with the omelette had a fresh, great tasting vinaigrette. We also got fries that were ridiculously delicious! I couldn't stop eating the fries, even after I was stuffed. The guys that got the burgers loved it. They said it was simple but well-done and very filling. \n\nThe next day we went at 3pm for happy hour. The oysters were so good and so cheap! Ditto with drinks. I see why it gets so crowded during happy hour. The only negative part of the oysters was that they were a bit gritty and the shell part was muddier than usual. But that wasn't a big deal. They were fresh and big. My non-oyster-eating friends got the \"cochon de lait\" sandwiches and again, they loved it. \n\nAs for the service: the waitstaff here is on point. They're obviously career servers. Luke has great service, even when it's busy. \n\nAll I can say is, GO. The food was amazing and I can't wait to come back.

I was also a little in disbelief considering I saw a at least 4 open tables in plain view.  I thought to myself...ok maybe this place really IS that busy with reservations.   My group decided we'd still wait since we had already walked there and weren't familiar with the area.  Then literally 5 minutes later, we were called by a different host and ushered to a back room.  In that back room entitled \"casual dining\" there were probably another 4-5 open tables.  I really don't know what that hostess was talking about in the first place.  Whatever, we overlooked that and went straight in to looking at the dinner menu.  To my disappointment, the two \"$$\" was not really representative of the dinner menu.  Entrees were easily $21-$30+ and to me, that's not equivalent to $$.  It's more of $$$.  But since it was a John Besh restaurant...we wanted to go all out.  We ordered the PJ baked oysters, a dozen raw gulf oysters, shrimps and grits, and etoufee.  I have to admit, the raw gulf oysters were the most delicious oysters I've ever eaten.  Very sweet and did not taste like the sea.  The PJ baked oysters were equally to die for.  Very flavorful and came out piping hot.  Those were definitely the highlights of the meal.  I really enjoyed the etoufee too, especialy the sausage in them.  Service was great throughout our meal and our cups of water were never left empty.  Overall, the food and service during our meal was great and I liked how we could see the cooks preparing our food (could be a good and bad thing...since a few of them didn't look too happy and weren't entirely too refined while cooking).

My wife had the entrec\u00f4te (ribeye) and I had the canard roti. Unfortunately the duck wasn't very palatable and was over seasoned and the skin was rubbery. The ribeye was adequate but nothing special. I sadly can not recommend this place.", "date": "2014-03-29 04:12:40"}

I am in the hospitality business and I forgive a LOT of bad service but this server was clearly having a bad day. She had 3 tables and she was so short. When I asked about the fish of the day, it was a short - \"it's a white fish\". Ok... The two gentlemen next to us waited over 25 minutes for oysters and had to flag down the ancillary server again to find out where they were. Everyone has a bad day but her short and almost rude service ruined the experience for me. We didn't get dessert because we were disgusted by the service.

The hostess assured me that the whole menu was served at the bar, so I ponied up & ordered the swordfish & kale & a glass of French chard. Both were beautiful & complimented each other perfectly. Definitely some of the best swordfish I've had. If only there had been just a touch more kale!\n\nThe bar tender was friendly & attentive, & I had great service.

Nice.  It's lively at Luke, the music for rhythm junkies.  I was at home.   I like the wood panels too.  It's a place i would want to have a few draft beers,  Kir Royale and seafood.  Walked in early around happy hour and we took advantage of the oysters special. At 1268 reviews and counting, this place is deelish. First,  I had a dozen. Sounds like a lot but there were mongers eating 2 dozen at a time.  The raw oysters were cold, the liquor crisp, clean tasting with a slight briny edge that confirmed they are fresh and shucked seconds ago.  \n\nThen the shrimp and grits arrived. The description mentioned, jumbo shrimp and grits.  I wanted to try this dish here because it's been hailed as one of the best plates to try.  I sampled the grits, bold cheesy slightly rich yet simply put together, nice.  I got into the shrimp -- they were not jumbo, unless jumbo in gulf waters is medium sized in my book.  I found the shrimp to be fresh meaty good.  Then a powerful Cajun salty attack took over my palate.  I don't mind spice as I appreciate Cajun food but the salt was many dimensions above salty.  I sent it back.  I picked more oysters this time, since we seemed to have more luck with them.  There was a wait for fresh oysters at this time and we were treated to fried oysters on the house--  delicious,crunchy with a nice sauce for dipping.   That was very nice of them to do that.  In the meantime, my second course, the roasted beets salad with spinach and crunchy spiced/toasted pistachios came.  It was a bit oily, the golden beets were fresh and delicious, slightly to the tooth.   I  was OK with the dish until I crunched into one of the spiced pistachios and that too, was super salty. I couldn't help but think that the cooks at this restaurant smoke heavily as this is what I've experienced in cities like Paris or Rome, where smoking is common and chefs who smoke  are a bit heavy on the Na-CL.  Less 2 stars for the overwhelmingly salty food.\n\nWas only able to take one foto too much fun drinking with friends over wine and cocktails. It was really fun here that I forgot about the food.  But, a reminder to Mr. Besh, please test your food.  \n\nTip:  As mentioned the oysters during happy hour at half price are freshly shucked scrummy.   I had 2 dozen at 50c a piece\n\nVisits: 1", "date": "2014-04-23 23:00:27"}

This is Besh's homage to the brasseries that once dominated New Orleans.

For a bisque it is somewhat light and doesn't coat your palate with heavy cream.\n\nMimi's Buttermilk Pancakes are light and fluffy.  Topped with a honey-pecan butter, this transforms it into true Southern comfort food.  The fruit cane syrup is a little too sweet for my taste, but eaten with moderation makes this a winning dish.\n\nThe Louisiana Shrimp and Grits is a revelation.  The shrimp are perfectly cooked, and the grits are nice and creamy.  The sauce is made with shrimp stock and Andouille sausage.  For a traditionally heavy dish, the shrimp stock base seemed to lighten the dish up.\n\nThe Bread Pudding tastes like a combination of French toast and cr\u00e8me brulee, but without the usual bourbon sauce.  Although good, a little kick of booze would have put it over the top.\n\nSee blog for pics.", "date": "2014-04-28 01:50:57"}

We sampled things from the entire brunch menu and everything was quite yummy.

How irresponsible of me, in New Orleans, on a bachelor party, to drink that much the night before. I say this not to sound cool because I party (still, I mean, guilty), but because my meal at L\u00fcke (don't forget the umlaut!) was a truly amazing breakfast and I'd like to attribute that to the restaurant and not my then-state of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\nNow, when you first see the menu, it's a bit overwhelming (again, let's assume this is not a side effect of drinking), and maybe even a bit expensive. But rest assured, it is money well spent - you will certainly taste the high-quality products they put in their dishes here.\n\nI went with the seemingly straight-forward Southern Breakfast, soon realizing it was more of a Choose Your Own Adventure-type deal once the waiter started rattling off a series of this-or-that questions to me. Ultimately, I went with two (organic) sunny side-up eggs, some dude named Allan Benton's bacon (apparently, he's a big deal in the bacon world), a biscuit, and hash browns. That last item I honestly didn't see listed anywhere, not even as a side, but if I were you, I'd inquire about 'em, because they were the absolute highlight of my meal. The real surprise was that these taters came tossed with big chunks of super savory, tremendously tasty, thick-cut bacon. Of course, this kind of negated my Allan Benton's bacon pick. Therefore, fair warning, if you get the hash browns, choose the Chisesi ham (yes, L\u00fcke likes to name-drop) or cane syrup sausage, if you want to try a different meat. Otherwise, hey, double bacon. Which is never a bad thing.\n\nEither seeing how banged up our group of bros was on a Saturday morning and just figuring we were on a bachelor party weekend (correct, as we later confirmed with them), or L\u00fcke has the most generous staff in New Orleans (could honestly be both of these things), we were brought over two bottles of champagne on the house to help us celebrate. We certainly weren't ordering extravagantly enough to deserve them, nor did our bodies particularly need 'em (please, we still drank up), but man, was that just a super nice gesture, much appreciated.\n\nI will say though* that the strange layout of the restaurant was something I just couldn't get over during my meal. Typically I can ignore these things, especially when a meal is this good. But anyway, we were led to L\u00fcke's back half, which was weirdly across a hotel hallway. It had the kitchen on display in what looked like a glass interrogation booth. And it also lacked the high ceilings and open feel of the front of the house, which came off as stately and very gastropub-y. This back room didn't come off as much of anything, and honestly just seemed like an afterthought, a place to put more patrons.\n\nStill, strange second rooms won't deter me from making a repeat visit next time I'm in town. I'll just ask to be sat in the front half. And for more hash browns with bacon, please. And maybe some Aleve. Thanks.\n\n*This means I'm about to sound like a dick right after the complimentary champagne comment, no matter how hard I try not to.", "date": "2014-05-10 11:24:59"}

We visit New Orleans once a year for the past several years and just added this to our must visit list for when we are in town (along with Willie Mae, Mothers and Cafe du Monde, and Big Fisherman). \n\nWe came here for a second dinner (around 9:45 PM so no wait) during one of our food conquests. The 5 of us ordered family style so we can try a little bit of everything. Our orders were delish, good quality and good taste. Everything on the dish made sense and the flavors complimented each other (not like this other place we went to during our food conquest).\n\nTerrine Of Slow Cooked Foie Gras - Frois gras patte. I've had some in the past that didn't fare so well. Not the same as frois gras saut\u00e9ed, but done well. I'd order this again. \n\nCrawfish Bisque - Utter creamy goodness for crawfish lovers. You really taste the crawfish. \n\nSalad Luke- Liked the salad. Get a lil of everything on one fork and it's a nice fresh bite. Creamy, sweet and sour. One negative, it was too overdressed. Maybe because it was late, the kitchen person had a heavy hand. Would still get again and ask for less dressing. \n\nEntrec\u00f4te Grill\u00e9e Et Frites- Rib eye steak with fancy butter done right. All 5 of us hands down LOVED this dish. \n\nFresh gulf fish of the day was sheepshead fish battered. - At the end of the trip we didn't want anymore fried food, but this dish was okay. It was gone by the end of the evening even though we were full. \n\nPoulet Grand-m\u00e8re - Normally I do not like chicken. It's usually white meat and dry. However, this is a half chicken (bones and all) and makes it to my top chicken meals. The chicken was moist, flavorful, and went so well with Allen Benton's bacon and the mixed veggies. One small downside is the mash was on the salty side, but we'd order this again. Another 5/5 at the table.\n\nBrendan's Bread Pudding- The only other place I've had this better was at a top US steakhouse. Very good. \n\nSteamed Chocolate - Gone in 1 minute. \n\nBourbon Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Also good. \n\nAll in all, 5 out of 5 of us liked Lukes. The service was excellent (waitress even gave up a list of places to visit for our trip next year) and the prices were very reasonable for an upper scale type place. A great southern/French restaurant to visit during your trip to the big easy.", "date": "2014-05-11 23:16:51"}

We were quickly seated and our server came to us about 5 mins later. He gave us the menu and went over the specials for the day. Everything seem good, but once our order came out we never saw him again. He didn't come out to fill our glasses or check on us instead he was waiting on other tables. We finished our meal and had to wave him down several times for the check. Well guess what? Almost 30 mins later he never came back with the check so we had to ask someone else for it. Sorry for the rant about the service, but it wasn't something I expected from a John Besh establishment. \n\nAbout the food. This was our second John Besh restaurant on this trip and I've to say I wasn't overly impressed with either. I ordered the shrimp and grits that came out in a little pan, raw oysters and P&J baked oysters. The oysters were pretty good so we had to order another dozen.

Crawfish bisque, chilled jumbo gulf shrimp, shrimp and grits, and the shrimp garganelli.  I enjoyed every bite and also LOVED the French 75 cocktail. The food portion was unfortunately small. \n\nLunch for 2 came up to about 100 (pre-tip).  May be more if you have a large appetite or come here for dinner. \n\nAnyway, I wish the service could be better for a restaurant of this caliber so that it's worthy of the food served.", "date": "2014-05-27 20:27:32"}

Even when I lived here, the Besh restaurants topped my restaurant charts. With my girlfriend visiting the Big Easy for the first time, having never tasted gumbo or had crawfish, L\u00fcke was the choice. \n\nWe sat down to a table in the front half of the restaurant (the back was closed for the night), but our hostess offered to let us see a view of the kitchen before we sat down. Through gigantic panes of glass, you can see the kitchen army set about their mission. One day it would be lovely to sit in the back and watch them as we eat. As we sat down, I mentioned to our waitress, Shawn, that we were celebrating a special occasion.  What happened next, I am still unclear. She was motioned away by her manager, Jeff, and the rest became a meal for the ages.\n\nShe returned with two complimentary glasses of champagne, which they refilled for the rest of the night. We decided that we'd sample both a cup of the bisque and gumbo. For me, the gumbo is exactly what a seafood gumbo should be, a dark not burnt roux, large gulf oysters and shrimp, spicy deja but ready for a dash of tobasco if that's your preference. The crawfish bisque was creamy without being overpowering. It is rich and fragrant, with the final touch being a stuffed crab head sitting right in the middle of the bowl. \n\nShawn returned soon with fried frog legs on the house. I've been having frog legs in many different forms since I was a youngster, but these tempura fried legs were deboned, making them easily cuttable with a fork, with a contrast in sauces with a lemon aioli on top and a green chimichurri on the bottom. Perfectly cooked.\n\nWith all the rich food, we decided to split the down home delicacy shrimp and grits, and these were the perfect example. Dark roux, grits and perfectly cooked shrimp prawns. They even split ours into separate cast iron skillets. \n\nLastly, they delivered us the only thing we could possibly have eaten- a light and fluffy play on a strawyberry shortcake using strawberries, whipped cream, and the lightest cookies I've ever eaten complete with a birthday candle. The strawberries and cream and  cookies almost melted in your mouth as you put them to your lips. Perfect compliment to our bubbly.\n\nWe were in awe of the magic of the evening, the warmth of the people- specifically, Vusi the backwaiter, Shawn, our entertaining and funny server, and Jeff, the manager who stopped by to make sure we enjoyed everything. I couldn't have been more proud of Louisiana showing my girlfriend true southern hospitality. \n\nAll in all, the evening could be summed up in one little exchange as they poured us another glass of champagne:\n\nHer: What is happening here? \nMe: It's New Orleans....\n\nThat about says it all.", "date": "2014-06-12 18:23:12"}

And what you get for messing up your internal clock for eating? 50 cents oysters.  I had $1 oyster happy hours before but never 50 cents.

If you like thinner style oysters, these might not be for you.\n\nAnd if you want it cooked instead of raw, they have the same thing for $6 for half a dozen fried ones.  I didn't have any of those because I ordered 2 dozen raw oysters for just myself.

They also have half priced drinks during happy hours too but why would you care about that right?\n\nOf course I couldn't just live on raw oysters alone so I started with a small cup of gumbo and because so many mentioned it, I fought internally between their famous burger and what some said was the best Shrimp and Grits around the area. The Shrimp and Grits won out just because it was more of a local food where a burger, no matter how good, is everywhere.\n\nI would pass on the gumbo. 3 stars. Good but there are better around the French Quarters.\n\nThe Shrimp and Grits was amazing. The Shrimp was tender. The grits was buttery smooth. There is a nice slightly charred cheesy shell on top of the sauce which I didn't get at the other place. I would say this is my second favorite Shrimp and Grits so far. Just be aware this one is with a slight french twist as per the kind of higher end restaurant that it was so it's less traditional but not far off. 4.5 stars\n\nThe staff was amazingly attentive and friendly.

There could have been more grits and it would have been more satisfying. The bread pudding was the best I've had at a restaurant. The sauce was great and it came with vanilla bean ice cream on top! Best part of the meal! If the portions were bigger, I would def give Luke 4-4.5 stars!", "date": "2014-06-16 20:29:42"}

My friend said she didn't like grits but Jamaal said she would like these, he was right she loved the creamy grits and the eggs were cooked to perfection. Another friend had the eggs in a jar, grits with a poached egg and shrimp wonderful presentation and even better flavors deep in the mason jar. My other friend had their matzo ball soup (best we have ever had even in a Jewish Deli) and the frogs legs, crispy and delicious. Even our picky eating friend loved the frog legs. Now for my dish..... I am still dreaming of those flavors. I had the shrimp and grits. Roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits topped with andouille sausage grave packed with sausage then topped with jumbo shrimp. I wanted to lick the plate clean it was the most wonderful dish eaten in New Orleans.\n\nWe wen back again for happy hour, don't miss it! The oysters were amazing we had them raw and fried.

We had the flamenkuche for an appetizer. It's a flat bread with caramelized onions, cheese, and the most flavorful, smoky bacon. The fennel seeds really cinch the dish. We then had crab and corn bisque, which had a nice kick of red pepper at the finish, and the beet salad, which is better than it sounds. It's beets, a mix of greens, blue cheese, and spicy pistachios. The only criticism I could offer is that the beets would be more appealing if julienned instead of sliced. For the main, we had the shrimp en cocotte, and that's definitely the dish to get your first time. [Side note: I've had a burger before, too, and it's one of the most under-rated in town. The price is high, but the meat mix is perfect and the result is great.] For sides, we added the roasted vegetables and, of course, the frites. You really can't go there and not have the frites.

I was in town for a bachelorette party, and we decided to come here for a nice dinner together. When we walked in, we were greeted enthusiastically and seated right away. Since the staff recognized that we were here on a special occasion, the manager personally brought out a round of champagne on the house, congratulating the bride on her upcoming wedding. Amazing hospitality right from the start!\n\nThe way our reservation time worked out, we got to enjoy the last fifteen minutes of happy hour: fifty cent oysters and half price drinks. Many of the ladies ordered multiple drinks at once to last through the rest of the evening, which the waiter had no problem with. The oysters were ice-cold and fresh, served with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and lemon wedges. The texture was velvety soft, with a wonderfully tangy taste with little to no brine. I usually dislike seafood because of that salty sea taste, but these were cleaned very well. The other ladies were also very happy with their drinks, notable ones included the Riverbend and St. Charles Streetcar. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits after seeing all of the stellar reviews. It definitely lives up to the hype. The plump shrimp was paired well with the sauce made from Andouille and green onion sausages, and the jalape\u00f1o cheese grits were amazing. The cheese makes the grits more savory, and you get that flavorful kick from the jalape\u00f1os. A bite of that with a piece of juicy shrimp on top is divine. The dish is quite rich and a little on the salty side, so make sure you have a full glass of water ready. While the plate may look small when you get it, it is quite filling. \n\nWe finished off with dessert, and this was what made this meal one of the best I've had. Usually one of three courses of a meal end up being subpar, but the bread pudding was the best bread pudding I've ever had. Coming from the south, I've had a fair share too. Brendan's Bread Pudding is exceptional. The bread is fluffy and soft, giving it an airy texture that doesn't just taste like a sweetened, compacted piece of dense bread. Instead, it's more like a cake in airiness and soaked in the delicious hot buttered pecan sauce. This creates the great flavor of this dessert, with caramelized nutty notes, as well as what tastes like toffee. The vanilla ice cream on top keeps things from getting too sweet and mellows out the pecan topping from being too overpowering. \n\nWhen we were ready for our bill, we asked the waiter if we could split the bride's check evenly amongst our own split checks. After waiting for twenty minutes, the waiter came by to tell us that the computer was having issues and wasn't splitting the bride's check the way we wanted it to. So in order to apologize for our wait, he comped the bride's meal entirely so that the computer would be able to split our checks and pay separately. This was a sweet gesture that they insisted upon, and we really appreciated their effort to make things right. \n\nL\u00fcke is fabulous, and I would definitely come here again and recommend it to everyone I know in the area! Quality food, quality service!", "date": "2014-08-15 21:42:18"}

My Eggs in Jar was probably the cutest meal ever, served with soft eggs, grits, and about a half dozen shrimp sitting on the rim of the jar. I was so full after eating about half of this that Rusty had to finish it for me. His omelet was full of big lumps of crab meat, it was very tasty. The Shrimp & Grits, which had a much more \"cajun\" taste than my meal was also very good. I'd recommend any of these, but the shrimp dishes were definitely my favorite. \n\nThe oysters were so good, that we ended up ordering another round. We also tried the the bread pudding which was so so good. Don't forget to dip it in the caramel sauce served on the plate.

I arrived in NoLa Wednesday and am leaving Sunday.  I have eaten my way through most of the city and this is to be my last stop on the gluttony train.  \n\nMy wife is a big John Besh fan so this was a very exciting finale for her.  \n\nThe outside of this restaurant is nothing special.  You could walk right by and not even notice it.  As soon as you walk though the door, however, things change.  \n\nIt is lively!  Great music, warm wood finishes, cool old school tile floor and a kick ass \nraw bar!  It was piled high with mountains of ice, covered by shellfish.  You could belly right up and start your seafood adventure.  We were a party of four so sadly we opted for a table.  I do NEED to sit at that bar next time.  \n\nWe at least sat NEXT to the raw bar.  I immediately ordered a mint julep (after the ladies ordered obviously).  It was served very traditionally and it was delicious.  Everyone at the table ordered different drinks off of the cocktail menu and they were all good.  \n\nFor starts I went with the liver Pate'.  It was extraordinary.  I am not using that word lightly.  I love pate' and order it almost every time it is offered.  This one was velvet, like Coming To America velvet.  I was in love.  (Insert second mint julep.)\n\nFor dinner...oh for dinner I had Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte.\"  This was a culinary masterpiece.  The best shrimp and grits I have ever had.  Creamy, spicy, perfectly cooked grits. The shrimp were huge, again perfectly seasoned and cooked. (Insert third mint julep.)\n\nNow you might say why the four stars?  Two things.  First:  The chairs in this place are crazy uncomfortable.  I am not kidding.  Who picked these torture chairs?  They have a raised lip around the edge of the seat that digs into the back of your legs. Check it out I swear.  Second:  When we arrived I told the waited we were going to be on a slow roll.  Please give us some time to eat and enjoy.  Five minutes after the first course came out the entr\u00e9es showed up.  We obviously had to send them back which I hate doing.  Now the manager came out and apologized and they fired us new meals which was nice but that kind of stuff makes me nuts.    \n\nBesides these two points you must go here.

I never knew my love for raw oysters until I came to this place (I don't get to experience this kind of freshness back home in Los Angeles). I also ordered the Luke burger and French 75. The burger was huge and it also came with homemade fries. I ended up taking half my burger to go. Even as microwaved leftover, the burger still remained juicy and tender. I would rate it as #3 on my list of best burgers. The French 75 is a must-try! It's a nice blend of cognac, lemon juice, and champagne. Best cocktail drink I have ever tried!\n\nI would definitely come back to this place next time I'm in New Orleans.

The atmosphere was sort of antique and classy - even the waiters/waitresses had doctor-like white coats on with ties - which I kind of enjoyed.\n\nPrices were a bit high, but the portions were sizable as a consolation.

Lets just say this dish changed my perspective on grits... and holy hell, it was delicious in all of its smoky, spicy, savory glory! \n\nBut the best part: their happy hour, which we happened to stumble in for because New Orleans is an amazing place where it runs all day beginning at noon!

Whatever issues I may have once had with this restaurant have dissolved completely, and I joyfully and enthusiastically pronounce my love for this wonderful little bit of heaven on earth. When we arrived for our latest evening of indulgence, we discovered that the menu had been changed and some of our old favorites were missing. My husband's mood downshifted from expectant to irritated very quickly, but he need not have worried; the items we chose were sufficiently delicious to turn things around. We started with our usual 2 dozen P&J oysters, which were better than they usually are here. I usually get a French 75 and/or a bourbon old fashioned here, and they're still some of the best cocktails in town. We had a little glitch with my husband's drink, which at first had no vodka in it and then, after being doctored up by the bartender, had way too much vodka in it. He switched beverages and all was well. \nSo one change in the menu was to add shrimp and grits (Shrimp En Cocotte), and, as this is one of my favorite dishes, I chose it. Good move. Their's may well be the best executed of this Southern standard that I've ever had; creamy and spicy roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits with smoky Andouille and green onion sausage, redolent of that full shrimp flavor that lets you know they've infused the dish with some stock, and sizable Gulf shrimp. Perfection. Really, if they never added another dish to this menu, I could be happy with this one forever. We didn't save room for dessert, but that didn't stop us from ordering one to share. If the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart with Coconut Sorbet is still on the menu when you read this, get it. Coffee as always is great here too.", "date": "2014-10-27 17:43:25"}

In all seriousness, those grits were ridiculously overpriced and should be an appetizer if they insist in serving sample portions to the \"paying hungry\".\nI understand that the location is probably very expensive and in my conclusions it is clear that this restaurant is over hyped. Thank you Travel Channel.\n\nWould I come again? Sure. (as long as someone else pays) Not worth the cents off a food lovers hard earned cash- there are others places in New Orleans worthy of charging like they do here.

We were seated right by the kitchen watching the chefs work through the glass. \n\n  They have a really nice raw bar with a variety of seafood from around the country.

While we waited we watch all the work go on in the kitchen. \n\n  I have to say I was a little disappointed at some of the practices going on in there.  They don't make the waffles fresh, they were kept in a warming drawer then put in the salamander to heat up. Which showed when the waffles arrived, they were pretty rubbery and the chicken was slightly undercooked.  The soft shell crabs were good, nice and crunchy and the eggs were poached perfectly but the sauce was a little overkill. It would have liked it to be an accompaniment rather then a soup of sauce. \n\n  What was disturbing to me was watching the grill man touch raw hamburger patties then touch cooked foods like French fries and the waffles.

I had built Chef Besh up so high in my mind I honestly thought he couldn't live up to it. Too unrealistic.  He did live up to my expectations and surpassed my dreams for a perfect dinner.\n\nAppetizer - Baked Oysters - sublime\n\nAppetizer 2 - Crab bisque - made many other crab bisque I have had pale in comparison (more soupy than bisque-y by the way)\n\nAppetizer 3 - (hey we were sharing!) Cold Shrimp- these were very good quality.  Only odd thing was I had to ask for horseradish / only served with ketchup.  A note on the horseradish.  If you like horseradish - order some on the side here just to try.  I don't know why or how but it is the best horseradish you will ever try and the most potent.  I wish I could get my hands on it to keep at my house. \n\nEntr\u00e9e 1 - Hamburger.  Just so wow you can't imagine how good until you taste it.  The meat is probably the tastiest hamburger meat I have ever had and I have had some pretty great burgers.\n\nEntree 2 - Blue Crab Cavatelli - pasta with red sauce with blue crab.  Just perfect.\n\nDessert - are you kidding?  After 3 appetizers and tasting a little of 2 Entrees dessert wasn't even a consideration.\n\nBottom line: Go, go, go, go, go, go!

So why, John, why do you forsake me now?\n\nDon't get me wrong: your $0.75 oysters during happy hour, up $0.25/each from the last time I was here, were cheap enough and the size of your head.  But it took so long to get them at 4:30 on a Saturday that your guy gave me half a dozen extra and a sheepish apology about being in the weeds.  Okay, well, these things happen.  \n\nBut tonight, my dear John, tonight was another story altogether.  I went with two friends of mine for dinner.  We had reservations at 8 and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was very nice, and tried real hard to remember your bourbon selection, but could only come up with Maker's Mark and Jim Beam.  We placed our drink and dinner orders, and waited.\n\nThe appetizers came out very quickly.  I was pleased because the service was so speedy.  But as we watched the kitchen activities from the table in the  back corner of the room, it became apparent that the speed with which we received our appetizers was not to be replicated with the entrees.\n\nWe waited. And we waited.  And we waited.  Our waiter never came back.   Not once!  He seemed to be ignoring us. Then a waitress came by. She said, \"I've just been to check on your order, and it's not ready yet. What did you order again?\" Does that make sense to you, John? It doesn't make sense to me. And we kept waiting. We could see our waitress in the kitchen. She was clearly trying to get something for us.  Finally, after five or seven minutes, out she comes with someone who must have been the manager, who is carrying a purse (something we all found to be very odd) and they were carrying two salads and soup.  The manager said that there had been a misunderstanding or a mix up or something, and dinner would not be for a little while, and for that reason they were offering us two different salads and a lobster bisque. She said, \"I don't know if you are hungry for these, but I hope that they will tide you over while you were waiting.\"  But all we really wanted was our dinner, John.  Was that too much to ask?\n\nWhen our dinner had finally come out, it had been close to 45 minutes after we finished our appetizers. Yes, the food was delicious, but there is no reason why we should've set onto it like ravenous vultures. There's no reason why it should've taken that long to get the food in the first place.\n\nAfter dinner, the waitress asked if we would like some dessert. We ordered one dessert for the table with three spoons and some coffee. It took a full 15 minutes to get the desert and the coffee on the table. In the process of eating the ice cream on top of my dessert, I found a small ice cube embedded in the ice cream.  How do ice cubes get into ice cream? The answer is beyond me.\n\nIn any case, John, the food at your restaurant was very tasty, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Do you think that it should take two hours and 15 minutes for three people to have a few appetizers, three entr\u00e9es, and a shared dessert?  I don't.  \n\nDearest John: you need to do something about the service in your restaurant. Giving your customers extra food because your kitchen or bar can't keep up with the orders is just shooting yourself in the foot.  Giving your customers extra food because your servers forget to place, fire, or hand off an order is also just shooting yourself in the foot.  Instead, you should probably just get the order right the first time. It seems pretty straightforward to me.\n\nI want to love you, John. I really do. Do you think you can improve on these things for the next time I'm in town?  If not, I may have to dump you for Donald Link.  \n\nLove, \nA foodie from DC", "date": "2014-11-18 05:48:41"}

I had read a couple blogs that had mentioned the restaurant and being a big Top Chef fan, and knowing who John Besh is, I had to try it. I really enjoyed the atmosphere however, there isn't anywhere to stand inside while you wait for your table. They do take reservations, so I definitely recommend doing that.\n\nFor starters we got a couple of bottles of red wine for the table. They were moderately priced, not too expensive. Then we got the Assiette de Charcuterie for an appetizer. I thought this contained cheese, but it didn't, so that was my fault for not being too excited when I saw a tray of unrecognizable meats. However, I will say all the ones I tried were good.\n\nFor my meal I had the Louisiana Blue Crab Cavatelli. It was really great but the portion was pretty small in my opinion. Since we were gearing up for a night out on Bourbon Street, I was hoping a pasta dish would provide me the perfect base. I did get the chance to try some of my friends left over Entr\u00e9cote Grillee et Frites which was my favorite of everything we ordered so I wished I had spent the extra $8 for it.\n\nOverall, a good restaurant, but I think for the amount of money spent, I might have found a more filling entree.", "date": "2014-11-26 16:39:55"}

I was meeting a dear friend I have not seen in 10 years, I wanted the experience to be memorable. Looking at the reviews and considering my previous experience at Mr. Besh's other restaurants, I made reservations for four at L\u00fcke. \n\nThe experience from start to finish was mediocre at best and rude at worst. Our friends arrived before us and they were having drinks at the bar. I greet them at the bar and walk over to the hostess stand to notify of our reservation. I couldn't get to speak the hostess for a good 10 minutes even though I was standing right in front of her because she was busy taking calls. She never acknowledged anyone standing in front of her, nor did she ask us to wait for a while. There were at least three parties that stood by the hostess desk waiting for her to get off the phone. Finally, after she got off the phone taking calls, she asks if I have a reservation. I gave her my name and said it is for 7:30pm but we are early and she says she cannot find the reservation. A moment of panic set in because I made the reservation two months ago and I was worried it may have been lost since then. After putting me on hold again to take a call, she resumes the search and says - with an eye roll - \"you made the reservation for 7 not 7:30\". Oh, ok. How dare I not remember the time?! And then she walks away...no words said. Baffled by this bizarre reception, I go back to the bar and order a drink with my friends. My husband offered to take over the \"wait at the hostess stand\" duty while I get a drink. The River Bend cocktail made with vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries, and ginger ale is excellent. The ginger and basil make the drink exciting. \n\nAfter another effort at the hostess stand we are finally seated. \n\nWe peruse the menu while catching up on the past 10 years and decide to order. Our server - Ben - was aloof from the start. Never once asked if we have any questions regarding the menu, didn't offer any drinks, and disappeared for extended periods of time. Halfway through the meal and noticing that every table around us has a bread plate, my husband asks for bread. Ben brings us some bread nonchalantly. After trying to get his attention a few times, and finally getting him to come to our table, i request a glass of wine with my meal, which arrived as I was about to finish my main course. A glass of wine should not take 20 minutes to arrive at the table...not in a restaurant of this caliber. All through the meal we had to flag other waiters to get water and wine because Ben was MIA.\n\nThis would have been a one star review if not for the food. The pate of Louisiana rabbit and chicken livers was a great start to my meal. Simply delicious! For my main dish I ordered the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" - a different take on the traditional shrimp and grits. It was excellent with the green onion sausage bits being my favorite. My dining companions all enjoyed their dishes. \n\nWe did not get dessert because we were asked or offered any. In fact, after being ignored for another extended period of time, we were offered the check, not dessert. I would have loved to try the chocolate bourbon pecan tart, but alas!\n\nWhile the food at L\u00fcke is stellar, the service from start to finish is abysmal. Somebody at this establishment needs to train their staff well. The silver lining of this entire experience is that I got to see my friend after a long gap of 10 years.", "date": "2014-12-10 18:21:16"}

Yes, 50 cents each, so splurge on a dozen or two. Of course, if you don't like oysters, just take me and I'll help you out.

I do have qualms with the price tag on this petite Crab Maison when comparing with similar restaurants, and it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped though the temperature was perfect and the bread that it came with was a nice crunchy texture to go with the meat. Size-wise though this IS an appetizer so be forewarned this is not an entree substitute which of those who got entrees are rightfully sized.  To fill my belly, I ordered a side of their jalape\u00f1o grits though it wasn't specifically on the menu (thanks!), and they are damn good. Perfectly creamy with a spicy kick. I will definitely have to try their shrimp and grits some time that they cook with these grits. \n\nOur waitress was attentive without being overbearing, and handled a neighboring situation of ornery guests very well without missing a beat with us. \n\nI'll definitely be back for Happy Hour at the bar sometime very soon!", "date": "2014-12-15 23:26:11"}

The noise level can get loud, but the energy in the room adds to the vibe of the restaurant.\n\nWhile there was no separate gluten free menu, there are several dishes that can be modified to be gluten free.The Washington Parish Roasted Chicken served during lunch is an extremely large portion and cooked well.

I do have to commend the server for being extremely helpful and patient when I continued to question about the cooking practices, i.e. sauces, pan fried vs deep fried, etc. If he wasn't sure, he went back and verified with the kitchen rather than just making up an answer on the spot.

Great flavors.\n-Mint Julep cocktail has fresh and tasted nice\n\nCons:\n-I ordered the second most expensive entree (Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"en Cocotte\" aka shrimp and grits) and was looking forward to a flavor explosion. It was served in a cast-ion casserole dish with a broken handle. I also noticed the portion looked small and like it was shoved to the right side of the dish (I compared it to the same entree that someone at my table was served. It looked like half the portion my friend received). There were also french fries in my entree, which didn't come with my dish, it just fell from other dish on the server's tray onto my dish. The server asked if everything looked good and I responded \"No, my dish has a broken handle, my portion looks half of what someone else got, and I got french fries in my dish that don't belong in the entree\". If this was a Chili's or some burger restaurant, no big deal, extra french fries, but I didn't know Chef John Besh was looking to create an upscale Popeye's. \n-Three of my friends ordered the grilled ribeye at different temperatures, but none were accurately served at the request temperature. The meats were not cooked consistently at the same temperature all the way through. Someone ordered medium, but the center of the ribeye was rare. \n-The service was really lackluster. The manager never came by to apologize about the shoddy plate they put in front of me.\n-The bathroom was actually in the Hilton and it was messy. I don't know about y'all, but if I'm in a nice restaurant, the bathroom also has to be well-kept.\n-It was my birthday dinner and my friends told the restaurant so they brought me out a dessert, but it said \"Congratulations\". I'm not sure what they meant by that. Congratulations you turned 30? It was just odd like they weren't paying attention and someone in the back was like \"Oh, there's some occasion at that table. Write 'Congratulations' instead of asking what the occasion was\". It just an example of lack of attention to detail from the famous Chef John Besh. \n\nThe more I write this review, the more annoyed I am that our group dropped all that money at this \"nice\" restaurant which was basically a glorified Red Lobster.", "date": "2014-12-18 00:57:26"}

We have our favorite restaurants but always try to sample a few new places as well. I have said before that its hard to find a bad meal in that town but Luke certainly provided for that this time. First off we showed up a little after 10 AM and was told the wait would be about 15 minutes, no big deal. We were seated within about 10 and the place looked fine. Well the hipster waiter that came over seemed to be in another world but did eventually convey to me that the listed breakfast menu on line was not available and we could only order from the brunch menu. I found this very odd and completely limiting at 10:20 AM on a Sunday morning. The brunch menu is very small and heavy on the seafood and nothing there sounded appetizing. I was going to just pass and have coffee while my wife ate but she insisted I order something. So I told our odd waiter that since I couldn't order any of the delicious sounding biscuit sandwiches or other \"Breakfast\" fair I would just have a hamburger. Well it took awhile but when it finally came it seemed the server had a real problem as to where to put things down on the table, I even joked that they hadn't really worked the whole \"table thing\" out yet. Well, the burger was messy and cold so after about 4 bites I just gave up. My wife also just ate her grits stating the shrimp tasted odd, and not good.  Now, as I looked around the room at people seated after us I noticed tables that had menus that looked much larger than our brunch menu and I saw plates with things like sausage and eggs on them. I was going to ask why I couldn't have ordered something like that but at that point I just wanted out of there. Now as if this meal wasn't weird enough the waiter came back to the table and insisted on shaking my hand as some sort of apology for how bad the whole experience was I guess. Anyway, we went around the corner and down the street to a small cafe and I had a delicious biscuit smothered in sausage gravy.  I would suggest that unless you enjoy the bizarre to forget about Luke  and try any of the many other places in the CBD", "date": "2014-12-30 01:26:09"}

We ordered the following appetizers: baked P&J oysters (6 in an order- they were good but I think we normally prefer them raw - we just wanted to try them since we're from out-of-town); the gumbo (tasty, so much flavor, not overly salty); the small raw seafood platter (Le Petit Plateau de Fruits de Mer) which came with raw clams, raw oysters, a squid/calamari ceviche/antipasto tasting, cooked mussels, and shrimp (if I recall correctly), and we added a half order of the jumbo king crab legs. The seafood platter was good (a good amount for 2 people if you want to try other appetizers). For the main course, I had the grilled louisiana mahi which came with kale chips at the time. The fish was fine (not overly fishy) but perhaps a bit overcooked, and the kale was too salty (felt like you were sticking your tongue in sea salt). My boyfriend ordered the Luke Burger medium rare but it came out medium well-- we didn't want to bother the servers since they were so great but the gumbo was probably the best dish that night. You can't be the service here, I would come back again!", "date": "2014-12-30 02:21:55"}

Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   \n\nI had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.

Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalape\u00f1o and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.\n\nThen I had pork schnitzel and \"pommes frites\" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it \"Southern\".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.\n\nI finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.\n\nA lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).

Either people had low expectations or they entered here drunk from an adventure at bourbon st or Frenchmen.\n\nI ordered a river bend and it was made absolutely horrible. It tasted like medicine or as if the vodka was randomly thrown in grape juice and ass. \n\nI ordered a charcuterie board, little neck clams, oysters, Brussel sprouts, and the shrimp grits. The charcuterie board and Brussel sprouts were amAzing. The Brussel sprouts had a seared and sweet vinaigrette flavor. Even though I really prefer the charcuterie sampler at cochon butcher over the charcuterie here it was still good. It came with a rabbit pate which was wonderful.\n\nAs we waited for our clams to come out, the server came to notify us that they were out of clams (thirty minutes later btw). So we ordered a half dozen oysters instead. Those came out within five minutes. However instead of getting a half dozen oysters, we ended up receiving only five oysters on our plate. WTF?!?! We notified our server and he ended up bringing us two additional oysters which was nice, but seriously?! How does a restaurant like this hire people that don't know the basics of counting? That right there made me question the quality of the restaurant and how overhyped this was due to john besh. The oysters were shucked wonderfully but that's really all I can give them credit for.\n\nAnyways, we finished all of our appetizers and waited an incredibly long time for the shrimp and grits. After waiting too long, we canceled our order with another waitress and our server finally came out to tell us that our order was ready but he wanted to wait for us to finish our appetizers to bring out the plate. I don't know of any restaurant that would make you wait an hour for your entree but sure... When the shrimp and grits came out I was honestly disappointed. \n\nI'm sorry to say but this restaurant may be nice but it absolutely does not deserve to be a four star restaurant. If you want good prices, good taste, and service I would go to royal house instead. Otherwise Ya no..... I would never go back here again nor recommend this place to someone else...

The cheese on top is overwhelming and makes the whole sandwich very soggy. i wish I had ordered something else.\n\nThe brussel sprouts were very good.\n\nBy the end of the meal, we had only seen our waitress maybe one additional time to order a second bottle of champagne.

I am all the way late on this one. I told y'all I hadn't been to New Orleans in 10+ years. It seems as though I am the very last person to have heard of and eaten at L\u00fcke. #fixed\n\nMy experience at L\u00fcke reminded me of why, even after that damned storm, New Orleans is the center of American culinary awesomeness. It just can't be helped. When I lived here, no matter if I was at a shack or an upscale, coat-only establishment, I don't think I ever had a bad meal. Ever. I'm serious. L\u00fcke keeps the streak going. \n\nI came here to meet and upon recommendation from my mentor. Yes, I have one. You should as well. This fellow set me on way wrt career choices, timing and strategy and it had been far too long since I'd seen him. Plus, he has fantastic taste in food/drink. We sat and were immediately greeted by that warm, chewy bread (with butter) I'd missed for so many years (yet instantly remembered once I smelled it). To my surprise, neither my mentor nor I wanted a drink. Where was I and who was I? No drink at lunch... in New Orleans? Something was amiss. I think I wanted to stay fully present in the conversation and meal. I stuck with my tonic and lime and availed myself of the $17 express lunch of the day. For less than $20, you get a cup of soup and the entree of the day. Being that it was Thursday, that meant my choice was the jambalaya. Done.\n\nIn no time, I was slurping on a bowl of hot, spicy, filling, decadent crab bisque. OMG. I'd missed eating like this. Eating is such a joy/(first world/privileged, I recognize) pleasure. To eat food that make your endorphins light up and mouth sing... it's a blessing. It is. The sweet crab meat was the star of the bowl. Not to be hidden amongst heavy cream, the shellfish was up front and present in every spoonful. I was feeling a wee bit full when my large plate of jambalaya arrived. The description said something about green onion sausage and andouille cracklin'. I dunno. All I know is as soon as the smell hit my noise, I couldn't get it in my mouth fast enough. Wait. I lie. I took a bite. Then took a bite of the corn bread. Then I crumbled the corn bread into the dish. Then I topped everything with a metric ton of hot sauce. THEN I put it in my mouth as fast as I could.\n\nOur waiter was pleasant, accustomed to the lunch crowd and delivered the type of service that I remembered, service that helped make New Orleans restaurants famous. Bellies protruding and mouths achy from laughter, my mentor and I bid farewell to L\u00fcke and got on with the business of the day. I was not even four hours into being back in The Big Easy and I didn't want to leave. A good meal and good conversation will do that to/for you.", "date": "2015-01-14 16:47:44"}

If only people didn't eat here, it wouldn't be so nasty.\n\nA little later another person came (maybe a floor manager or something?) and gave it another once-over with a DRY towel.

Talk about quick service! Should be a plus, but what it means is that they took the thing out of a fridge. We saw it: a platter of already-shucked oysters, pulled out of the fridge.

L\u00fcke, however, can itself have its share of problems .\n\n-- The front room can be (and often is) on the loud side, so much so that as a party of five at a rectangular table, it became difficult to hear. This is, of course, systemic and doesn't change. (The back room is quieter.)\n\n-- Bring Christmas night, I have to say both the kitchen and service were a bit \"off,\" but only in terms of timing -- NOT in terms of food (see below). Certain things came out almost too quickly; other things seemed to take forever. For example, L\u00fcke offered two types of oysters, and we ordered six of one, and a dozen of the other. The order of six came in a relatively timely fashion, but the 12 seemingly took forever, arriving long after the (cooked) appetizers were finished, and just before the entr\u00e9es. It also took a (relatively) long time to get the wine we ordered to accompany our entr\u00e9es. This, however, is more appropriately chalked up to Xmas night, rather than being \"the norm\" in our experience.\n\nThat said, the food was, as always, wonderful and delicious! The rabbit & chicken liver pate was silky smooth and satisfying; the brussels sprouts crispy and tasty; the crabmeat maison flavorful and tangy. The Drum was perfect, as were the shrimp & grits and the moules frites.\n\nL\u00fcke remains, for us, one of those places you can count on for good food and good drinks. It may not be our favorite place in New Orleans, but it always satisfies.\n_______________\n\u00b9 Formerly the Hotel New Orleans, formerly the W Downtown -- I guess it depends upon what day of the week it is.", "date": "2015-01-18 19:21:41"}

The hostess said the next reservation would be about a 30 min wait so we sat at the bar to watch the Greenbay vs. Seattle game since it's first come first serve. I was determined to eat here with all the great reviews about this place. \n\nThe guy sitting at the end of the bar ordered the crispy chicken and it looked so good I wanted to get it. The BFF was craving a burger. The bartender/waiter guy Brian told us the Crispy chicken and the stuffed French Toast just came out on their menu this week so we decided to go with that. \n\nI tried to go the safe route and ordered the Stuffed French Toast. It was very delicious! Almost like a dessert! Not your average French toast though. It looked like 3 crispy breaded patties but stuffed with chocolate, almost like Nutella and had a berry sauce on top with lots of cream on the bottom. Omg, it was really good but a little too sweet that I needed to take a couple bites of the BFF's Crispy Chicken which I regret not ordering. He always gets what I wish I should have ordered. \n\nThe Crispy Chicken was amazing! The biscuit was soft and sweet and the chicken and egg on top of it had so much flavor. Kind of reminded me of chicken and waffles sort of. But the downside was his chicken wasn't big enough. More biscuit than chicken. I should have ordered this! Slap myself for not going with my gut! \n\nSince we were at the bar we ordered a French 75 cocktail because it was a popular drink. Reminded me of a mimosa because it has champagne in it. It was really good! \n\nThis was my last day for now being in N.O. on 1/18/15! Nice day to spend Sunday Brunch with my BFF! Good times!", "date": "2015-01-19 22:19:52"}

Happy hour began at 3p, our reservation was for 3:30p. I recommend this as a midday meal, as the food and drink is top-notch, my husband's and my favorite meal of our trip. \nThe cocktail menu is strong, featuring perfectly executed classic cocktails. I recommend the French 75 and the Old Fashioned.\nThe oysters lived up to the hype - $0.75 oysters are delicious, large, fresh. Accoutrement are not lacking - lemon wedges, ketchup, horseradish, saltines. No shame in ordering dozen after dozen. In addition to the fresh oysters, we also tried a half dozen fried oysters. These were the most perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried oysters we'd ever had (and we've had oysters). They're served with a spicy buttermilk aioli - scrumptious! In addition, we shared a crispy brussels salad; as others have shared, this is how brussels sprouts should be done! Delicious!\nAfter our oyster feast, we weren't too hungry. We shared the daily special, a fried chicken served over red beans and rice. I did not have high hopes for this dish, as I perceived the oysters as the main event. Boy was I wrong! The shared dish was served separately plated, each in its own mini cast iron skillet.  Each bite of chicken was spectacular, succulent and flavorful. The beans and rice were perfectly upscaled peasant food and were the best thing we ate all day, perhaps all trip.\nService was excellent. Our servers kept our place settings tidy and our drinks replenished. I recommend dining here during happy hour in a tapas-type mentality, ordering dishes as you decide on them. Dishes were all prepared fairly quickly, and cocktails were there in between \"courses.\" All in all, it allowed us to have a long, luxurious meal at a very smart price.", "date": "2015-01-30 05:43:31"}

I actually drink the Mountain Valley Sparkling Water most of the time, with an occasional beer or wine, which are also half price for Happy Hour.

She immediate gave us some fabulous suggestions on popular desserts and offered us to get the Gateau Basque, because she's been eating it for years!\n\nThe waitress at the bar greeted us and was incredibly nice.

Before we finished, the lady in glasses came to check up on us again. She was very nice and asked to make sure that we enjoyed the food. She told us that she'll check on us again before we leave.

When I planned our trip to New Orleans, it seemed a no-brainer that we needed to try the NOLA Luke.. and I'm so glad we did. If it's possible, this location far surpasses the SA location in terms of atmosphere and quality. We were seated next to the kitchen which has windows to allow patrons to see all the action. It was a lot of fun watching the process of all the food being prepared and plated. We started with a River Bend cocktail (YUM!) and the Crispy Brussels Sprouts appetizer. Holy Hell. I have been scouring the internet trying to find a similar recipe and I can't find one.. the description doesn't mention that it's a spicy dish but don't let that scare you away. It might be one of the best things I've ever eaten. I got the shrimp and grits, because duh. New Orleans. My boyfriend got their Fresh Gulf Fish amandine style with the veggies. The first that night was drum and it was amazing. We opted against dessert because we had some sweets we'd picked up earlier in the day, but I have no doubts their desserts are as tasty as their entrees. If you've never been to Luke, I suggest you do it at least once in your life. You can thank me later.", "date": "2015-03-02 20:44:47"}

We each ordered a cup of seafood gumbo and shared a half dozen of the P&J oysters. The gumbo was a little too \"oystery\" for my taste. I'm more of a sausage and chicken gumbo person, but I wanted to try the one here. The P&J oysters were okay, but I just wasn't a huge fan of the herbsaint, persillade crust.

They're insanely simple and delicious. \n\nWe followed this appetizer with a crawfish bisque, which was also quite good. While I would have liked more crawfish tails included in the soup, the addition of a bread crumb stuffed crawfish head staring right back at you made the bisque a real treat!\n\nThe main dishes we shared were the Shrimp and Grits, and the Fried chicken on a biscuit. Both were mind blowing. The first involved Piping hot jalepe\u00f1o cheesy grits which paired perfectly with shrimp, sausage, and a subtle but spicy red sauce, and the portion was larger than expected. The\nFried chicken was...well...fried chicken. But the fluffy, honey soaked biscuit upon which it rested and the over-easy organic egg it supported, came together and made for a damn good entree. \n\nWant great service and excellent food at a reasonable price? Eat at L\u00fcke on Charles street. You will be glad you stopped by.", "date": "2015-04-12 20:04:39"}

His best work is on display at L\u00fcke's.\n\n----The Food----  \nJumbo Louisiana Shrimp En Cocotte ($24.00)- This dish is one of the more heavy, yet satisfying ones I had in NOLA.   It has roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages, with the juiciest, fresh shrimp I've had.  The seasonings and spices will give your taste buds a punch, leaving them in a daze and wanting more.  The grits were light and creamy balancing out the heavy sauce. Superb.  I just wish the portions matched the prices, as this dish isn't enough to fill me up.\n\nCroque Madame ($16.50)- Grilled ham & cheese sandwich with house-made fries and a fried egg on top.  Paying this much for a simple grilled ham, egg, and cheese sandwich is a crime.  While it's great tasting in its own right, I couldn't get over how I may have been able to make this in my own kitchen.   A knife and fork will be needed as you enjoy this classic sandwich. The house made fries were crispy and well done--they were amazing to eat with the gravy in the dish above.\n\nBrendan's Bread Pudding ($8.00)- One look and taste of Chef Besh's top selling dessert and you'll understand the love and warmth he has for his son, of which it is named after.  It's a small dish with vanilla bean ice cream & hot buttered pecan sauce covering a spongey, warm bread.  Definitely the most memorable dessert in NOLA.\n----\nConclusion: It's difficult to justify the prices when the portions are so small, even if the flavors of each dish were unique.  It'd be understandable if service AND atmosphere were amazing, but service needs improvement.  Right down to the host, server, and person I called to get the bread pudding to-go seemed impatient and had attitude.  I enjoyed the atmosphere though.\n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-I feel service could use improvement\n-Decor has a romantic, classy touch\n-Restrooms are clean", "date": "2015-04-16 03:53:20"}

She's not one for oysters or most seafood, but she thought she would take one for the team.  \n\nFirst bit of advice -- get a reservation.  Mrs. R. called around 2.30 and she was still able to get a reservation for us at 3.00 (I do not recommend calling this late, it just worked out for us).  When we got to L\u00fcke at 3.00, a table was ready for us, but folks who were walking in off the street just then to get a table were being told that they were booked up until at least 4.30; and, while the bar is open seating, it was absolutely packed.\n\nSecond bit of advice -- get the raw and the fried oysters.  The raw are absolutely gonzo, they were glistening and fresh and were gigantic.  Coupled with the traditional accoutrements of horseradish and ketchup for you to mix into your own personal blend of cocktail sauce, they are a fantastic treat; and for $9 / 12 they're a steal.  \n\nWhile I might be a big fan of raw oysters, I'm somewhat cool to fried oysters.  It's always seemed to me that battering and frying oysters robs them of their character and they're transformed into a mere vehicle for oil-crisped batter and dipping sauces.  These fried oysters were not those flavorless husks.  Probably because they started as the gigantic monsters that are shucked for the half-shell, each of the fried oysters is a well-balanced product of fried crispness and soft, buttery oyster.  As I mentioned, Mrs. R. set up this excursion so that I could get some fresh oysters, but she absolutely fell in love with the fried oysters.  Whether fried or raw, all of the oysters were so good that we ordered a dozen of each as a second round. \n\nIn addition to the special on oysters, the cocktail menu also features half-price drinks during happy hour.  Mrs. R. had a delicious Sazerac that had a lovely balance of liquor and bitters.  I had a mint julep, and though it did not come in the traditional cup, it did have a generous punch of bourbon, and a whole handful of fresh mint to accompany the crushed ice and simple syrup.  Delicious.\n\nWe liked the happy hour at L\u00fcke so much that while we were eating it, we were already devising plans on how we could make it back over multiple afternoons during our stay to enjoy more oysters and drinks.", "date": "2015-04-20 20:51:26"}

The crab omelette was a lot of food because it came with a mixed greens salad and a side of fries. The omelette itself was creamy and packed with crab, and the fries were crispy and salty. \n\nMy favorite breakfast dish ordered was the shrimp and grits--it was served in a skillet, with andouille sausage and a brown sauce. The shrimps were huge and cooked tenderly, and the farm fresh eggs on top added extra creamy texture to the grits. The description said 'jalape\u00f1o grits' but I couldn't taste any heat. This dish would be even more amazing if it came with a biscuit on the side to scoop up the brown sauce and grits. \n\nThe Pain Perdu was like a French toast with mascarpone spread and born slices separating the bread. Perfect balance of sweet and savory. \n\nWe returned to L\u00fcke for dinner, mostly for some small bites. Saw photos on Yelp of the charcuterie board and that appetizer is a must try!! There were 5 different types of cured meats on the board, including a duck sausage, terrine of pork shoulder, rabbit pate, and more. It was served with crusty bread, and able to be paired with whole grain mustard, horseradish mustard, bread and butter pickles, and pickled watermelon rind. AMAZING if you love trying cured meats. There was a balance of creamy textures in terrine and pate, and also a balance of fattiness and meat in the other meats. \n\nAlso ordered a small seafood platter, which had raw oysters, crawfish ceviche, and steamed clams, mussels, and shrimp. This platter was a hit or miss. The oysters were sweet and not briny or sandy, the crawfish was sour and had a little kick from the serrano chilis, but there was nothing special about the steamed options--the shrimps were slightly over cooked and hard to peel and the clams and mussels were only slightly flavored. For the amount of food served on the platter, it was worth $29 (something in California of that price, quantity and quality would have probably been about double the price). \n\nAlso ordered a side of Brussels sprouts, crispy and full of flavor in the chili oil, and extra crunchy in texture because it was topped with apples and almonds. \n\nLastly we had a bread pudding with pecan sauce and a scoop of ice cream. Excellent way to end a Southern meal! The top of the pudding was crispy, inside was moist, and the hot buttered pecan sauce wasn't overly sweet. I probably could have used double the amount that was plated. I am definitely glad I stopped in twice. \n\nThank you John Besh for getting both lunch and dinner spot on!!

On this trip to New Orleans they had hands down the best service out of the 11+ places I ate at. Water was always full.

Mr. Besh if you're reading this please message me your Brussel sprouts recipe!

But that's because I already make a damn good shrimp and grits. The pork schnitzel on the hand is worth ordering multiples of. First of all there's enough pig on this plate to serve two hungry guys. While the pork is cooked perfectly and it fried to a golden brown, it's the sauce that's the star of the show. You could put this sauce on top of balut (fertilized duck egg) and I'd eat a dozen of them. I sampled a few other dishes here as well and everything was great.

When I was doing research on Yelp, Luke came up when I filtered for \"Most Reviewed\" and it was a no-brainer that I should plan a dinner here for my girls and I. I was able to make reservations for 4 at 8 PM on a Sunday with no problems on OpenTable. We had no problems walking here from our hotel which was a block over from Bourbon St. \n\nWe arrived and the place was packed, both the front room and towards the back in the separate room which is where they sat us. We were lucky enough to be seated right next to the kitchen, where they had clear, glass windows and we could see all the chefs working hard preparing all the meals.\n\nEverything on the menu looked good, but I ended up ordering the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"en Cocotte\" ($24) which was comprised of Roasted Jalapeno Cheese Grits and Andouille & Green Onion Sausages. Seeing that the grits had Jalapeno cheese, I was worried because my spice tolerance is very low, but when I asked the waiter, he confirmed that the dish wasn't spicy and that the Jalapeno cheese just gave the grits flavor. I'm glad I listened to him and went ahead with ordering that. \n\nThe food took a little while to come out but we understood because the place was really busy and you could see them working non-stop in the kitchen. The Shrimp & Grits were sooooo good. The Jalapeno cheese added another level to the dish and it complemented the hearty, flavorful sauce that the Shrimp were swimming in. I'd never had grits because and I kept forgetting they were actually grits because the sauce was all over them. Thickness-wise, in my opinion, they were probably similar to mashed potatoes but definitely grainier but I didn't mind them and I'm glad that my first experience to Southern grits was in this beautiful dish. I forget what my friends ordered but all I remember is everyone loving their dish.  They all seemed to enjoy mine as well. Also for all of you Gluten-free folks, the waiters will tell you what could be made GF so you don't need to rule this restaurant out if you'll be eating with someone with Celiac disease. Even though we were stuffed, there's always room for dessert so at the recommendation of our waiter's we ordered the Steamed Chocolate to share and it was heavenly! \n\nI'd definitely recommend Luke if you want a nice dinner!", "date": "2015-04-27 18:20:37"}

So I brought my cousin here for her first time to indulge in the goodness. Mind you we want to Emerial's the night before which was also her first time and the service as usual was bar none.\n\nSo I wanted to introduce her to my other favorite chef in Nola's cuisine. \n\nWe walked in and I should have known something was off. The 2 hostess were not friendly especially the one with dark hair, large eyes,  drags her feet when she walks, and rolls her eyes at customers who is disturbing her morning (I asked for her name and was told he didn't know). It was so bad I just watched her even when we got seated and could not believe she was at the front of the house. The trash can behind the check in desk was overflowing and my cousin said that would never happen at Emerial's whom as soon as you take a sip of your water someone swoops in like dark Vader and fills your glass.\n\nAnyway, we got seated after standing there for 18 min, no biggie. Our waiter Nicolas brought us a brunch menu and I said can we also see the breakfast menu since brunch technically starts at 10. It was 9:48 and he looked at his watch and said a unenthusiastic yep and brought the breakfast menu. Then I tell you know lie the first words out of his mouth when he sat the menus down was \"So what do you want\".. My reaction was like an old school episode of Punked. I said we need a minute.\n\nWe ordered a stack of pecan pancakes and shrimp and grits. \n\nWhen he brought us our food we being the yelpers we are we took our photos. He then says \"Yea girl Instagram my shit\". My biggest pet peeve Just because I am black don't assume I talk like a stereotype. I stated actually this is for yelp.\n\nSo he walked off, my cousin still mouth on the floor appalled. The pancakes came in a thin stack of seven with about a teaspoon of pecan butter on top. So we asked Nicolas for more butter. He says \"You want that exact butter? We said yes and he said \"I have to get it from the kitchen. Exactly 15 minutes later he sees that we haven't eaten the pancakes and says I don't know why they haven't brought you any butter I told them too. All this is while he fills the water glasses of the other tables and fills my glass with what's left in his pitcher and never comes back with more, see my pic.\n\nSo we then asked a nice guy who was cleaning tables if he could get us some butter and he was back within 5 min. However the pancakes were now cold and so was the butter so it was over. We told Nicolas and he said OK I will take it off the bill and then just brings us our check. He didn't offer to remake them, given us something different or even ask he wanted us gone. My cousin couldn't believe how mad I was and I told her this was more than a let me talk to the manager situation this was full blown Letter to the company situation. \n\nAll in all we split the Shrimp and grits which were delicious and that's it and left hungry. We had to go somewhere else to eat after.\n\nThis day was beyond embarrassing to the John Besh name and with the mecca of food in Nola you can't slack on service. Now my new foodie cousin can care less who John Besh is and how amazing I say he is because all she remembers is being treated worse than a waffle House at 2am. \n\nI hope management reads this and addresses those staff member because this day was beyond any experience I have ever had in a restaurant on its worse day.", "date": "2015-05-07 03:00:13"}

I went to Luke with two friends for dinner last Thursday and ate one of the best meals I've ever had. EV. . . ER. The service (thanks Richy Rich!) was amazing. And the food was spectacular. \n\nWe started with the Brussels Sprout Salad. The brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly and tossed with little hot peppers in this sweet/spicy Asian type sauce. And some of the outer leaves had fallen off the sprouts and were slightly crispy. Every single one of us expressed an uncontrollable moan of pleasure at the first bite. There may or may not have been a fork fight immediately following that as we all tried to bogart as much of the salad as possible.\n\nThen one of my friends and I were trying to decide between the same two dishes, so they brought each of us a half portion of the two dishes. The first was the shrimp etouffee a la Harry (shrimp etouffee with fried shrimp on top). If I could only have one dish for the rest of my life, this would be it. When you think fried shrimp, don't think butterflied and breaded, think flash fry. It added another element of taste and texture to an already perfect dish. Phenomenal.\n\nThe other dish was the fried catfish topped with crawfish. I will preface this with the admission that I'm not a catfish person. I don't typically enjoy it, so I don't get it. However, the description looked so good that I was tempted. And I'm glad I tried it. I'd order it again (if they were out of the shrimp etouffee :)). It was really tasty. So if you're not a catfish person, definitely try it, it might change your mind. \n\nOur other friend ordered a hamburger. Seriously. A hamburger. There's no accounting for taste, but he said that it was the best burger he'd ever eaten. So there you have it. If you want to go to a renowned restaurant and order a burger, know that at least it'll be a darn good one. But if I were you, I'd go with the shrimp. You won't know what hit you.", "date": "2015-05-11 16:25:31"}

I think you can get validated parking at the Hilton but it seems expensive.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It's inside the Hilton but you dont have to go into the HIlton to get into the restaurant as it has it's own entrance.  You'll see the \"Luke\" sign when you are walking in.\n\nThere are places to sit in the very front, in the middle, and then if you go totally in the back there are more tables even further up.  It has that ind of New England trendy vibe to it.  Definitely a \"nicer\" restaurant, but casual enough you dont have to dress up to come inside.\n\nFOOD: They give you long \"breadstick\" type loaves of bread to eat with creamy butter.  Our only gripe was that he gave us 3 sticks for 9 of us so we had to constantly ask for more.  It was good though - very warm and crusty but soft on the inside.\n\nBRUSSEL SPROUTS - very tasty.  Has some mint in it making it taste sort of like vietnamese food and there are some peppers so it could be spicy but this was a perfect side dish to have some veggies. \n\nSHRIMP N GRITS - I think the name is something else on the menu but this was SO good.  Definitely worth sharing with someone.  They put a delicious broth/sauce over the grits with some cheese and shrimp.  The shrimp were fresh and the sauce totally gives the grits an amazing taste.  Very flavorful.\n\nSHRIMP AND CAVATELLI ETOUFFE - I think I spelled it right! This is a past dish, cavatelli is almost like gnocchi because it is a potato-y type of pasta that is oval shaped.  The sauce was good (almost like pan roast) and the shrimps were tasty too. This and the shrimp and grits would be my go to choices.\n\nMy friends also got the seafood sampler for $24 which looked very fresh and good if you like oysters, shrimp, clams/muscles etc.\n\nBREAD PUDDING - small enough for 1 person who likes this and big enough to share in a group if everyone wants a small bite.  It wasnt runny and the ice cream on top was refreshing.\n\nOverall - good if you want a more trendy/nice atmosphere without spending a ton of money.

The grilled oysters were quite good.  We also got the baked brussel sprouts appetizer. Even guests who swore they did not like brussel sprouts were observed eating them!  The crawfish bisque was tasty, but a bit too salty.   The roasted chicken, grilled gulf fish, and crawfish risotto were very well received.  Desserts were equally good.  An expensive restaurant but well worth the price if you want to treat yourself or others to an excellent meal and experience.\n\nWe stopped by the bar for Happy Hour one evening.  Drinks half price and oysters $0.75 each.  Great value and very fresh oysters.  Happy Hour was very crowded with no tables available for seating.  Seems to be very popular and I can see why!\n\nUpdate:  Return visit 3/2016.  Still one of the best restaurants in New Orleans.  Great food.  Service was very spotty.

I ordered it well which is sometimes not a very good decision but it was still a good moist burger. High quality meat professionally cooked.  I actually ate the burger, (well half of it)  with no condiments.  Also a testament to the tastiness.  The shoestring fries were decent as well and over flowing from the little holder.  I personally prefer steak fries and less salt. but I still did manage to eat them all over the remainder of the work day.\n\nService, meh; ambiance, meh; parking, don't get me started.  However, I attribute all of those things to being in the CBD during lunch hour.  If any of those would have been above average, it probably would have been a 5 star for me.

Very easy to get to and accessible parking all around. Going in, I expected the food to be the typical fresh local flavor that you get at all the Besh restaurants but the lunch I had exceeded my expectations. I will tell you that if you only ordered the Brussel sprouts, you will leave happy. Very rich with great flavor and kick that will surprise even the Brussel sprout hater. The drum or snapper almandine is fantastic! I ordered mine blackened but both are fantastic. I had Mauthes cheesecake which is right in line with the local selection of mushrooms that Besh serves up. The cheesecake, topped with a blackberry sauce should not be missed. The service on my two visits was only adequate and should be kicked up just a notch but the food continues to speak volumes and I will definitely be visiting again!\n\nAlso, one of my go to places for raw oysters.

My wife tried to order the crispy soft shell crab for an entree, however we were told they had run out and the server recommended she try the shrimp and grits as an alternative (it was very tasty and I actually enjoyed the grits which I'm usually not a big fan of), but still left us wondering if the soft shell crab would have been even better?\n\nI originally ordered the Washington parish roasted chicken... Not only did it come out cold but I found there to be a tremendous lack in flavor and I expressed my discontent with the dish to our server after a couple of bites (something I rarely do). I had it sent back and decided to go the safe route and ordered the Luke Burger because I had heard good things about it.

The staff was very attentive and friendly. We always had our water glasses filled to the top, and one of the servers assistants came by to change our white table top cloth (which was a little dirty from our appetizers and entrees) while we were waiting for our dessert. We told him that it was ok and that we were just going share a quick dessert and didn't want to dirty another table cloth, but he insisted that it would be his pleasure to change it for us.

The crab ceviche was not a highlight - very disappointing that it didn't taste clean. The clams tasted fishy. The mussels were good (simple). The oysters had great flavor but whoever was shucking that day did a poor job. There was grit and bits of shell in both sets of oysters we had. The shell should have been cleaned out before serving. We mentioned to both of our servers (the gal was especially friendly!) but both said that was normal and they would let the person shucking know. We've had oysters many times and that is rare to find if you're cleaning your knife and checking the oysters. For the price you pay I was very disappointed in the raw bar. I recommend elsewhere to get your fresh seafood fix in new Orleans.", "date": "2015-07-19 14:53:07"}

Anytime I had a question he would answer in a rather \"annoyed\" way like it was a pain for him to have to take the time and answer it. Also, we had the check split 3 ways, yet as we went to leave and my friends had already left and I stayed to ask if he had added the tip to the bill (as it seemed more than it should have been), he said he did to theirs but not to mine( I had ordered an extra beer so mine should have been a tad more than theirs) That was a little weird to me...but I took him at his word and gave him a cash tip.

Pavlova needs tart fruits, not over-sweetened sweet ones.\nCoffee:  ordered with the Pavlova, came when the pavlova was half done.  \n\nI never saw the female waitress again until she picked up the check with my form of payment that the had been dropped off.  Maybe my table of one disappointed them?\n\nI would give this place a try again, but nothing about it was outstanding... Perhaps the 2000+ reviews are from tourists who are used to eating from fast food chains and other mediocre places.", "date": "2015-08-05 02:39:34"}

My friends and I frequently come in for oysters, appetizers and half price wine. I've tried pretty much every oyster happy hour in the city, and Luke has the consistently freshest tasting oysters around with other delicious raw bar offerings on the menu as well. I'm wondering if that's why they upped their price per oyster to 75 cents? I have tried some of their entrees, but I've found that I enjoy trying a bunch of the smaller items/appetizers more. The crispy brussel sprouts, flamenkuche, and the pate are amazing!\n\nTheir cocktail selection is good too, but their wine menu is where it's at. I just can't pass up the Simmonet Febvre they've had on the menu this summer.\n\nI would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. I've found it to be unnecessary a few times over the summer, but during the high season, I usually have trouble getting even a table for two right away if I just walk in.\n\nI've always had great service when I come in.

She turned around and sent a trainee-looking guy to us and never spoke to us again. (You could tell because they don't take orders, dress slightly differently, and mainly clean up dirty plates from tables.)\n\nI don't mind being served by a trainee, but our glasses were empty the whole time and no one bothered to add water. It was very hard to get the second guy's attention because we sat where most customers were served by the first server.\n\nI noticed our second guy served all Asian customers who sat in various areas. I hoped this was a coincident.\n\nI'm usually very polite to my servers. I understand how stressful their jobs are and I respect them a lot. I don't need everyone to put on a smile while serving but at least I shouldn't feel neglected with no water and no plate for bread, or being treated as a less valuable customer while people next to us were getting a five-star treatment.

Combined with a \"l\u00fcke\" warm roll for $18, it's a pretty solid deal. I opted for the cup of seafood gumbo as my soup; it was delicious, perfectly cooked melding the plentiful array of oysters and shrimp with some lagniappe of andouille and okra. When the chicken came out I was surprised how large of a portion it was; not overwhelming, the perfect size in fact, I just figured they would cut corners for Coolinary. Not only that, the chicken sat on an abundant delectable mound of red beans & rice! They were about the best damn RB&R I have every tasted; they smoke pork butt then let it cook down into the red beans. Not exactly an energy booster, but, they are frankly, to die for. The chicken was also cooked perfectly; the meat fell right off the bone and the batter was perfectly fried in both flavor and crispness. While I ate all the chicken I had about 2/3rds of my RB&R left. I'll happily enjoy those at a later juncture. The ticket time was 4 minutes for the gumbo and 12 minutes for my chicken; perfect for those on the go or the working business class! \n\nFinal Thoughts: It really was worth it if you want to venture into the CBD on a work day.

First I been wanting to go here for a while now and follow Chef John Besh . I guess I could fly to the Luke's in San Antonio, it's closer. lol\nWell we got up early to get here for breakfast on the day we were flying out Monday August 3rd, 2015.  It was about maybe 8am when we got there and looked like we were the only customers so far.  It looks like a really fancy place, but they are very nice and the prices are not expensive at all and the portions are great, but the quality and taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!!!!   So our waitress \"Nicole\" was helpful and nice, but i also knew exactly what I was getting and also some stuff to try before getting there. She was a Local girl who's from Maui. So her and I chatted and my pidgin accent started to come out.  So this is the low down on what we got:\n\nFresh black coffee was delicious & fresh and I don't usually drink coffee nor do I like it black.\n\nVirgin Bloody Mary was just what I needed from Drinking too much the night Be4 and it was tasty.\n\nChicken Tobasco honey sandwich that came with Grits - Very yummy, but the Grits were the STAR and talk about it here in a few.\n\nFamous Shrimp & Grits w/Lump Crab topped off w/over easy eggs.- This was what I came here for initially and it was delicious, but there was just a lot going on in flavors, next time I won't mess with perfection and keep it simple with just \"shrimp w the grits\"  \n\nEgg White Fritata my friend been craving eggs whites - It was good, healthy wise, but we should've ate this first because after tasting the grits and other dishes, this tasted somewhat bland. It by no means was bland, but you can't mix healthy when your eating gluttonous rich tasting dishes.  It did taste delicious several hours later. We ended up taking this to go.\n\nFries - Now these were actually horrible and burnt like. I like crunchy fries, but only if the inside is also soft and fluffy. We ate a few pieces and they were so bad we didn't even bother taking it to go and wasted the whole thing and just left it there. It basically looked untouched. The only Bad thing and so not worth getting. \n\nNow the grits.  OH MY FREAKEN GOSH!!!  This was just a shocker! So I didn't  know that my sandwich came with grits and I decided to just taste it with a spoon.  As soon as it hit my mouth, all my taste buds EXPLODED in Ecstasy!!  I was soo blown away and couldn't believe it so I took another spoonful and closed my eyes & was in Food Heaven!! My friend was like \"no way is it that good\", then tried it and was experiencing what I just had!  Ecstasy!  It was just basic no frills grits!!!  It was sooo dang good!! We ordered 2 more on the side.  they had a jalapeno one, so we got on of each.  Now mind you the jalapeno grits were delicious and not too spicy, but When it comes to PERFECTION, the plain grits is THE BEST EVER!!!!  Oh my gosh, how can a small side dish steal the show?!! It was crazy! We had delicious entree's, but yet all we could rave, crave and talk about is the Grits!I   I am going back to NOLA, just because of the food here.  Luke's, Green Fork  and SEED are 3 reasons I am going back just for a weekend trip so that I can eat heavenly.\n\nThe Grits are the MAIN reasons why Everyone needs eat here!!!!  I can still taste that nice creamy, not watery at all and just the perfect amount of butter to it. I didn't even have to add salt or anything. If I could only have one dish before die, not meal, but \"dish.\"  This would be it!!!!", "date": "2015-08-18 17:21:45"}

They used to have daily specials where you order get an entree and a cup of soup for about $20 and that is gone. The menu has been reduced a bunch of high priced items that you would have expected from August or any of his other places that you didn't get here. Luke was like a neighborhood kitchen that served really good food at a good price but now he has gone for the tourists instead of the locals and it shows in more ways than one. They have added more tables and crammed the small interior, the tables are now so small you really can't fit the oyster trays on them comfortably when seating a table of 3 or 4. The oysters themselves were the worst I have ever had from them with about 3 that were not opened that I had to open at the table. Gumbos normally come with hot french bread and they only brought one for a table of three where they are supposed to be given to each person not per table. The oysters have really turned into a lost leader to get you in the door and spend a check that you really were not anticipating. They have baked oyster not char broiled at a whopping $17.50 per half dozen. My friend though it was for a dozen and ordered the half not knowing the $17.50 was for the half dozen which made the situation even worse. To top it all off we were there for a birthday and notified the hostess and the waiter and there was no recognition with a dessert or not even a happy birthday from the waiter. From start to finish this was a miserable experience and one that I was not expecting from a John Besh restaurant and is not qualified as a TOURIST TRAP. In fact this place has changed so much they really should start over with their reviews because many on here were for the previous chef and menu.", "date": "2015-09-06 23:12:31"}

Maybe the oysters have escaped.\n\nOur oysters finally come after an hour of waiting for them, and they're ok. My matza ball soup is pretty much tasteless. The broth has a slight chicken flavor but other than that, nothing. The gumbo my friends got was tiny. Our waiter has now not talked to us or checked on us in well over an hour.

Our waiter was not very talkative, he just took the order and brought the food. That is totally fine with me. But when we put our napkins down, and sat for him to come over and ask us if we were finished or wanted dessert... He didn't... He walked over and picked up one plate, and I told him we are ready for the check. He didn't clear the table like he should have, he picked up one plate, ignored and didn't acknowledge me and walked off. My friend said to me, I don't think he heard you. Well obviously he did because he brought the check and put it on the table and walked off!!! He NEVER said a word. Never said THANK YOU. Nothing. From the very beginning I just felt like he hated his job or was having a bad day, so my friends and I were being considerate and just tried to look past his grumpy miserable face. So we asked to split the check and he came back asking about tip to make sure we tip on the card since we split it etc... So basically he was assuming that we might forget or not tip or something. Then he came back to drop off the cards and we still gave him a 20% tip because we are just too nice and know what it's like to be in this industry. We no longer are in the service restaurant industry but used to be in the past for 10 years! So when he dropped the cards off, I asked him \"are you having a bad day?\" He smiled and said no im not having a bad day. Then walks off. It was the most uncomfortable smile... Because he never smiled until then. Honestly I felt like he was making assumptions from the start when we sat down. He did give us a look when we said we were going to share everything because as foodies, you want to try more than one plate to yourself but not over order and be disgusting full... And be able to go onto the next food stop later. But seriously I'm probably under describing the whole situation. He was so rude. You can be rude without talking and making the rude actions and not acknowledging. Just terrible, we should not have to feel like we didn't belong, not welcomed or didn't want to be waited on or if waiting on us was just a miserable hassle. No one should have to feel like that!\n\nWe went to Restaurant R'evolution and Commander's Palace the previous two days and the food was amazing and the service was more than perfect. Maybe you should send your staff and pay for them to eat there to see how it is to be a nice friendly waiter....\nI'm just speechless at today's experience and restaurants like this need to be aware that there are countless other restaurants offering both amazing wonderful food WITH good service. \n\nOn to the next amazing restaurant on my list. \nDon't care to ever come back.", "date": "2015-09-28 18:22:22"}

It's a great time to sample a drink you may have been wanting to try, like the Sazerac or French 75, both N'awlins 'native' 'must try once drinks'. I love the French 75 here; unlike some other establishments, Luke creates this special concoction with no gin, just enough lemonade, atop a small cherry, bitters and champagne.. the attentive bartenders even swirl a ' 75' or a pink heart atop the goodness. We made this our go to hh spot during our week in Nola. Can't find a place at the bar, no worries, you can enjoy the great hh prices from a table; another rarity. Great cappuccinos, which the bartender even suggested I try a smooth shot of a liquor called 43 / Cuarenta y Tres with: SOLD. We sampled bubbles including a nice Pinot Noir bubbly from France. We opted for dinner here one night , as well. I highly recommend reservations because the place gets packed and seemed to stay that way. For dinner I had the crab bisque , the best I've had in Nola , believe it or not. I say that , because I like the bisque to have pieces of crab throughout, and this one did. For my entree, I had the ribeye with maitre de butter and topped with crab. The ribeye was tender, but fatty. The waiter offered to take it back , but I did love the flavor and ribeye is not a filet!

The restaurant is in the Hilton Hotel but with a separate entrance. Though the ambiance is upscale, the atmosphere was very relaxed and casual, buzzing with patrons ranging from families with kids, girls on a night out, couples on dates, etc. You get the picture - everyone's welcome.\n\nThis was our first meal on our trip where we actually felt hungry before eating. That said, we went crazy and ordered quite a few things between two people.\n\nThe bread that started us off was warm but we knew better than to get full from that. We however indulged ourselves more than we should with the vibrant and earthy PATE of Louisiana RABBIT & CHICKEN LIVERS ($11). I ate this with sweet peppers, blueberry preserve, table pickles, relish, and honey grain mustard atop a nicely crisp crostini. It was fabulous. I had fun with mixing and matching all the sides because everything seemed to work together. That jar of pate was begging to be licked clean, I tell you.\n\nSEAFOOD GUMBO a LA CREOLE ($10/bowl) was served on a tin cup then poured over the rice on the bowl. This was mighty tasty for our first gumbo on this trip and hearty as should be. A cup might have been a more appropriate portion for us though.\n\nWe initially had no greens added to our order but our server raved about the BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($12), crispy and glazed with honey siracha. Now, how can we possibly say no to that? One bite was all it took for us to know we made a wise decision.\n\nOur main dish was no other than the JUMBO LOUISIANA SHRIMP EN COCOTTE ($24). Wow, the shrimps were huge and succulent, the roasted jalapeno cheese grits were creamy and hearty, while the Andouille & green onion sausages were flavorful and added a kick - oh my palate was dancing and singing with joy! It was nice of them to serve this on split cast irons since we were sharing. The portion was just right, in fact, because the food was rich, you'll get easily stuffed. \n\nI don't know how we did it but trying BRENDAN's BREAD PUDDING ($8) was the very 2nd reason (next to the shrimp and grits) why we booked a table at Luke's. Our stomachs probably knew better and paved the way for its presence because man was it off the charts scrumptious in every way. The vanilla bean ice cream and the hot buttered pecan sauce were literally the icing on this cake. \n\nI have no complaints!

It began with huge raw oysters that were succulent and salty needing no additional condiments. My party then had the baked oysters which were again excellent, oysters on the half shell baked with fresh shrimp and crabmeat. Then we were treated to a chef's special called Flammenkuchen. The Flammenkuchen was a German style pizza with pork belly, caramelized onions and Emmenthaler cheese, that was unbelievable. The next course was a cup of gumbo which is always a staple for me anytime I come to Luke, a dark rich roux filled with seafood and sausage. The main course was their number 1 seller the famed shrimp and grits which was the best shrimp and grits I have ever had. The sauce was rich and full of flavor probably also made with a roux with huge shrimp, soft creamy grits and cheese. For dessert we settled on the bread pudding that was served in a souffl\u00e9 dish served with a great pecan reduction sauce. Ask for Tristan if your going for dinner, he provided great service all evening long. This was from start to finish the best dinner I have ever had.", "date": "2015-10-25 21:03:02"}

It's fancy fried chicken really, that's hard to mess up. Come with 3 so it good to share among a small group.\n\n--Fried Chicken and Biscuit - still drooling about this dish as the chicken was incredibly tender inside. The biscuit is different as it seems more like a glazed puff pastry. I wish they gave you a Tabasco honey dispenser to  top off the dish as much as you want because it was incredibly addicting.\n\n--Shrimp and Grits - literally still don't know what grits are as a sheltered Northerner but I'll buy into it. This place does it well and it tastes like mashed potatoes' Southern cousin topped with andouille sausage, and of course we had to add poached eggs on top. This dish definitely sets my standard from now on.\n\nMy friends seemed to love their crab bisque and soft shell crab. I still chuckle to myself that the servers and staff wear lab/clinic coats as their attire. Our guy was very apologetic that we kept missing out on the complimentary soft baked bread as it kept running short.

I chose Luke this go around over his other restaurants in the area because I had heard about Oyster happy hour.  Our entire experience did not disappoint!  We started with some extremely fresh raw and fried oysters during happy hour so we got them at the happy hour price.  The friend oysters took a little extra time so they actually ended up taking them off the bill with no complaints from us just because they felt it was the right thing to do.  My boyfriend and I shared the shrimp and grits with the crab.  Don't question it...ADD THE CRAB!  It would have been delicious without but it took it to a whole new level.  My boyfriend is NOT a fan of grits but these jalapeno cheddar grits completely converted him. We also shared some frites which were quite delicious but I had wished I had not added those so I could have had room for dessert.  Lastly I have to say the cocktail list was pretty unusual and the happy hour pricing certainly made it easy to try several!  My new favorite is the French 75!  I have tried with little success to have it made for me back home.  The cocktail alone is worth a trip to Luke in my opinion!

This was recommended restaurant while in the Big Easy and I am so glad we listened.  We visited this location on a Sunday around 2:30pm and it was pretty busy.  It was Halloween weekend and a home game for the Saints.  For just two of us was a wait of 45 minutes.  We lucked up and got a seat at the bar right in front of the shucking station.  \n\nWhile sitting at the bar we were able to see alot of food being delivered to everyone's tables and I must say EVERYTHING LOOKED GOOD.  My friend got the Shrimp and Grits which is suppose to be one their best dishes along with their oysters.  I didn't want to get the same thing and I decided upon the Crab omelette and the seafood gumbo as an appetizer.\n\nThe gumbo was delicious!  Some of the best I had while in the French Quarters.  And trust me I had alot of good gumbo during my 5 days here.  It wasn't runny and cling to the rice as GUMBO SHOULD.  It had sausage, shrimp and mussels ;)  Talk about perfect.  The gumbo was so good I literally came back about 5 hours later to get some more to go.  I am not exaggerating !  \n\nMy crab omelette arrived shortly after and the presentation along had me sold.  The eggs were perfect and so light and fluffy.  Inside the omelette their was cheese, crab, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  The crab meat was so sweet and perfectly seasoned. They really set the bar for a good omelette.  The dressing on the salad was so light and full of flavor.\n\nThe employees that work at the restaurant is what really sealed the deal for me.   The staff really works together to make sure their customers enjoy their experience.  I could really tell everyone really enjoy their jobs.  \n\nThank you Luke for the amazing experience!

Yes I bought John Besh's first cookbook and have enjoyed making many of the recipes - but I have been craving Luke's redfish court-boullion (Friday special) and have been nervous about tackling the recipe. \nHusband and I were recently on a chartered cruise that had a port stop in New Orleans - on a Tuesday. A few weeks prior I contacted the restaurant with a special request for the court-boullion for lunch on that day.  There was a nice email exchange with a couple of folks and the answer was a very gracious YES and I was so excited!\nOur lunch that day at Luke was the absolute highlight of our wonderful but too short visit to the city. Our server Savannah was absolutely delightful - I thanked her for accommodating my special request (I don't think I've ever ordered \"off the menu\" before so this for me was a very special request). She explained that they always like to accommodate special requests ***as long as they are given ample notice*** which I think is so generous. And certainly I would never have requested the court-boullion last minute, after all, I've seen the recipe!!! Anyway we settled in and husband ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts - so delicious and imaginatively prepared. He also ordered the wiener schnitzel that he fondly remembered from previous visits - it was fork tender with a crispy yummy crust - huge portion. I ordered the crab bisque to accompany the redfish court-boullion. Am not exaggerating when I say that the bisque was the most delicious soup I have ever tasted. The court-boullion may have even been better than I remember - the flavor combination is unique and such a taste treat. We also enjoyed a unique appetizer of pate with various mustards and relishes.  Okay - then it gets even better. We ordered the bread pudding - but of course, because I remembered it to be the very best anywhere. It still is the very best anywhere. The sauce is killer - a butter rum goooooooey ooze of deliciousness with crispy sugared roasted pecans all over, with a huge scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream on top. Oh no, and we also were served a warm cherry apple strudel with salted caramel ice cream on the side.  I am salivating just remembering all this while writing.  \nNeedless to say, our experience went far beyond our already high expectations.  We were treated like royalty- or maybe dear family (even better) by Savannah and staff, we were thanked by the assistant manager as we left.  All in all it was an unforgettable experience and we cannot wait to return.", "date": "2015-11-06 20:52:02"}

The yogurt and granola featured no more than three tablespoons of insubstantial, powdery granola and perhaps half a cup of berries for $12.

He comes back with the wine and we add on the cold seafood platter. I'm not sure how long we waited but the server comes back and says the appetizers are taking a little long and asked if we wanted something else in the meantime. We order the Brussels sprout and shrimp and grits. \n\nOur seafood platter comes out. We finish and we wait. We flag down our server to check in on the first appetizer and he goes he knows what happened, mix up with neighbors food. He said it should be coming out right now. As we wait our neighbors put in their orders. \n\nFinally our stuffed oysters come out and we down those as our neighbor receives all of their food. We anticipate our meals should be coming as we ordered way before them and happy we got some food to hold us over. We wait and wait. It's 8:30, an hour and half since we got there. Our neighbors are practically done. The Server hasn't come to check in on us. My husband wants to cancel the food, but I was so hungry as we hadn't eaten all day so I said let's wait a little longer. 8:45 still no food or server in sight. I flag down another server. I tell him to please cancel our food as it has not come out hoping to catch food at another place. Even he thinks we are on our dessert and I say no, our entrees never came out. He apologizes, notifies our server. \n\nOur server comes back with the bill and says as if he did us a favor, I took the food off your bill. (Of course you did, I NEVER got it.) As he was about to put down the bill he second guesses and says I'll take some more off. Comes back and says he took off a glass of wine and asks us to give them another try. Said he was embarrassed and did put in our order and kitchen was backed up. (Reminder, our neighbor ordered after us and got their food. They actually ordered everything we ordered!)\n\nAs we sat and debated about tipping for a good 15 minutes (My husband still wanted to but I didn't feel there was any customer service to warrant a tip)  Our server comes back with a new receipt with 2 wine and 1 appetizer taken off our tab with no word. I figured decent enough gesture I paid/tipped. I'm in the restaurant industry so always try to be compassionate, but after 2 hours and leaving hungry, I was upset and surprised it was the first time I did not want to tip.\n\nSuggestions: \n1. Offer to rush the food! Get it out!\n2. A manager should have been notified and stopped by the table.\n3. Offer a voucher or gift card (even just a for a drink or $5) to ask customer to come back, not just on your word or items comped. \n\nFood:\nSeafood platter like any other cold platter. Ceviche was just ok and don't expect the shrimp to be peeled. Cocktail sauce had a nice kick to it.\nStuffed oysters were perfect. Just enough mayo mixed in with crab to top the oyster. Texture and taste was on point. Even then it could not make up the disappointment in the overall experience.", "date": "2015-11-10 20:22:25"}

So snag a bar spot as soon as one opens.\n\nOysters were big and clean tasting. It's not the sweetest I've had (Kumamoto oysters fans anyone?!) but not bad. It's good for the money, that's for sure! The pate was good - it's not strong flavored but more well rounded. The condiments it came with was a nice touch as well. Now, for the star of dinner - Shrimp and Grits. They were kind enough to split the order into two plates and I was blown away by the portion! Their grits was light, fluffy, creamy and cheesy paired with the red eye gravy plus the big shrimps - it was just glorious!! Even with the half portion it made me full. Definitely a must try dish at L\u00fcke's! \n\nAll in all, I would give this place a 4 stars and a fun experience from one of Chef John Besh's restaurants :)", "date": "2015-11-12 00:13:12"}

We started off with 2 dozen oysters, char-broiled, and an order of the Brussels sprouts (GET THEM THEY ARE SO GOOD).  Drinks were had by all, mostly wine, but I think someone had a scotch or whiskey maybe.  For meals, two of our party had the steak, I had the roast chicken, and the other person had an oyster salad.  Everyone else's meals were very good, mine was good but overly salty and the menu said it came with vegetables but there were no vegetables to be seen, just potatoes and chicken.  I was bummed that we were going to an event and couldn't take extra food home in a doggie-bag, because the chicken was great.

The crab bisque and gumbo could have been much better. The gumbo tasted more like red beans and rice than anything. Then we shared the chicken and bisquit which was the biggest disappointment.

Some things on the menu are a hit, but there are many things on the menu that are a miss....choose wisely......\n\nFOOD:\n1) Shrimp and grits:\n-On point!\n-The grits were very creamy and the shrimp was plumped.\n-The sauce was delicious, perfectly spiced!\n-If you get fries, I suggest you dip it in the sauce.\n\n2) Mussels:\n-OMG DELICIOUS!! \n-The garlic has a great kick to it, you can tell it is fresh and not the jared garlic that had been sitting around for a while.\n-They give you a lot and the herbs give it a perfect slaty garlic taste.\n-I highly suggest you take the shells and scoop up the sauce while you slurp up the mussels. So bomb!\n\n3) Gumbo:\n-Eh, had better elsewhere.\n-It wasn't as flavorful and taste bland. \n-Missing the southern spice.\n\nRAW BAR:\n4) Raw P&J oysters:\n-0.75 each! definitely worth the wait and worth getting a dozen or 2 or 3 maybe even 4. \n-Down fall..the shells are very dirty so get your napkin ready!\n-I didn't expect such a huge meaty piece for the price. I am not usually a fan of larger oysters because of the bottom feeder taste to it, but these were perfect. \n\n5) Fried oysters:\n-Can't go wrong with anything fried!\n-The batter was delicious, but a little on the thick side. Made the oysters look small, but still yummy.\n-The tarter sauce was creamy with a hint of tart. Great match for its breaded shell.\n\n6) Shrimp:\n-Was't my favorite from the raw bar, but it was easy to peal and had a good crunch to its bite.\n-They were kind of small though......\n\n7) Thursday special: Jambalaya $17 with soup or salad\n-Not a big fan of this dish. DO NOT ORDER THIS!\n-I was so disappointed with this dish. I was expecting something grand since the day before I had an amazing lunch with their mussels and shrimp and grits. Was not a great way to spend my last meal in New Orleans....such a bummer.....\n-It taste over cooked and the sausage was way to smoky and salty.\n-There wasn't as much sauce as I would like and the corn bread taste a bit stale.\n\n8) Crab Cake soup\n-Creamy delicious!!\n-LOVED the pieces of meat inside the soup. They definitely know how to deliver a cab soup with a mix of seafood worth the price!\n-Although you can get this at anytime, it was included in the daily special.\n\nSERVICE:\n-The first day I went here, we had 2 brothers (forgot their names) and they were super nice and friendly, very attentive.\n-The next day, we had this nasty waiter and ruined my experience that I had previously. He seemed very annoyed with us from the moment we sat down, not a great way to great your customers.", "date": "2015-12-14 01:53:19"}

I had the farm raised raw oysters as my appetizer; they were massive and delicious! My friend had the crispy brussel sprouts which I highly recommend; it was fantastic!  I had the mussels and frites as my meal; the sauce was a little bit more butter than I preferred but nonetheless, it was still very delicious and well cooked!

We had breakfast/brunch here and later in the day we came back for Happy Hour.\n\nBreakfast first:\n\nWe sat in the front of the house and enjoyed the French Press coffee served with heavy cream in a pewter pitcher while waiting on our food. The ambiance is very nice with parquet wood floors, tin paneled ceiling and dark wood bar providing a cool vibe.\n\nThe Shrimp & Grits was spot on, served in a cast iron dish with SSU eggs on top. The sauce had just the right bite with an excellent concentration of flavors, the shrimp were fresh and large. The Omelette of Local Crab was crazy rich with nice local greens to help even out the flavors and textures, minor glitch was that we felt it was a bit oily. The frittes were really good as well but wow; how do you finish all that food?!\n\nService was fast and friendly, we wanted for nothing.\n\nHappy Hour:\n\nWe sat in the back of the house which was quieter and gave us a view of the action taking place in the kitchen.\n\nOysters OTHS Special\nDeep Fried Oyster Special\nHalf price beer!\n\nRaw oysters were very fresh, very clean and very cold; this is what propelled L\u00fcke to the top of the NOLA Oyster Odyssey List.\n\nThe deep fried oysters were good but nothing out of the ordinary. L\u00fcke Fru, Covington, Kolsch was crisp and cold; a perfect match with the raw oysters. Our server was awesome, she made the whole experience light and fun.\n\nL\u00fcke is a little walk from the crazier parts of town but totally worth a visit; especially for their Happy Hour.\n\nCheers!", "date": "2016-01-12 22:58:30"}

Both during HH. 1st visit it was just me and my boyfriend. we were able to snag two seats at the bar and we ordered a dozen oysters. I also got a glass of wine as it was half price during HH. The oysters came out so quick it was insane. Already plated with  the oysters were horseradish and cocktail sauce. They were perfectly shucked and we slurped them down with huge smiles on our face. I knew we had to come back, just to make sure it wasn't too good to be true.\n\nSecond visit was today. We had to head to the airport but had time to kill before our flight which was during HH so got 2 dozen oysters today. We were with my boyfriends sister. She does not like oysters, but under pressure tried one and even admitted \"they are not that bad\". she ordered matzo ball soup. Again- our oysters came out extremely quick (quicker than her soup actually) just as amazingly delicious as the first visit. She did not really like her soup, but really just get the oysters.\n\nI cant say enough about this place and their amazing deals, if in NOLA make at least 1 trip to LUKE during happy hr, you will not regret it.", "date": "2016-01-18 00:48:25"}

We were disappointed that our dining experience was not as good as our first time at Luke's (both service and food). We walked into the place around 6 on a weekday, and the hostess told us we would be seated in a couple minutes, GREAT. We watched and waited. There were a good amount of tables available and we waited quite some time while we watched the other hostess chat with a fellow worker. Waited some more. 15+ minutes later when she was done talking, she came over to seat us. I believe it was the manager, who came over to apologize for the wait which was nice, since we were getting irritated. \n\nMy wine glass came with wine spilled all around the top and bottom base of the glass and dripped on me when I picked it up. The handle of the glass was also all sticky. I had to wipe it clean with my napkin. At a higher end place like Luke you would expect it to be not dripping on you but it wasn't a big enough deal to mention to the waiter. \n\nService was lacking this time around. To the 2 waiters' defense, they probably had 6 to 7 tables PLUS a big party in the party room so I know it was busy. But when you go to a place like Luke, you expect service to be a little more responsive. They probably should have had an additional designated waiter for the big party. We had empty water glasses 70% of the night and was never asked if we wanted more wine/drinks. And the 2 waiters were so busy they didn't have time to communicate with each other, so when we were helped, we were asked the same things twice in a row multiple times.\n\nThe food was just okay this time. The swordfish was dry, and the 2 burgers that our table got said they were average bar burgers. Okay but nothing special. \nThe drum fish with meuni\u00e8re sauce didn't have the sauce on it, and when I asked the waiter about the sauce I was told there was, but he would get more. I grew up eating a massive amount of seafood and I can say there wasn't even a tiny hint of lemon or butter taste to the fish. Bread pudding was okay. Chocolate dessert was the only dish that was very good. \n\nI was not a happy camper for my birthday and I think the waiter sensed it so he didn't charge us for the bread pudding and also gave us the extra chocolate dessert. It would have been great if he could have came over to say that but I understand he was very busy with all the tables. \n\nAfter our second time here, Luke was okay, but for the money and just being okay I'm not sure if it's a place we would make a point to visit in New Orleans now. I was very happy with the gesture for the dessert so because of that, if someone wanted to go back to Luke I would. Maybe next time for us it would be better to order other things like oysters.", "date": "2016-01-21 04:35:04"}

My first visit to Luke Bob was more than a little grumpy because he was hungry and air travel is so damn annoying and let's face it...he is a little jealous of you, so maybe halfway there he was like \"here's a place, let's just eat here\" or \"how much further?\" I ignored him and just kept moving. And hot damn...we found it.\n\nJohn - all of your restaurants are different, yet wonderful in their own special way. This one is more casual than others, kind of a Shrimp and Grits and Burger kind of place. It's also on the small side, so it can get crowded (and loud). Bob settles down when you put such a wonderful burger in front of him, and that makes me happy.  And the Bread Pudding...OMG the Bread Pudding is to die for. Even Bob loves you after the Bread Pudding.\n\nThis is also one of the best happy hours in NOLA. Drinks are delish, you can get me drunk for very little money except I fill my stomach with your half price apps. I met my first Yelper here - Rene D. suggested we meet for happy hour and raw oysters. Raw oysters just aren't my thing (flashback to a Friends episode where Joey stepped on one and said it was the biggest bugger he ever saw), but I've been told they're some of the best in town and she sure enjoyed them. I didn't mind sharing you with her when you walked up, cause that's what friends are for. You know, so many people make the mistake of thinking Yelp is \"just a review site\" but it's so much more than that. We are family, I got all my Yelpers and me. Don't get me going.\n\nSo just keep doing what you do best, and I'll look forward to seeing you in the Spring. You know I can't stay away.\n\nMiss L.", "date": "2016-01-29 20:44:30"}

It wasn't too difficult to get a last minute reservation and it seemed to be full of a lot of locals, which was a good sign.\n\nI couldn't decide what I wanted because I was was past the point of hungry. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes before anybody came to even fill my water glass and give me a menu, but when they finally did, I asked my server for suggestions. He seemed completely uninterested in talking to me and pushed for the Croque-madame. I should have gone with my gut, but listened to the server. While I was waiting- for what seemed like another 20 minutes before the meal even came, I asked for bread, which I saw on all the other tables. The server forgot about it, and by the time he came by to where I could ask him again, it finally came with my meal.\n\nThe sandwich itself was okay; I enjoyed the fries much more. Now it's been several years since I've had a Croque-madame, so maybe I didn't know what I was getting myself into. The sandwich was covered in what tasted like a thick bechamel sauce and broiled. In between two thick slices of bread were the ham and cheese. Oh, and let's not forget the fried egg on top. Honestly, it was so rich, I ate a quarter of it and boxed up the rest. \n\nThe service was extremely slow, the server seemed like he could care less about serving me, and the best part of my meal was the fries. I was disappointed, and wished I would have come on Monday to get the honey tabasco chicken special. Coulda, shoulda, woulda....well I'm not sure I'll be back.

Conclusion, the food and wait staff was very good and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.", "date": "2016-02-11 01:59:17"}

[ Good catholic boys can't eat meat on Ash Wednesday =) ] Well, in retrospect, I regret that decision. L\u00fcke served better oysters. They were delicious, fresh, big, and not gritty at all. ACME's oysters had so much grit. However, this is about L\u00fcke so...Be careful with the horseradish, it was really strong; you'll clear any nasal congestion by overdoing it. I also got a half-dozen order of their fried oysters which is served with some really good dipping sauce. (5 out of 5)\n\nCrab Bisque: got a cup portion because my friend and I wanted to split multiple dishes to taste the menu but don't do it guys, ordering the cup portion that is. This was so good! This creamy soup loaded with tons of shredded crab meat was my favorite of the night. Don't pass on this! Must have! (5 out of 5)\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts: I wouldn't call it crispy. UCHI in a Houston, Texas serves \"crispy\" BS and they're worth every penny. I really liked this nonetheless; they come second after UCHI's. The Marcona almonds gives a nice nutty tune throughout each bite and the Espelette honey gave it a sweetness that didn't make you feel like you were getting a sugar overload. (4 out of 5)\n\nShrimp & Grits: this has a little spicy kick to it from the jalape\u00f1os; somewhere between mild and medium on spice level. The Louisiana shrimps were meaty and tender and the grits very creamy in an andouille sauce with pieces of andouille sausages. I enjoyed it, it wasn't packing with flavor so I wouldn't say I'd order it again. (3 out of 5)\n\nBrendan's Bread Pudding: I was told this is what their known for dessert wise. Though I liked it, I can't say it was the best bread pudding. I would suggest you ask for an extra side of their pecan sauce because that's mostly where the flavor will come from.

We sat at the bar and ordered many rounds of drink until I notice that it's 3:30ish, wow our reservation time had pass and the seating are being all filled up. So I walked up to the host she said it shouldn't be anymore longer until we get seated.... Ok we had reservation and didn't even get seated until 45 mins later! Which I told myself I wouldn't let that ruin my meal.\n\nWe bumped into Happy Hour.. Yay! $.75 Raw Oysters and $1.50 Fried Oysters. The raw oysters were so fresh but it wasn't clean, I was biting into little particles of shells crumbs in my oysters and some looked dirty. The fried oysters tasted delicious and even the dip that came with it taste just right. I even ordered the Brussels Sprouts skillet, that was top notch. The seafood gumbo was okay... There was a few oysters, a few shrimp and some sausage. It was kind of bland to me. But at all it's worth the experience!!!", "date": "2016-02-24 03:25:43"}

I have eaten my share of oysters (and part of yours) in my day, and a significant percentage of them have been consumed in Louisiana, which is only notable because I've never lived there. If you like your oysters plump, briny, ice cold, well-cleaned and grit free, this is the place to go. It's even better during Happy Hour because they are only $.75 each! I have eaten my way around NO twice last year, and these are my unchallenged winners for best oysters on both visits, even though I ate at several traditional oyster houses each time. If that were not enough, they also offer fried oysters for $1 each during HH, and they are the best I have ever eaten, any time, anywhere. We eventually tried most of the items on the HH menu, and they all exceeded expectations. The specialty cocktails are outstanding, even at full price, but they are a cocktail connoisseur's best value in a city known for impeccable cocktails.\n\nIf you are like me you want great service to make it a truly great dining experience. Nicholas was our waiter, and he gave that perfect blend of friendly service and attention to detail that makes a meal into a perfect evening. He's worth asking for.", "date": "2016-02-24 04:35:32"}

The hotel staff had been wonderful the hostesses at Luke not so much. They are so rude.", "date": "2016-03-13 03:26:00"}

I was eating solo on a Sunday night, so I sat at the bar.  The vibe was great, but most of the food was poor.  I enjoyed the Salad Luke, but the market (Drumfish) fish meuniere was awful.  It was basically an oily, fried piece of fish that lacked flavor except for the heavy dose of salt - that also permeated the accompanying vegetables.  And it seemed as though the Crispy Brussels Sprouts were prepared in the same manner.  Yes, I expected them to be fried, but these were drenched in oil and doused with salt.

Our waiters, Richie & Gary, were the best! They were always attentive, accommodating, funny as hell, and super awesome! Thanks for the wonderful service & laughs! \n\nRegarding the food, it was phenomenal! The foods we shared include:\n\n-Stuffed P&J Oysters ($17 for 1/2 dozen) - Super delicious! This is a must order. \n\n-Flammenkuchen ($13) This reminded me of a flat & very crispy pizza. It was good, but not our most favorite.\n\n-Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($12) WOW! This is another must order. If brussels sprouts tasted that good, I would eat it every single day! And this is coming from a person that is not a fan of brussel sprouts.\n\n-Crabmeat Au Gratin ($19) Delicious, and tasted like cheese w/ tuna fish. When you spread this on the crispy crouton they give you, the taste was amazing!\n\n-Chappapeela Pork Schnitzel ($23) This is also another must order! One of the best schnitzels I had so far. It was tender, crispy, and nicely seasoned. Fries were delicious as well. Excellent!\n\n-Grilled Swordfish ($29) - Delicious, but nothing special about this dish.\n\n-Brendan's Bread Pudding w/ Vanilla Bean Ice Cream & Hot Buttered Pecan Sauce ($8) - WOW! This is another must order! This is the best bread pudding I have eaten. I was very sad when it was finished.\n\n-Math's Dairy Cheesecake w/ local strawberries & White Chocolate ($8) This was delicious as well. My friends liked it more than I did as I am not much of a cheesecake lover.\n\n-Steamed Chocolate w/ Chicory, Cocoa Nibs, Salted Caramel Ice Cream ($8) - This was very tasty! For big chocolate fans, you should order this.\n\nNonetheless, the foods was super delicious, atmosphere was wonderful & the staff was phenomenal! We had a wonderful time - thanks!

A Great find!\n\nI ordered the Luke burger, and my wife had a bowl of the crawfish bisque, chicken liver and rabbit pate, and a prawns & grits I believe (Sorry, I'm writing this review late and I just can't remember the name).  The Luke burger was amazing!  The bun is so soft and the burger itself was cooked just, not too juicy or dry. The right size wasn't some ridiculous amount to make it sloppy or too small to be called a slider.  I would come back every time for the burger and their fries were just as good. I'm a huge fry guy, and the ones here are very good.  Get a side order if you don't have them with your meal.  :D  My wife liked her crawfish bisque and her pate.  While she didn't rave on and on about it, she was very pleased with those two particular selections.  I'm game for trying something new...but pate is NOT MY CUP of tea!  :(  However, for those that do like pate, my wife say this was top-notched! Now as for the prawns & grits, I believe they would have been great if they weren't over salted.  But I think this might have been a mishap from the kitchen.  Because the prawns themselves were huge and grilled to perfection, just a bummer it was over seasoned.  :(\n\nThis place has amazing value for the quality in food you get!  Yes, I think I paid like over $15 for the burger, but it was worth every darn penny and I would gladly, greedily pay it again!  :D\n\nThe atmosphere was good, they had a nice dining/bar area.  Even for it being a busy Sunday, it wasn't overly stuffy, crowded, or noisy!  The decor has both dark and light features throughout, so it makes it for a nice stop if you want to go somewhere special.  \n\nThe service was great.  We had a wonderful server that knew the menu inside and out with great recommendations.  \n\nNot sure about the parking there, since it was located on a high traffic area on St Charles Ave.  We actually walked from our hotel, which was maybe 10 mins.  But like all things in that area, there is a parking lot or structure located somewhere near.  \n\nOverall, I liked this place a lot.  When I come here again, I will definitely have to venture out and try something more original than a burger.  But IF YOU HAVE TO GET A BURGER, this one isn't that bad to get!  :D", "date": "2016-03-30 19:08:14"}

Both times, we ordered the crawfish bisque because it was that good. I don't usually like creamy foods, but I fell in love with the crawfish bisque and it's perfect creaminess and smooth texture. Combined with a generous amount of peeled crawfish, the bisque was nothing short of amazing. In addition to the bisque, we also ordered two entrees off their lunch menu. I got the jumbo Louisiana shrimp en cocotte aka shrimp and grits. It is a rich dish and very flavorful. While it was good, it got overwhelming very quickly. My boyfriend ordered their special of the day which was a pork dish that came with some very tender pieces of pork. \n\nFor happy hour, we ordered a dozen oysters ($0.75 each) and half a dozen of their fried oysters.

I ordered the chicken and biscuits. It was awesome. The challenge with fried chicken is that it is easy to dry out the meat. The best fried chicken is tender and juicy in the inside while maintaining the crispy skin on the outside. In this regard, Luke is on par with all the best fried chicken I have eaten. I have also been advised to use honey on fried chicken in the past. Until Luke, I refrained from doing so. However, Luke does not leave it up to you and it puts the honey on the chicken for you. I am glad it did because it was great. I also loved the biscuit. Like the chicken, it was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outside. The portion size is not huge. I was full but not stuffed. The dish also comes with grits. It is good but I am not a grits fan.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

I had the tomato salad, he had the Luke burger and we split the steamed chocolate for dessert. The tomato salad was a fresh delight in a city of deep fried everything; the tomatoes were flavorful and not overwhelmed by the dressing, burrata or ham. The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare upon request. The fries are shoestring and made fresh, but cool quickly so dive in right away. The steamed chocolate is their signature and most unique dessert, think of a cooked pudding served with salted caramel ice cream. \n\nWaitstaff are attentive without being overbearing.

The hostess was nowhere to be seen. The bartender - or whoever she was that was cleaning the bar area - and a waiter was chatting. They saw us and neither greeted us, nor did they look for the hostess. We stood there awkwardly for 5 minutes before a CUSTOMER got up and asked us if we were waiting to be seated. When we said yes, the customer went around the other side of the bar to tell the hostess. Turns out she was enjoying her coffee and checking her phone at one end of the bar, her back to the host station.\n\nThe waiter was courteous. We had the shrimp and grits and the fried chicken with tabasco honey. The shrimp and grits were very good, but the fried chicken was a miss for me - sounds good in theory but tasted, for lack of a better word, confused in its execution. Completely subjective though.\n\nThe rest of the service was all right. Attentive waiter and we were able to get our check and leave in time to make an morning appointment elsewhere. No one thanked us or said good-bye as we left. For a classy place like Luke, there is usually more attentive service. Maybe we just experienced an off-morning, but given the price point and overall presentation of the restaurant, the service left something to be desired.

Our only problem was I made reservations on Open Table, we get there and after about a 15 minute wait at the bar, we were seated at a table for two in the back by where the waiters come in and out. My husband was not happy and after asking a couple of times we were moved to another table for two (there were several) more to the center of the restaurant.\n\nThe Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Liver Pate was wonderful and we loved all the sides that went along with it. The manager has since sent me the recipe that is used at that restaurant and also his Provence restaurant. Can't wait to try it.\n\nI have also recreated the Salad Luke. I loved the presentation of this salad. I made my own pickled yellow beets and added beets to the different layers instead of just on the bottom of the salad. \n\nThe black drum with the meunier sauce was also wonderful as was the lemon cheesecake with lemon sorbet for dessert.\n\nWe could have stopped eating after the pate but we surged on. They brought more crostini and it was just hard to quit eating the stuff.", "date": "2016-06-25 16:23:38"}

Upon being seated towards the front of the dining space on a two top next to two other couples we began trying to navigate the menu and how to narrow down all of the delicious offerings. As wise shopper should, we looked to our left and right to see what everyone had ordered and see if we should do the same.\n\nWe noticed one couple next to us had decided to share the ribeye/steak. Unfortunately they were upset about how medium rare, their medium steak turned out and called for the waiter to complain. To our immediate dismay the gentleman decided to let the waiter have it even though the wait staff immediately apologized and quickly removed the steak to make it right. After the gentleman asked for the manager my wife looked at me and quietly said, \"Do you think they are trying to get a free meal?\" I dismissed it, but was wrong as the man immediately told his date that he felt the reason the steak was undercooked and not to his liking was because... (ready for this)... he was gay. His date replied, \"Do they even know you're gay?\" My thoughts exactly. \n\nOnce the manager approached the gentleman asked to speak to him away from the table and let him have it explaining how his steak was undercooked and how somehow his sexual preference must be involved. I'll be honest, it made me sick to watch it all unfold. \n\nThe manager of course helped calm the situation and replaced his waiter with another team (by the way, it turns our his original waiter was gay too) but this man didn't care and felt the restaurant owed him something. Luke bent over backwards to help this man enjoy his dinner and in the end comp'ed his meal - entire meal, wine, steaks, etc. \n\nMy review here is to compliment the manager Derrick and the servers Gary and Tristian on how professionally they managed a challenging situation. I hated to see it all unfold especially with such circumstances, but had to tell the tale that we took home with us.\n\nIf you're looking to be treated well and enjoy a delightful meal, Luke is a excellent option. My wife and I share the burger and loved the bisque, oyster salads and special cocktails. Dessert was delightful and thanks to the amazing front house team we will return and tell others our tale while encouraging others to put Luke on your New Orleans must visit list. From all of the reviews here, I think my next visit will be during happy hour!", "date": "2016-06-28 00:39:51"}

I asked her if we had to sit at the bar because we are interested in the happy hour deal. She told me that we can sit at a table if we would like (we were seated at a table). \n\nWe ended up getting:\n\nDoor#Three, $10 prior to tax- There are 6 featured cocktails to choose from off of the happy hour menu and I am glad I went with this drink. I liked the pomegranate, lemon juice and mint flavors together. I wished my mint leave wasn't limp though that was served with the drink (sometimes presentation is part of the dining experience too). \n\nRiesling Wine By The Glass, $6 prior to tax- I didn't have any, but my husband did enjoy his white wine.\n\n1.5 dozen raw oysters, $0.75 each (prior to tax)- The price was right for these little jewels and the wait time to get these out to our table was quick. But the majority of these oysters were gritty and still had some sand in them. I think they needed to be soaked/ washed off a bit more because tasting part of the salty gritty sand is definitely not good eats. \n\n1/2 dozen fried oysters, $1.25 each (prior to tax)- I have never had fried oysters and so I thought it would be worth trying. These oysters were pretty good with the 2 different textures (crunchy and hot with the cool and creamy inside). I would order fried oysters again. \n\nComplementary bread- Just a small baguette bread per person, pretty standard but good. Liked that each piece of bread was brought out warm. \n-----------------------\n(Total= $36 After Tax)\n\nService was pretty friendly and attentive by both of our servers. We initially had a female sever and then halfway through, a male server took over. \n\nI think I would just come here for their strong drinks and fried oysters but pass on the raw oysters during happy hour (we had oysters over at St. Roch Market at the Elysian Seafood food vendor and their also have $0.75 oysters during happy hour. Their oysters were not gritty. We loved their fresh tasting oysters so much that we went twice during our NOLA vacation).", "date": "2016-06-28 03:15:42"}

However, I do not know if he was just being honest about his opinions or he was trying to rack up the bill so he'll get a higher tip, but everything our waiter recommended was at the top of the list in terms of pricing, and after we were done, like done done, he kept on pushing us to get some more food and drinks. \n\nWe had the fresh gulf drum and the Washington Parish roasted chicken for entrees. The fresh gulf drum was pan fried I believed, but it was topped off with sweet and well-seasoned veggies. Despite the veggies, the dish itself was quite bland. The roasted chicken was even more bland. Quite dry, and the veggies were less flavorful than the ones on the gulf drum. \n\nThe only reason why I am giving this place a 4 instead of a 3 star rating is because, before this review, I came here and tried the grilled pork chop and soft shell crab dish, and the food were superb.

LUKE's has the BEST BREAD PUDDING IN THE WORLD!!! In the WOOOOORLD!!  You will not regret it. You will actually fall in loooove :D The pudding was nice and candied on the top. The pecans are perfectly toasted and drizzled generously on top. Get this bread pudding with Vanilla bean ice cream. PERFECT COMBO! I ate as much as i can.

As a guest of the Hilton, I was excited to have an attached restaurant that raised expectations beyond the traditional hotel faire.  Ultimately, my expectations were not met.\n\nThe layout of the restaurant is poorly conceived - the dining area is bisected by a hotel hallway.  This is not a showstopper in terms of layout, however the positioning of the host stand at the front leaves guests that enter from the hotel side standing mid-dining room with no pointers to the host location.  Once the host stand was identified (through a query to a passing waiter), I was seated promptly the the hostess polite and courteous.\n\nWithin a very short time, my drink order was taken and I was offered bread that was relatively fresh.  My order was taken quickly, and my starter, the matzah ball soup, was delivered quickly.\n\nThe soup was well proportioned, not skimping on either the chicken or the matzah, and not falling into the over-salting trap that so many matzah ball soups fall into.  The vegetables included were fresh and appropriately cooked - neither mushy nor crisp - overall a good start.\n\nUnfortunately, the positives (on the food) ended there.  I ordered the ENTREC\u00d4TE GRILL\u00c9E ET FRITES, better known as a ribeye and fries.  There were several choices of topping, but I went with the basic MA\u00ceTRE D'H\u00d4TEL BUTTER - a good ribeye should stand on its own.  The waitress asked if I would like them to bring ketchup for my fries - I appreciated the polite reference to fries to avoid embarrassing individuals who request it for their steak itself (I politely declined the ketchup).\n\nThe steak is where things went south.  The initial appearance was appealing, with the traditional crosshatch flame pattern on top and bottom, and I was looking forward to it until I cut into it.  The steak itself was one of the worst cooked steaks I have ever eaten - it was oversalted (which is difficult to do with steak), and had clearly been sitting out - the butter failed to melt even over the course of my dining.  More importantly, the steak looks like a sandwich from the profile view - two large white bands of well-done meat with a center that was barely rare (purple-red and cool).  I guess that they average out to Medium Rare when taken together.  With a ribeye that is barely 3/4\" in thickness, this is almost difficult to do (the only way I could see being able to make this happen would be to pre-cook the steaks to Rare, then sear them quickly after they have become cold).  The chefs would have benefited from a Thermapen.  Additionally, the meat was largely flavorless.  Ribeyes are intended to have a fairly robust and dense mouthfeel, with a hearty flavor.  This steak had a limp mouthfeel with no flavor save \"salt\".  \n\nUnfortunately, the salting problem did not end with the steak.  The fries were shoestring-cut (atypical for a higher-end steak), and had way too much sea salt added.  At least the professional and attentive wait staff were kind enough to keep my drink refilled.  \n\nEspecially for the price point, I expected much higher quality.  I do not know if this is representative of all Besh restaurants, but if the kitchen staff cannot get the basics correct, I would be hesitant to order anything more complex.  I definitely recommend a pass on this one.", "date": "2016-09-15 00:04:27"}

I want to LOVE Luke. But, every time I dine here, I am beyond disappointed. My first experience, way back when, was for happy hour, and the oysters were pretty good. \n\nNow that I often stay in the area when I'm in town, Luke is one of the few restaurants within walking distance with my hopes and dreams for a decent experience still dangling on a string. I'm so determined to make it work that whenever I'm in town, I usually eat here at least once hopping that it's me, but alas, it's most definitely them...\n\nOn my most recent trip, I actually stayed at the Hilton St. Charles, and on my last night in town I was looking to not have to change into real people clothes, and instead get some food to go so I could eat in my room. I got a menu at the bar, and asked a bunch of questions. The waitress didn't know a lot of the answers, but she graciously said she'd check with the kitchen. Awesome.\n\nI wound up ordered an appetizer with shrimp and then a side of rosemary potatoes. For some reason I was really in the mood for potatoes... \n\nA little while after I paid, someone from the kitchen came up to the bar and said that they could not make the shrimp dish I ordered gluten free (even though the waitress said that the kitchen staff said they could). I was instead given the option to switch to a crab dish. Without a menu in front of me, the kitchen worker explained what the dish was. I agreed. Shrimp. Crab. I love both.\n\nThe kitchen guy went back, and then the waitress told me it would be a slight up charge. Ok... I wasn't all that happy with this, but I understood. I handed over my credit card, and she redid the order. \n\nI waited a while for the order to come out (ordered to go), and just when I was about to leave, someone from the kitchen came out and said, \"You forgot your fries.\" I didn't order fries. Apparently, they all forgot to mention that the crab dish came with fries. While this is not a terrible thing, it is pretty obnoxious that they clearly saw that I ordered potatoes, and didn't think to mention that the dish came with fries. Couldn't they have said something so I could then cancel the potato order? Or maybe they could have eliminated the fries and not up-charged me for the changed dish? The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth, and that was before I even tried the food!

Is how you stole my heart! \n\nHere's a few Luke tips to keep in mind before you arrive: \n\n1.  You need a reservation (at least on the weekends). The hostesses were not taking any walk ins. \n\n2.  The menu changes often, so do g come with your heart set on anything... Even their menu online is boy current. \n\n3. Try to get a table in the back room so you can watch the kitchen work their magic. \n\nWhat I ordered: \n\n1. Old fashioned: 4 stars because they use the good luxardo cherries. Beware they use Jim Beam if you don't ask for something else. \n\n2. Crispy Brussels sprouts with cheese and awesome sauce: 5 stars hands down best sprouts I've ever had \n\n3. Luke salad: 4 stars: tip you can order 1/2 sizes on the salads. Awesome house made buttermilk dressing and yummy yellow beets!\n\n4. Squash crepes: 2 stars ... I sent it back it was not flavors I enjoyed.. Heavy sage and thanksgiving stuffing taste. \n\n5. Jalape\u00f1o cheesy grits: 5 stars ... Best grits ever! \n\n6. Pecan bread pudding: 5 stars. We were drooling over this in the window do the chef sent one out for us... It was as amazing as it looked. \n\nDespite sending my entree back, we had a great meal. The service and food was spot on.

Finish off the happy hour hopping down the street till 8 at the Marriot. Then you will be all set for dinner back here.", "date": "2016-11-10 16:52:42"}

Came with a group of 8 and they were extremely accommodating. No wait at 4 pm! Who can beat 75 cent oysters?! Given there are places who sell em for 50cents a piece, but are they as good?? Maybe next trip. These raw oysters were definitely better than Acme. \n\nAnyway, the pate was one of best pates I've ever had. I prefer to eat it with the table bread rather than the crispy bread given with it. The fried oysters were sooo mouth watering. It was perfectly crispy and evenly battered. The quail was delicious as well! The bread pudding was okay imo. Maybe I was too full to indulge.\n\nI'm happy I got to stop by 3 of John Besh's restaurants while visiting.", "date": "2016-11-10 17:12:30"}

Just ate here for breakfast this morning after having eaten here the other night for dinner (which was our first night in New Orleans).  For dinner the other night, the service was excellent.  For breakfast this morning, somehow it was even better.  I'll start with this morning's breakfast.\n\nOur server, Jackson, was completely on top of his game.  I cannot say enough how much I appreciated not only the excellent service he provided us, but I could tell from observing him with other tables that he is an outstanding server, because I noticed other people trying to order items not really on the menu, and in each case he was extremely accommodating.  You don't always find that attitude and approach in restaurants these days.  But Jackson just offered to \"make it happen,\" as he put it himself.  That's awesome in and of itself.  In our case, we did go just a bit outside the menu but nothing too outlandish - my wife ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns, plain and simple, and that combination just didn't happen to be on the menu but Jackson was happy to oblige.\n\nFor me, the fried chicken on a biscuit with tabasco honey was terrific!  Man, that tabasco honey was great!  And so was the fried chicken, moist, and tasty.  And the biscuit itself was great, too.  And those GRITS, they are also great. Do not touch them.  Don't add butter, pepper, or salt.  Just eat them as is because they have plenty of flavor.\n\nAn outstanding breakfast at Luke.  Nice ambiance too.  And I haven't even gotten to dinner.  I must say service was excellent for dinner, and I had shrimp and grits, which was very good, but for the star of the dinner show was the happy hour oysters and shrimp.  SO fresh and delicious and you can't beat the happy hour prices.  Plus those French 75s are delicious and also on the happy hour menu!  Like is a FINE restaurant!", "date": "2016-11-24 16:45:35"}

Firstly, it took about 10 minutes for the server to arrive at our table. By that time, it was 6:03, and so happy hour prices were no longer available. Seriously. \nDrinks - GROSS. I ordered a French 75 and it came full of froth and terribly sweet. Obviously the champagne used was flat, or had been open for too long, which should have been obvious to the server and bartender based on the inch of froth in the glass. I was grossed out, but willing to overlook it initially.  \nNext, they made a huge stink about us moving our drink orders from a small bar table to a dinner table once our entire party arrived. I have done this many times, in many restaurants, and never had such a huge deal made about it! In the meantime, a woman came by multiple times to remind us that this was a \"VIP area\" and we shouldn't take up room standing at different ends of the table and talking to each other (we had a large party to celebrate a birthday). \nThe food was alright. Overpriced and unexceptional, but good, I guess. Nothing to write home about. \nWhen we divided up our check (we had a large party), it took 15 minutes for our server to return. When she did, she pointed out we had a discrepancy with our check - oops, sorry, here's how to fix it. Another 15 minutes, and she had run our cards. Half an hour to charge 6 cards? It was beyond awkward, and totally unnecessary. The woman there to apparently remind us how to behave had time to drop by during this time, just to ask us \"how was everything,\" and yet our server couldn't be bothered to run the check for 30 minutes. \nIn a city of exceptional food, please don't overpay here for decor and location, when service and quality is so severely lacking. \nWill NOT return, would not recommend!", "date": "2016-12-03 08:43:54"}

Lastly, I ordered the fried quail that had a really good balance of sweet and savory because it had a honey sauce but had a gaminess to it with the quail. The peppers were also a good garnish because they were also in the honey sauce but the whole dish was well balanced and of course the quail was cooked well and crispy. Waiters were friendly and I was pretty satisfied with my experience but the portion sizes were a bit smaller for the price which is on the upper side of $$(yelp price point).", "date": "2017-01-04 19:03:52"}

One day was with my girls. We came in without reservations and begged the hostess for a table. She told us we had to go to the bar because they were booked for the night. We did, and then were told if we could eat quickly. So we sat down and ordered about 4 dozen fried oysters and a dozen and a half raw oysters alongside 2 French 75's. We made it in time for happy hour so we decided to splurge. And yes i ordered 2 at once. If i didnt have plans to go somewhere else i would have ordered more. The oysters were all spot on. Fried to perfection and displayed in a cute frying basket. We toasted and were able to finish in 45 minutes. The next day I returned for lunch. I ordered the seafood tower, le plateau de fruits de mer, with crispy brussel sprouts and stuffed p&j oysters.  The tower came with king crab legs, stone crab legs, oysters, mussels, clams, crab ceviche, and shrimp. The presentation was so beautiful.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the ceviche or the shrimp. Everything else was great. Mussels and clams were prepared with garlic, and the shrimp seasoned with Old Bay. All eaten with a glass of wine and another French 75. The brussel sprouts were good. They had an asian flare to it, sweet and salty with a crisp. The p&j oysters were very garlicky and buttery, baked with crab meat. Melanie, our waitress was great. She sat with us to explain the menu. She was extremely knowledgeable and witty and made a few food and wine recommendations. Would I return back?

Without hesitation she mentioned Luke. \n\nI snatched one of the last Open Table lunch reservations and was on a mission to try, arguably the best shrimp and grits in the city. I took a seat at the bar and got fantastic service. Both bartenders were extremely attentive and helpful. I started with their fresh bread and also a cup of the seafood gumbo. Then, I had one of the best main courses I've had in a while!! WOW! Shrimp and grits may never be the same again. The grits were jalapeno cheese so already the plate was off to a tasty and slightly spicy start, then it was topped with huge, fresh shrimp and sausage. The sauce was plentiful and just spicy enough. I highly recommend this dish and don't know if I could order anything else here.\n\nLuke is located in the Hilton hotel on St. Charles Avenue.

Service was amazing (shoutout to Desmond and Chi they're awesome!), food was delicious, and drinks were strong. Wasn't too crowded when my boyfriend and I came at 5pm on a weekday evening, but it filled up pretty quickly soon after! You can make a reservation online through their website.\n\nHere's all you need to know about HH. It runs from 3-6pm. PJ raw oysters are 75 cents a piece... comes with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and saltines. The oysters are HUGE and so yummy (we got 3 dozen haha)!! You really get the bang for your buck.\n\nFried oysters are $1.25 each -- they cost a bit more but it is definitely worth it, trust me! Eat them right away so they don't get cold and soggy!\n\nThere's a small menu with 6 cocktails listed -- these options are half off during HH... so that's $5.50 or less per drink. They are well crafted with pretty high liquor content I'd say. The bartender really hooked it up that night!\n\ndoor#three - A vodka cocktail with pomegranate, mint, and lime. This and the Amor de Fresa were the sweeter options on the menu. They're like mojitos with vodka instead of rum.\n\nSilver Saint - Tequila with cucumber, lime, serrano pepper, and soda. Very dry, but I'd highly recommend this for tequila lovers. This was probably the strongest cocktail of the night.\n\nFrench 75 - Cognac with lemon and champagne. This was a very interesting drink, and apparently the best one around town is at Luke!! Flavors meshed very well together, very smooth.\n\nRosemary's Bourbon - Old Forester with rosemary and lemon. The rosemary flavor really stuck out surprisingly, I really liked this one! I guess it was muddled pretty well because flavors like this don't usually stand out when paired with darker liquors in my experience.\n\nWe were visiting from out of town, but will definitely be back to Luke next time we're in NOLA! Seriously the quickest, best service I've had anywhere, and the freshest raw oysters I've ever had. Probably my favorite HH spot as well :)", "date": "2017-01-13 07:48:12"}

We were brought waters pretty quickly, my SO's had something in his and they quickly replaced his water upon informing the waiter. The happy hour prices are reasonable, half off the normal price which for cocktails was $11 but not sure how much the beer was. For appetizers I ordered the Bibb lettuce salad, my SO ordered the gumbo, and they bring bread and butter out immediately. Everything was good out of the appetizers and bread, we ate every bit of it \n\nFor the entree I ordered the chicken dish with rosemary potatoes and my SO had the fried oysters, my friend had the shrimp and grits. Everything was very delicious and cooked perfectly. \n\nDuring our meal we noticed that one of the chefs put his finger in his mouth and then proceeded to handle foods with his bare hands. We thought we should probably tell someone, so we asked our waiter for the manager and a male manager came over. We informed him of what we had seen and he said okay, not seeming too concerned. He promptly walked off to go tell someone in the kitchen, \"that table over there says he put his finger in his mouth, I don't know how accurate that is but that's what they said.\" Mind you, we are witnessing all of this due to the glass, and the manager is facing us and the kitchen when he says this. I went up to said manager and inform him we just saw everything he said and that's incredibly disrespectful. We had no reason to lie about it, as we already had our meals and had eaten. I was simply concerned for whose dish that was being handled. Our waiter quickly apologizes profusely and I point out that he did nothing wrong and it's not he who should be apologizing, but the manager - to which the manager stands there and says nothing. Our waiter went to go get DeDe the head manager and she came over, addressed our concerns with poise and was extremely kind.

As others have described, fresh gulf oysters were 75 cents each and fried oysters were $1.25 while there were also drink specials going on. My cocktails were 50% off which I thought was a steal. I made friends with the shucker and got an education about the local bivalves. I appreciated his passion for his job and he was so proud of some of the local oysters that he shucked a few freebies from areas I asked about just so I could try them. I felt like I was a very welcome customer and his most important client while sitting there. I didn't get his name but tipped him well and I hope the restaurant knows that he represents them very well. I got out of there stuffed on oysters and bourbon for not a wallet-breaking amount.

It was a Wednesday night around 6:30 I think. We didn't have a reservation, and they said it might take 45 minutes-but they called me to say the table was ready in less than 30. \nWe all ordered different cocktails, and were all pleased with how yummy, complex, and balanced they were. For food we shared the Louisiana rabbit and chicken liver pate--which was rich and smooth and came with a platter of different pickles and sauces to pair with on crostini. I was afraid it might not come with much pate, but there was almost too much for the four of us to finish! When we asked for more crostini they brought out a full plate of it. More than we needed, but I'd prefer that over too little. \nFor my entree I got the shrimp and grits. The grits were creamy and smothered with cheese, the shrimp was cooked perfectly with a soft flaky texture (I think it may have been some of the best prepared shrimp I've ever had actually), and came with sausage and a sauce with creole/Cajun spices that had a rich warm flavor without being too spicy or overwhelming the other components to the dish. I was very, very impressed. It was definitely worth the $24 price tag for the entree. \nOur server was nice, although didn't refill my water as often as I would have liked (I drink a lot of water). But I have no complaints. A manager also stopped by our table to see how our meals were, which I appreciate seeing in restaurants. \nI'd return to L\u00fcke for sure next time I'm in New Orleans!

And wow - I'm so glad that I decided to check this place out!!\n\n[Service]\nMy friends and I made a reservation for 4:45pm. We had to walk from French Market, so we were twenty minutes late to our reservation. But we still had our reserved table ready. The hostess was also very polite and welcoming when we arrived. \n\n[Ambience]\nVery clean and classy! It is quite upscale so I recommend you to dress up a little when you visit this restaurant. \n\n[Food]\nLuke has a happy hour for 75 cents per P&J oyster at 3-6pm everyday! This was the main reason why I chose this restaurant for oysters. My boyfriend and I ordered 30 oysters in total. They came with horse radish, cocktail sauce, and lemons. Beware - the horse radish was a bit too strong. Oysters were really fresh and tasty! \n\n[Drinks]\nLuke also offers half price on cocktails and beers during happy hour. I got the door#3 cocktail which had vodka, pomegranate, mint, and lime. I enjoyed how refreshing the cocktail was!\n\nAll in all, I was impressed by this restaurant. Food, drinks, atmosphere, and service... they were all great, and I have nothing to complain!", "date": "2017-03-25 04:02:11"}

Shrimp & grits were good--extremely creamy and rich jalape\u00f1o grits, but far from the best I've ever had.

We've been for dinner several times and yesterday had our first brunch and it was EGGS-ceptional. (My sincere apologies. I couldn't help myself.) \n\nThe brunch is ON POINT. The menu is small and excellently curated with a billion ways to mix and match large and small plates. We opened with a French 75 and a Bloody and an order of Berliners. The French 75 was topped with a foam of what we guessed were champagne kissed egg whites and there was a cherry in there. Not the French 75 that I'm accustomed to, but delicious. The Bloody Mary was spicy and smooth and outstanding. Our waiter asked for vodka choice and we chose Titos- not that you can tell once it's added to a Bloody Mary but it was spicy and velvety. A Berliner is a German donut with no hole and usually filled and fits into the German-Franco vibe here beautifully. The basket was big and we ate three before we asked them to be packed up. There was a tangy apple butter in them, if I recall...\n\nFor the big show, my husband got the Flammenkuchen and I got the Fried Chicken Biscuit. His only critique was that some of the lardons were cut really thickly and hadn't really rendered so he has some pieces of fat that he gathered to the side. Don't mistake, he ate the whole thing. When they set down my plate the people at the next table said \"OHMYGOD.\" I offered them a seat if they wanted to come help but they stayed put. More for me!!!! And Jesus, was this thing every bit of joy. Two pieces of chicken on a biscuit drizzled with Tabasco Honey and topped with a yard egg, it took me a minute to plan my attack. (Pro tip: cut the biscuit in half, top each side with a piece of the chicken, and half the egg too. You've got two little chicken Benedicts and don't have to break out the climbing equipment to get to the top of that thing. Seriously, it's like 10\" tall on arrival.) \n\nWe got a side of the Rosemary Potatoes which is what I imagine they serve at the cafeteria in heaven and the Joe Fekete vegetables. I ate most of those with my hands. They were just amazing. \n\nWe took a small break in the middle but both cleaned our plates. Our waiter Elliot was so tickled for us that he offered complimentary coffee. It was a Nicaraguan blend and put the pep back in our step. It came with a little pewter creamer of what we suspect was not half and half but, rather, heavy cream. And maybe everyone gets the free coffee but if you're offered it, say yes. Trust me. \n\nWe were both full but not sick and even didn't really need dinner that night. But we did eat the rest of those Berliners. ;)", "date": "2017-04-03 15:55:16"}

Also, sometimes they have $5 Irish coffees (!!!) and it was one of the best irish coffees I've had. A must in NOLA.", "date": "2017-04-17 21:08:21"}

After a weekend in New Orleans with mostly \"off\" service, our Easter brunch at Luke ended our trip on the highest note possible.\nI was able to grab a last minute (literally 15 minutes in advance) reservation for a 1045 brunch.\nOur server was fantastic. She started off with some drink specials- hubs got \"the dude\" which was a White Russian with a shot of espresso & I got a mimosa. While we waited on our drinks we perused the amazing brunch options. Literally everything sounded amazing. We narrowed things down to the newly added chicken & waffles & the crawfish etouffee.\nThe chicken & waffles was delicious- a full waffle & two large pieces of boneless chicken, topped with a pepper jelly & a sweet butter. The chicken was really crisp & the combination of the two toppings gave a nice balance.\nBut the star of the meal- the crawfish etouffee- OMG. Probably one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. I am still dreaming of this dish & regret not being able to finish it. The crawfish were in season & were tasty, but the crispy rice- I'm obsessed. I have no idea how they do this, but I'm determined to find out. It was perfectly seasoned. I cannot stress how amazing this dish was (I luckily stopped halfway through to snap a pic), but order this!!", "date": "2017-04-17 23:19:45"}

The restaurant is fairly small and once you walk in, you see all of John Besh's cookbooks lined up on a table for purchase.

I love the slivers of green apples they added.\n\nCrispy crawfish etouffee: I wasn't sure what to expect, since I've never had etouffee. This dish surprised me with the texture. The waitress told us they deep fry the rice before making the dish. So it was kind of like eating a savory version of rice crispies. If you love crawfish (there were like at least 3 crawfish in every bite) and love texture, definitely order this!\n\nShrimp and grits: I've never had grits either! The first few bites were rich and creamy, but I don't think I can eat more than 5 bites. \n\nJambalaya: I hardly remember it. It was a part of their daily express lunch menu. Too bad we didn't come on a Monday, I wanted to try the tabasco fried chicken.\n\nSoft shell crab BLT: The housemade bacon made this dish!\n\nBread pudding: It was alright. A little too sweet for my taste. \n\nService was great and our waitress did an amazing job educating us about all the dishes.

Apparently, Luke, a reputable establishment near downtown NOLA, is known for its 50 cent oysters during happy hour, its wonderful variety of drinks, and its excellent take on Southern cooking. I knew I had to make time to visit this restaurant.\n\nFor those of you who are visiting NOLA and are staying near the downtown area (e.g. Sheraton, Hilton, etc. on Canal Street), Luke is very accessible on foot. It's probably a five minute walk from Canal Street. Parking can be very bad, and so I don't recommend that unless you want to pay for parking or want to wait until the evening for free parking.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to make it in time for happy hour (damn those oysters!). Luke has happy hour EVERY DAY from 3-6pm, and so if you want really cheap oysters (50 c for raw and a bit more for fried), come then. I arrived around 630 pm on a Friday night and this place was PACKED! If you are coming with a group, I recommend coming early or making a reservation. Since I was by myself, I was seated at the bar.\n\nAs mentioned, Luke is well-known for its assortment of alcoholic drinks. A lot of people come here just to party by the bar. If you are here just to drink, this is definitely the place. There's no real need to wait if you are willing to stand and the bartenders are very friendly. And if you are here to sit down and eat at a table, this is a great place for socializing. The atmosphere is wonderful and it's a fancy environment without a requirement for formal attire. Just a fair warning: it gets loud from the bar, and so this might not be the place if you want an intimate dinner. \n\nFor dinner, there was only one page of entrees to choose from (rest of the menu was devoted to drinks). Coming in, a bunch of Yelpers recommended the \u00c9touff\u00e9e and the Gumbo and so I decided to get a cup of Gumbo and one order of the Crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e (so exciting!)\n\nGumbo (10/10). Not going to lie. This was absolutely the BEST GUMBO I have ever had. The soup was so savory, there was a hint of spice that wasn't overwhelming, and I could definitely taste that bit of seafood in my soup. In addition, the pieces of sausages were tender, and the rice blended well with the soup. It was $7 for a small cup, which I thought was reasonable given how tasty it was.\n\nCrawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e (9/10). For the first few bites (probably the first half), this crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e was absolutely heaven. I've had and made my own before, but I have never tasted true southern \u00e9touff\u00e9e until now. The crawfish pieces were big and plentiful, the sauce was so delicious, and there were also strips of cheese in there to give the dish texture. Furthermore, the rice was actually crunchy too. I've actually never had this kind of rice before, but it was an awesome experience. Unfortunately, after eating half of it, I started having an aftertaste in my mouth from the sauce. It was still delicious, but I ended up not enjoying it as much as the first half. This was probably also due to the crunchiness of the rice. It was awesome at first, but I would've preferred it soft. For the price (around $25), portion size is a bit small, but overall the \u00e9touff\u00e9e was 100% worth ordering again.   \n\nOverall, I was glad that I took the time to visit Luke. The food was good (omg that Gumbo) and the atmosphere was perfect for me. Even though I sat alone at the bar with no intention to drink, the bartenders were very welcoming and nice to me. The only downside was that if you don't speak up, they might ignore you and pay attention to people who are asking for more drinks. The price is a bit steep ($42 for one person), but that's what you get for such a premium experience. If I am in the area, I will definitely pay Luke another visit. I give this place an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this.\" \n\nEat well and prosper,", "date": "2017-05-23 01:01:26"}

They don't live on the cheap side when making drinks and their food is to die for. \n\nOh and they had no problem serving a cake we had baked at a bakery for dessert, we went on the occasion of a birthday. \n\nSo yes, 5 stars.

Everything at L\u00fcke was simply spectacular!\n\nI was in town for business, and after a long day of exhibiting at the Convention Center, we knew we would need a delicious place for dinner. My colleagues were discussing where they wanted to make reservations, and as they perused all the touristy French Quarter options taking online reservations, I decided to suggest this place I had bookmarked a few months back, after seeing some fellow Yelpers' vacation foodie photos. After a little convincing that they should save the touristy place for Monday in hopes of it being less busy, and that this would be closer to our hotel, they made us a reservation for four and our plan was set!\n\nI was a little embarrassed because we arrived a few minutes after our reservation time, and one of our party had invited a fifth individual without updating the reservation. However, rather than making us wait until another large table opened up or splitting us as many restaurants would, they accommodated us within 5 minutes. I was incredibly impressed by that customer service -- wow!\n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered our beverages from a beautiful cocktail and wine list. I had a lovely St. Charles Summer: rum, pineapple, lime, toasted cardamom and Szechuan peppercorn. It was so smooth and flavorful from the cardamom, yet with a slight bite from the peppercorn. I wanted another, but decided to use some self control and savor the one I had. \n\nAlthough many of the items on the menu sounded amazing, I quickly decided on the fried quail, Brussels sprouts and a side of the jalape\u00f1o cheese grits (all small, but sharable potions, so everyone can have a taste). I was not disappointed by my decision at all! The crispy quail had a perfectly seasoned batter and then was drizzled with a sweet and spicy sauce and topped with cherry pepper rings. It was difficult for me to use proper manners among these new colleagues by using a fork and not just pick those bones clean and lick my fingers! \nThe Brussels sprouts were fantastic as well, roasted to perfection, a little caramelized on the outside, but still crispy inside. Feta cheese accompanied them nicely, and the whole table sampled them eagerly, helping me quickly empty the serving dish! \n\nAnd of course, those jalape\u00f1o cheese grits... Just wow... Melt in your mouth creamy, with just a slight zest of the peppers, topped with melted cheese that had been bubbling under the broiler... I mean, I've met very few cheesy grits I didn't like, but these definitely rank up there as best around in my book. \n\nOur servers Christopher and Zane were extremely attentive. They regularly checked on us, answered allllll the questions my cohorts had (and there were a lot), gave us plenty of time to decide, kept the beverages full as needed and just did an all around amazing job of taking care of us. I'm so glad I had heard about this gem and it will definitely be on my itinerary on future visits to NOLA!!", "date": "2017-06-20 23:49:36"}

Luke is a testament to John Besh's culinary magic in NOLA. It's next to the Hilton (across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel).  If you're in the CBD for a business conference or a visitor seeking an elegantly casual dining experience, this place is well worth a visit.  Why, you might ask? \n\nFirst, the appetizers are simply delightful. You can't go wrong with a cup of seafood gumbo or the crispy brussel sprouts (which go nicely with Abita Amber beer). I was impressed the waiter brought a card with the recipe for the crispy brussel sprouts.  Second, for main dishes, I would concur with other positive reviews for shrimp and grits (Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"en cocotte\"). Third, the service was attentive and professional. If you are fortunate to sit in the back dining room (hidden from the main reception desk), you can watch the kitchen staff briskly performing their culinary magic. Fourth, the brasserie-like atmosphere gives a casual, elegant vibe. I also liked that several John Besh cookbooks were on display in the reception area (which is a bit cramped given the proximity of the doors). \n\nAlthough I came twice for dinner at 7pm, Luke Brasserie is open for lunch and brunch as well.    Given the layout and configuration of tables in the restaurant, smaller groups (2 to 4 people) may have an easier time with reservations during peak times. The entree prices may be higher than in the French Quarter, but well worth it for the high quality of food, cleanliness, and professional service.  Luke is a superb introduction to Creole cuisine!", "date": "2017-07-01 14:04:03"}

Wait staff was very knowledgable of the menu.

They were amazing.  For an entre\u00e9, I had the roast duck with crispy rice, duck confit and grilled figs. Be warned that the duck is served very rare, which I like but some may not.  My wife had pan seared drum with roasted vegetables, almonds, brown butter and lump crabmeat.

I chose the Door#Three and my friends each got the Ruston Smash. These bad boys are dangerous since they are so tasty and easy to drink but still strong.

The portion is also HUGE, even with three girls we couldn't finish it and it was very filling. If you're going with a friend or two for cocktails and an appetizer, I would recommend this one. \n\nDinner: We had three entrees at our table... the Salad Luke, the Softshell Crab BLT and the Duck Duck Rice. I can only speak for my dish (the Duck Duck Rice) but it was so good. Keep in mind I was already very full from the Flammenkuchen but this crispy rice is seriously something I still think about a month later. It was so interesting and flavorful. The duck was cooked medium rare and very tender - to be honest I usually prefer my duck a little more cooked but it was still good.

Honestly, I enjoyed the walk, and am glad that we decided not to Uber. \n\nMenu:\nThe only reason why I am giving L\u00fcke 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their menu. Now, don't get me wrong, their food is good, but I do feel as if there menu is very very very small and limited... to the point where my friends and I almost left before we met our waiter. The menu wasn't extensive, and I found it to be a bit pricey. \n\nFood:\nNow, the part we're all interested in, THE FOOD! I'm not gonna lie, L\u00fcke knows what's up... they probably don't have a huge menu because they'd rather master a few quality dishes instead. 3 out of 4 of us started off with a cup of the Crab & Corn Bisque ($7)... along with the complimentary bread and butter... my other friend had a cup of their Seafood Gumbo \u00e1 la creole ($7) we all loved our soup, it was perfectly seasoned, and the bisque was so so creamy (however, it was basically room temperature, not hot enough, which turned us off). Next, we ordered two things to share 1) Fried Oysters (forgot the price)  2) Fried Oyster Salad ($17) THE FRIED OYSTERS ARE TO DIE FOR! Omg, best I've ever had... I wanted to drink the dipping sauce by itself lol. The salad was delicious, but the bacon it came with was very salty. \n\nStaff/Ambiance:\nL\u00fcke is what I would consider an \"intimate\" restaurant; perfect for a date. It's rather small, and the owner stands around and talks to the guests.. he was a sweetheart. I don't remember the name of our waiter, but he had blonde spiky hair and he was really amazing, he was quick and answered all of our questions. \n\nIF YOU GO, GET THE FRIED OYSTERS!!!!", "date": "2017-08-01 03:23:17"}

Word of caution, the pate is pretty big and like organ dishes, it is very rich. So if you order the pate, then maybe order a lighter entree. I had the etoufee and my husband had the soft shell crab.

The combination of heat from the jalepenos and sweet from sliced green apples gave a unique but balanced flavor- definitely going to try replicating this recipe at home. \n\nDinner: I ordered the shrimp and crab etouffee which was served over fresh homemade cavetelli. It was spicy and light and just an overall outstanding dish! My boyfriend ordered the Luke burger which was served on a fluffy golden brown biscuit with carmelized onions, bacon and cheese.

Everyone was so incredibly friendly. We were greeted with smiles and upon seating, the hostess knew our name. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very big, with multiple areas for seating, the front section has a bar, and the back area is more quiet. We were seated in the back right next to the open kitchen, where through a glass window, we saw the chefs prepare the food. We were greeted by two waiters, Jesse and Zain (I hope I spelled that right) and they were so friendly and professional. I loved the way they filled the water for the ladies first, then the gentlemen. Most people don't see those details but I caught it and was very pleasantly surprised. We were instructed through the menu and given recommendations and we loved everything they recommended!\n\nHAPPY HOUR is from 3PM-6PM which includes a deal of: $0.75 Raw Oysters and $1.25 Fried Oysters! The drinks are all half off as well, I believe. It is such a steal for such a great place. We ordered 3 dozen raw oysters, half a dozen fried. We also ordered two cocktails! We told our waiters that it was my friend's birthday, and when they presented the drinks for us, they had \"21\" written on the foam in his! It was so cute! Then, we were given our first round of food. As we were eating, they presented us with a dish and said it was on the house. I was so surprised to be treated so well! For dessert, we got a free order of bread pudding for my friend's birthday as well. They came out and sang for him, and embarrassed him just the right amount LOL\n\nThe raw oysters were served on ice and were so fresh. I wasn't expecting the fried oysters to be as good but they were amazing as well! The presentation is great for pictures as well. The brussel sprout dish was so delicious. Even if you are not a vegetable (or brussel sprout) loving person, the sauce was so good I'm positive you'll fall in love as well! The bread pudding was topped with candied pecans and a scoop or vanilla bean ice cream! It was just the right balance of creamy, crunchy, hot, and cold. I would come here just for the birthday dessert, if I could. \n\nThe service was out of this world. I have been to a variety of places on my trip here but this restaurant has got to have the best service to date. The amount of intricacy they put into serving and how friendly they are is amazing! The servers are very professional, polite, and helpful! If you ever go, ask for Jesse and Zain! They were so awesome. \n\nOur tab came out to be under $45 for 3 dozen oysters, half a dozen fried oysters, and a cocktail, which is great. I would absolutely recommend coming here if you are looking for a great experience with delicious food for an unbeatable price. It's the perfect place for birthday celebrations!

Twelve came on an order so when he brought a replacement order he only brought 10 because, \"we had eaten two.\" He watched me peel the second order which was exactly the same over cooked status except this time we noticed the shrimp hadn't been deveined. \n\nA woman we assumed was the manager came over and said she'd take them back and see what the cook could do. She brought back eight shrimp (again because we had tried to eat two more) and they were peeled, however you could tell the shell did not come off easily because some of the shrimp were a little mangled. One had a particularly large vein of poop still in it this time. \n\nWhen we were still displeased she asked me where I was from. I told her I was not from a coastal state but that my husband and I travel a lot. She said she asked because a lot of people do not realize that is the way they serve shrimp in New Orleans, not deveined. They finally comped the shrimp and we left. We still left a tip because we had eaten our soup which was good. \n\nWhen I returned to my hotel room I called my niece who was born and lived in Baton Rouge until she was a teenager. She laughed and said that is not how they serve shrimp in New Orleans -- not deveined and over cooked. And then we discussed the count down of shrimp as they returned to our table each time. That is really tacky service. \n\nThis is my fourth trip to New Orleans and the first time I have ever had a bad meal experience.", "date": "2017-10-06 04:38:51"}

Since I don't have anything to compare it to I'm not sure if his recent resignation had anything to do with our evening, but I've got to say there was a relaxed and exuberant attitude pervasive throughout the restaurant. \nWe started with a special request cocktail that slightly confounded the waiter and bartender. At first I thought, \"Uh, oh\" were in for a long and troubled night. But instead of making it a problem they made it a great learning experience and reveled in discovery something new. I think the fact that we were adventurous got our waiter Rich to really have some fun with us. We ordered small plates and large plates and everything we ordered was beyond perfection. The P & J raw oysters are some of the best in the city. Clean, briny, fresh. (The day before we were stuck in a late meeting and my companion wanted to get a plate of oysters afterwards. A friend had suggested the oyster bar at Luke but my friend wanted to go to Acme [thumbs down on that one]. After tasting the P & J's at Luke last night I'm kicking myself for missing out on another opportunity to experience these.) One of our party had ordered the oysters on the shell but they delivered the stuffed oysters instead. They didn't hesitate to fix the mistake and the waiter shucked the 1/2 dozen (+1!) himself. Oh, and the stuffed oysters were left for us to enjoy with the restaurant's compliments. Shrimp & Grits - spectacular. Perfectly cooked shrimp with perfect grits seasoned with roasted jalapeno & cheese. Other highlights were the Fried Oyster salad, Crab & Corn Bisque, and Seafood Creole Gumbo. We didn't order it, but saw the Luke Burger with duck fat fries being delivered to several other tables. If you order it, you better have an appetite. It looks like a pound or more of beef. Our friends have had it before and say it's amazing. After gorging ourselves we were unsure about dessert. Rich described them beautifully and as we hemmed and hawed he finally just offered to bring us two on him. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was far too much but we might never have known the joy of a S'mores Torte or Brendan's Bread Pudding.\nService was relaxed, attentive, and spot-on.

Happy hour prices, cute ambiance, and one of the nicest servers ever = 5 star experience.\n\nSo basically, happy hour runs like 4 to 6pm and its dirt cheap. Oysters are $.75/each (YEAH), fried oysters are $1.25/each, and drinks are half off. Are you kidding? We had 2 dozen oysters, a half dozen fried oysters, the ricotta gnocchi, and I had 2 french 75s. The oysters were MASSIVE, the fried oysters were crispy and delicious, and the gnocchi was soft and hot. I couldn't even try to complain about the French 75 - they even drew a little syrup-y heart on top of the foam. Not a single complaint from us, the food blew us away.\n\nThe inside of the place feels very lavish 90s hotel, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It was fancy, without the pretense. When we got there around 5:30pm, we had to wait for about 5 minutes to give the servers time to sit the groups they had just sat, but it wasn't a big deal. Our server (his name escapes) was a young man and was super duper sweet, knowledgeable, and just one of those individuals who loved talking to people. On top of that, our food and drinks all came out super quickly, despite the restaurant being pretty packed. The crowd drew all sorts: business men/women, young people getting after-work drinks, tourists (like ourselves) trying out some seafood.\n\nFor the amount of food and drink we had, the happy hour prices are unbeatable. Affordable, relaxed, and excellent service. I'd love to come back and try some other dishes on the menu... but I'd still need the oysters again.", "date": "2017-11-02 14:43:53"}

She was prompt and friendly and knowledgeable.  \n\nThere were four of us and we shared several dishes.  My least favorite was probably the flammenkuchen.  It was a standard flatbread.  Nothing really wowed me.  The crust wasn't that great or crispy.  The pate was quite a surprise.  I sometimes do not care for rabbit but this was really tasty.  The flavor was really wonderful as well as the accompaniments.  We had to get some jalapeno grits, which were good but not great.  I would have liked some more spice but the texture was good.

Tumultuous and trendy all in one setting.  Sadly, its management changed REGULARLY and the place just went to Hades in a hand-basket - it is now closed.  Oops...too much reminiscing of  place gone away...on to Luke, New Orleans.  Happy hour is 3-6 and they have $.75 oysters on the half-shell.  Yep, you heard me right..FRESH gulf oysters on the half-shell for a mere 3/4s of a dollar each.  So, my son and I ate 36 of those bad boys on November 21st upon arrival in the city.  I wanted to compare the \"glory days\" of Luke San Antonio with Luke New Orleans.  The oysters were scrumptious.  Literally.  They had ample bar specials and I drank two draft lagers - bartenders call - and he hit the mark.  Complimented the oysters spot-on.  My son had a Sazerac and tried the French 75 (a drink made of brandy, French champagne w/egg whites which give it a delightful froth on the top).  Some may call it a - at the expense of being called \"inappropriate\" - a girl's drink, but it is good stuff people.  Leave it for the last drink and call it dessert.  AND, if you still want to call it a drink for the fairer sex, then you can again realize why women rule the world and they just LET us think that we do.  Anyway, if in New Orleans and near Bourbon Street, go to the happy hour at Luke, suck down (or chew and swallow!!!) some oysters, have a drink or two or three at their full service bar and enjoy.  You will, I guarantee you that.  Oysters away.  Oh yeah, eat a meal there and you won't be sorry either...these folks can cook...try the shrimp and grits....a mainstay and worth the money spent.

I believe that the tables that did not hadn't yet place their order!\n\nLet me start by saying they have a phenomenal happy hour and what I mean by phenomenal is every glass of wine doesn't matter the price point from high to low is half off for happy hour in addition to $.75 oysters! You cannot beat that for an upscale restaurant! I had a fairly pricey glass(well two) of Pinot Grigio that was the cost of the house white glass and was thrilled lol \n\nOyster - 4 STARS \nI got four of the $.75 happy hour oysters and two of the smaller size oysters from Alabama unfortunately I forgot their name but I recall the price point at $2. each! The happy hour oyster were large and a mix between salty and sweet, they were pretty good but I preferred the Alabama small and sweet oysters that day they paired perfectly with my wine!\n\nBowl of gumbo - 5 STARS\nDivine! For my three day business trip I had gumbo everyday if not twice! I'm so serious! Why?! Umm, there's so many ways to try it! It was amazing here and highly recommend it!\n\nTuna tartare - 1 STAR\nBlah... the cubes of fish were hardened together by what I'm assuming as sitting in the chiller pre-molded, not saying the fish wasn't Fresh it just wasn't freshly prepared and you can tell by how the pieces hard stuck together(I do sashimi weekly) and they weren't easy to break up with a little chips that they provided! My friend doesn't like spicy and they came in a spicy sauce however didn't state anything about it being spicy of the menu. They should consider adding that.\n \nBurrata mozzarella salad - 5 STARS\nOnly tried a lil bite, was saddened my colleague didn't wish to share. Lol \n\nOyster salad - 5 STARS\nDoing a little dance right now as I reminisce on how delicious this salad was! Just something about it the thick cubes of bacon and the fried oysters mixed with fresh greens that really set my soul on fire! I've never had bacon served this way but let me tell you I am forever a fan! Gotta check out my photo! Top 10 salads I've ever had!

We initially went for happy hour, got some delicious oysters (the happy hour deal is amazing- 75cents for a raw oyster!!!). We were so impressed that we decided to get 12 more oysters and share the Flammekuchen for dinner. The oysters were all around impressive and I highly recommend this place for happy hour and snacks! The flammekuchen was slightly disappointing for us. It's originally a thin crust pizza from the Alsace region of France and that's where we first were introduced to it. We expected it to have lots of cheese and appropriate toppings. It came out mostly onion and bacon, with a very small portion of cheese sprinkled on top. The flavors were good but it was TOO much onion. We were pretty sad about it, and it definitely lost the restaurant a star. However, if you love caramelized onions and bacon, you will likely love this!\n\nOverall this space is cute, convenient, and they have great happy hour deals!

So light, not too cheesy or heavy. Good amount of crab meat.\n\nCrab and shrimp etouffee: 4 stars. Sauce was decent. Instead of rice, pasta was the base starch. It was a thick rolled pasta so the interior was sauce-free and with every bite, a plain pasta noodle would be tasted. I think I would have preferred a open macaroni or rice (so the sauce could coat more surfaces).\n\nSpiced apple glacee with rum ice cream: I loved the ice cream a lot. The spiced apple was really wonderful. The pastry holding the filling was good, but I suppose I wanted a wetter dessert so I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. 4 stars.\n\nI tried the bread pudding and it was nice. I only got a small spoonful but I'll give it 5 stars.\n\nI tried many bites of my friend's ribeye: I want to give it 6 stars out of 5! It's the reason that even though I have hangups about the etouffee and my apple dessert, I have to give Luke 5 stars. The steak was perfefctly cooked, wonderful buttery texture. But the flavor, the flavor was out of this world. It was like the steak was infused with a nice beef broth (think a fine pho soup). I didn't know beef could have such strong beefy flavor - I've never experienced that before. I would come here to eat that ribeye every day if I could.\n\nGreat french fries.\n\nThe only BAD: During the meal, there was a incredibly loud drunk man who came in and started conversing with a drunk spanish speaking family(?)/friends. The 'family' group sat at the table next to ours (each person had their own Bourbon St. fishbowl) and proceeded to yell loudly over other diners to their guy at the bar. That I didn't mind as much as other diners. HOWEVER, the man's laugh was shockingly disruptive to all conversation at our table. So loud and piercing. I've *never* before had my thoughts interrupted by the laugh of someone across the room in a crowded restaurant. He laughed at a rate about once a minute. The staff did tell the family they couldn't yell to their friend anymore after 10 minutes or so. They did nothing about the laughing man, much to my dismay. The flavor of the steak was actually good enough for me not to knock my rating of Luke down because of the atmosphere I experienced.

The food was inedible.\n\nWe arrived on time for our dinner reservation. We were hungry and excited by the really great reviews we had seen on yelp.\n\nThe hostess (we later found out manager) was cold and inattentive in welcoming us, but it sounded like she was dealing with another unhappy table, so we didn't take it personally at first. We were told to wait while our table was prepared. She ignored us for a while but did greet other guests warmly. Finally another hostess asked what was going on with our table and was told that we were standing right there waiting.\n\nWe were seated brusquely, and did not receive bread which all the other tables had. At this point we were starting to feel a bit neglected. \nWe ordered the Reveillon dinner. 5 minutes after taking our order, the waiter came back to asked us how we wanted the steak done.\n\nAt this point we figured that service was going to be bad and settled for hoping that the food would make up for it. For us, good food makes up for bad service.\n\nThe first course was a shrimp remoulade. The shrimp was fine, slightly overcooked. The main problem was that the dressing was overly spicy and incredibly sour. The dish was drenched in it. We literally couldn't eat any of the stuff at the bottom of the plate because the dressing was so strong. This was the first of a 4-course $60 meal. Presentation was a mess, like someone slapped it down with no care. And it looked like the garnish was canned mandarine orange pieces (soft and syrupy sweet). Neither of us finished the dish.\n\nThe waiter eventually came by and took away the half-eaten dish, but didn't ask if it was okay or if anything was wrong. At this point we really just didn't think that they gave a damn how we were doing.\n\nSecond course was turtle soup. It was completely overseasoned. The whole thing tasted like they dumped a bottle of italian seasoning in. We tried 2 spoonfuls and literally couldn't bring ourselves to continue eating it.\n\nAt this point I talked to the waiter, offered to pay for the meal so far, but made it clear that we did not want the rest of the meal. To their credit, the manager didn't charge us for it and apologized.\n\nMaybe they don't know how to prepare their Reveillon menu properly? Maybe the staff was flustered with dealing with the other unhappy table?\n\nIt was a very disappointing experience for us since Luke had such a good reputation. We came back on yelp and saw that other people had recently had similarly bad experiences. I really don't know what's going on, maybe they had a change of management. I really just want to warn other people. I wouldn't want them to experience the kind of disappointment that we went through.", "date": "2017-12-24 06:44:44"}

It is a hotel restaurant with a generic NOLA menu, raw seafood to steak. The cuisine tilts toward French what with rabbit pate, crab en ravigote, etc. Some dishes are served en cocotte, small cast iron deep pans, and the portions are fairly large, perfect to split. After ordering the mixed seafood platter and waiting a while we received without explanation a slightly altered variation. When we inquired we were told the kitchen had run out of one of the items, so they had upped the oysters. Had to send it back, because one of us can't eat oysters and miffed that the plate was plopped on the table without any explanation. One of the two servers who took care of our table was an absolutely clueless airhead. Luckily, we had the better one wait on us the rest of the meal.\nAs a second alternative,  we had the boiled gulf shrimp, not deveined and unpeeled. Somewhat messy to eat and the veins soiled the whole experience by making the texture somewhat gritty. The server brought us soaking wet napkins to wipe our hands. LOL. \nWe split the grilled drum and ended with a simple salad, both fairly good. \nThe kitchen is not where the restaurant is and I think the temperature of the dishes suffer for the distance, the room temp.  fish and accompanying veggies, as well as the butter emulsion, almost solidified. \nThe space is large with a handsome main dining room, a pressed tin ceiling and a dark wood bar, newspapers hanging on dowels.

The sauce is sweet and spicy along with the sliced apples to cut the heat. This shared plate is like a meal! It is truly for 2. We also had the croque monsieur with a fried egg on top. The bread was fluffy in the middle and crispy on the outside. The fries were definitely hand cut and super crispy. We also had the jumbo Louisiana shrimp en cocotte with  grits which was to die for! It's super rich but totally worth the food coma after.

Also started with the oyster platter, one of their specialties, and they were served on ice. Delicious and fresh who's excited for our main course. I ordered the steak with fries and my husband got the Luke Burger. Wanting to try everything we split our dishes and we're happy with both. The steak was tender and well seasoned and the fries came out in a little cone and were crisped to perfection with just the right amount of salt. The Luke Burger, also tender and juicy, was amazing.

Disclaimer - I'm only really reviewing this place based on their happy hour oysters, which is a shame because everyone else dining in who wasn't just doing the oysters was eating such yummy looking meals! Anyways, we got seated rather quickly, pretty much immediately, which was surprising given how full the place seemed. The interior was really nice inside, and I felt like we were dining somewhere a bit classier, but still with a chill relaxed atmosphere, if that even makes any sense.\n\nSomehow I couldn't find info on their happy hour on yelp or their website, so if I remember correctly it runs from 3pm - 6pm, although I'm not sure what on which days specifically. You can get their P & J oysters for $.75 each, which is a lot better than their usual non-happy hour price of $2 each. And I think their fried oysters are $1.25 each during happy hour.\n\nP & J gulf oysters - these were great! Very meaty, juicy, and fresh, and I especially loved the horseradish that came along with it. Somehow I don't think I've ever had horseradish with oysters before, and now it seems like such a natural sauce to add along with the customary splash of lemon. My only critique is the lack of selection of oyster type. I felt extremely limited because there was really only one type of oyster (unless you count the fried oyster) I could order during their happy hour (I think they had other oysters, but no happy hour deals on them), and indeed I only consumed the P & Js while here.\n\nRoasted jalape\u00f1o grits - had to try some grits too. They were great! The layer of gooey cheese atop the dish was pretty mild in flavor, but awesome, as it provided that comforting melted cheese texture. The jalape\u00f1os, however, didn't add too much flavor to the dish in my opinion, and I would have liked it if there was a bit more of a kick to the dish.\n\nOverall, a really nice restaurant! I feel bad giving this place a 4 because I'm almost sure I would have given this place a 5 had I come here and got other dishes besides happy hour oysters. Everyone else's food looked and smelled so delicious! But no, I was here on a mission and one mission only - happy hour oysters. And it was a pretty good deal, but just not enough variety. And for that I give this place a 4. Nonetheless, I think this place is still great, just don't come here for happy hour oysters if you seek variety in your oysters.", "date": "2018-01-10 21:49:25"}

I've always enjoyed coming here and I have to insist that the original menu and it's variations for the first few years were much better than it is now.  They're going through some changes and it's painful.  \n\nI had come here in December and had a terrible meal and the GM invited us back to try them again.  I was kinda thinking that before he wrote me that it had been my last visit.  We ate here last night and had a very good experience.  Of course, we received some special attention (the service last time wasn't good) last night was terrific.  We liked everything but the duck dish.  Even the oysters, still not nearly the best in NOLA, were decent.  \n\nI liked the burrata salad a lot, it's really well balanced and was perfectly dressed.  Miriam's Luke salad similarly so but over salted.  Still edible but over salted.  \n\nI liked her shrimp and grits a lot.  Too shrimpy for me, not my thing, but I appreciated it anyway.  She loved it.  I liked the grits and sausage.  The duck dish is too much.  Too sweet, too rich, too much rice, too salty.  It's cloying in the end.  The duck was prepared perfectly and it was delicious.  I loved the texture and preparation of the rice too.  I doubt anyone finishes this dish.  1/3rd of the rice, a little more confit and maybe a small pile of those great Brussels sprouts on the side would be perfect.  \n\nWe love their French press so we finished with some coffee and some of the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e in NOLA.  The biscotti is a complete miss.  Heavy and made by someone who doesn't have a clue.  These are easy to make, by the way.  \n\nHere's a big problem though.  It's a corporate restaurant.  Upper management here is ruining this place.  They're still serving the worst bread in NOLA, they know it, and are still serving it.  When you have people making decisions for your restaurant who don't work there and don't know anything about food you're in trouble.  It's just about the money.  It makes it impossible to create and execute a clear vision about the food your serving and why you're serving it.  How can you serve a product you know is bad and do it anyway?  Can't be 4 stars until they decide that their staff can make decisions about the food and they focus their vision about what the heck this place is supposed to be about.

We had two servers who were friendly enough, but for some reason just seemed very overwhelmed and unable to handle the tables they had. I had a bubbly to start and my husband had a beer. Both were fine but not special. I moved to a red wine for my meal, and it wasn't very good, especially not for the price point.\n\nTo start my husband got the stuffed oysters with shrimp and blue crab. They were very bready and underwhelming. The only crab to be found was small slivers. For our mains I had a shrimp, crab, and cavatelli \u00e9touff\u00e9e. I expected more of a shrimp dish with some pasta underneath, but it was more like a pasta dish with minimal seafood. The shrimp was small and tasted like typical frozen shrimp. Like the appetizer, there wasn't really any real crab meat, just small sliver here and there. The pasta was fine but felt a tad overcooked. It honestly tasted like a pasta dish I could make quickly at home. And for around $26, that's ridiculous. My husband had the jumbo Louisiana shrimp with jalape\u00f1o grits. Luckily, his shrimp were large and flavorful. But the rest of the dish fell flat. The grits had very little flavor. \n\nToward the end of our meal a very large group came into the bar, it almost seemed like a post-wedding thing. They were very rude and kept backing into not only our chairs and table, but the people around us as well. A lot of us were getting frustrated and the staff couldn't have cared less.

This is due to their inconsistency, not mine. I've had great meals here and serious fails. Dinner last night was good, as I like their brothy, tomatoey shrimp & grits with andouille sausage. I also like the L\u00fcke salad, with its distinctive horseradish dressing, but wish they'd offer a smaller, pre-dinner portion. The menu in place when this restaurant first opened years ago was firmly rooted in Alsatian cuisine, and now I feel like they've lost their focus. Happy hour oysters here are affordable, but I've had better oysters at some real dives in this city; theirs are lacking the plump juiciness that I've come to associate with P&J oysters. Perhaps they're shucking them in advance and the briny liquor is spilling out? I don't know. Specially cocktail menus usually have me vacillating with indecision, but the happy hour offerings on the current menu were not compelling. I had my usual French 75, and found it unbalanced, with too much lemon and not enough cognac. I've had this drink here more times than I care to admit, and it's usually excellent. I keep looking for the wonderful Croque Monsieur to return to the menu, but haven't seen it appear. It's winter now, and a great time to offer this decadent delight. I had Revillion dinner here in December, and didn't have one course that I enjoyed. The long and short of it is that L\u00fcke is sometimes good, sometimes not, and has less to do now with Alsatian food than it did when I opened. Great restaurants have focus and do one cuisine brilliantly. I wish L\u00fcke would.", "date": "2018-01-30 14:31:06"}

It was full of flavor and juicy. the rice was crunchy,  like rice crispy but it was savory. I had the tasso rubbed yellowfin tuna. This entree and the noise were the only reason I gave 4 stars. It just didn't work. It was  a bean stew that would've gone with a pork chop,  but not tuna. Everything else about the dinner was great!", "date": "2018-03-03 04:08:14"}

Now, I've never been a server, but I am pretty sure that is incorrect etiquette.  And as much as I have been to Luke's, all other wait staff made this guy look like a chump.  Anyway, we kept trying to warm him up by being super polite and friendly, but it was more out of annoyance than anything...\n\nFood is always consistent here.  Although, I will say that the bacon bits in my salad seemed more fresh on Sunday morning than they did on Friday night.

I was introduced to Luke by my friend Troy Black and had a terrific lunch there with him. On this trip, I had driven in from Nashville during the day and this was my dinner...\n\nStarted with a dozen oysters with 4 varieties. Six were P&J Oysters, a long-standing supplier in New Orleans. Are these the best of the New Orleans bay oysters? Probably so and they are worth seeking out. I had these last August here too (don't believe that old wives tale of not eating oysters in months without an 'r'). They were huge at that time, but it was summer, warmer water, bigger oysters, etc. still fabulous! The other three varieties were all delicious but \"crisper\" and more forward. P&J oysters are smooth, rich, and taste of the ocean. Just a wonderful, New Orleans, Gulf of Mexico oyster! Good red cocktail sauce with good balance. The Horseradish is the REAL DEAL. Searingly hot! It's a nose blower. Be cautious! But great!!\n\nFor a second course I had the agnolotti (like a small ravioli) stuffed with sweet potato, citrus fruits & almonds. Yeah that's what was on the menu. Was this the BEST pasta I ever had? Probably so and I've had some amazing pasta in Chicago, NYC and Italy.\n\nGreat service at Luke, my waiter was VERY aware of what was going on at the table without me noticing and at times in a restaurant I notice EVERYTHING. Kenny was very personable, and fun. I take notes on my phone during my visit but I try not to be too obvious. Either he figured out I was reviewing (maybe the pictures I took were the tip off-duhhh) or my sterling personality did it. Or maybe just because it's New Orleans, he comped me a huge Roady of very good Savignon Blanc (New Zealand) and a bread pudding with home made ice cream & hot buttered pecan sauce! Which I gladly took back to my room.\n\nAfter returning to my room and consuming the Sav Blanc I tried the bread pudding. WAAAAAAY better than the menu description. I've had a lot (and made) of bread pudding. The ice cream is obviously house made with vanilla bean seeds (teeny, tiny) floating in the scoop. But the bread pudding is impossibly good!! Good bread pudding is easy. This bread pudding IS IMPOSSIBLE. I'm at a loss.\n\nAfter eating all I could (and then some)... I'm in a very happy diabetic coma.

Big, plump fresh delicious oysters with cocktail sauce and fresh grated horseradish. He was in heaven. Yum!\nI had the shrimp and grits. I don't have adequate words for how much I enjoyed this dish. I've had shrimp and grits in many places and these were special. The shrimp were big and so fresh and perfectly cooked. The grits were creamy and cheesy and absolutely delicious. Savory and decadent. It was perfection! \nWe finished with the bread pudding at our servers recommendation. It was phenomenal. It was hot and sweet and gooey and delicious. I would have liked a bit more ice cream but nonetheless delicious. My picky son even enjoyed it and was digging in the corners of the bowl for every last bite.\nLuke was a phenomenal experience for us and at this price point was comparable to some of the other touristy type seafood places that can not even compare to the food quality and the creativity and execution of the meal that Luke offers through their menu. I withheld the 5th star bc we had 3 different servers throughout the meal.

We ordered a half dozen fresh and fried oysters and omg. Now I'm from Cape Cod, MA so I know oysters. I'm spoiled with fresh Wellfleet oysters on the regular. But I can see why NOLA is known for their oysters! These were massive and fresh.

So, it can be overwhelming to figure out where to go. I decided to try Luke based solely on Yelp reviews. \n\nNothing overly distinctive about the decor. But there are wait staff in white coats. I felt like (and certainly looked like) an under-dressed tourist when I walked in and saw most tables occupied. I asked if I needed a reservation, and was promptly seated in the back part of the restaurant (which adjoins the lobby of the Hilton on St. Charles). It was happy hour, so I ordered Luke's signature French 45 -- champagne and fruit juice, it was quite delicious. A waitress brought over a small baguette wrapped in a towel -- warm -- with a metal bowl of soft whipped butter. So far, so amazeballs. \n\nSadly, I am not too much of a seafood eater, so oysters are lost on me. My second waitress -- yes, I had two wait staff -- recommended shrimp and grits, with an addition of crawfish (currently in season). I also ordered a salad with buratta and grilled spring onions. The salad came with two slices of toasted bread, kale, onions and mushrooms tossed in a light vinagrette. The salad smelled heavenly and the cheese was meltingly soft and spreadable on the toasted bread. \n\nI really have no words to describe the shrimp and grits. I know that I will not have a dish like this anywhere else, ever again. Any other variation of shrimp and grits has to pale in comparison with what I ate at Luke. Smooth, cheesy, delectable grits. Huge, fresh, delicious shrimp. Butter. Chopped pieces of sausage. I didn't want it to end. There cannot be any greater compliment for a restaurant than for a patron to say they never wanted the food they served to end. The service was also top notch. \n\nThoroughly enjoyable experience and highly recommended.", "date": "2018-04-14 19:29:53"}

Presentation was great, but we were in for quite the surprise when we made our way to the lobster. Upon cracking it open, a gooey, guacamole looking green substance oozed out of the lobster. To say my friends and I were shook would be an understatement. After a quick google search (we thought this was lobster excrement) we found out that this was \"tomalley\"- the lobster body cavity that serves as the pancreas and liver of the lobster. And what we learned is .... don't eat it because it contains many toxins. Trust me, no one was planning on eating it, it was an immediate turnoff. Being that the lobster was the crown jewel of this $150 meal (yes, not a typo) we mentioned something to the manager who tried telling us that it was a \"delicacy\".... we told him we saw articles of the FDA saying not to eat this. This debacle was a big turnoff for us, especially considering that our waiter had checked on us only twice the entire time we were there (not that crowded). The manager, sensing we were not happy, offered to give us a round of drinks for free. This wasn't going to win us over but we weren't going to say no to free booze. But we should have considering we had to wait another 15 minutes for 6 beers.

The same combination of actions in a complete silence happened to my friend's plates and utensils.   Strictly out of curiosity I started looking around in order to see whether we were really abusing this place's hospitality and it turned out there were FOUR vacant tables without a 'Reserved' sign on any of them and two people by hostess' desk waiting to be seated. \nThe second wave of negativity and passive aggressive behavior was demonstrated when we requested our bill to be split between two of us -  we were frowned upon and were shown, so there are no any doubts, how annoying we were. \nThe food was pretty good though, hence one star.\n\nP.S.

It had just a hint of horseradish, not too powerful and the beets balanced everything nicely.", "date": "2018-06-09 17:15:12"}

But I really wanted to try their Shrimp and Grits based on the pictures, so my friends and I had dinner reservations here for our first real meal in New Orleans; reservations were easy to make via Opentable. \n\nShrimp and Grits ($24.00) - On the menu, it's  Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte,\" and described as \"roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausage.\" This was a touch too salty for our taste, but the flavors were good, grits were a nice consistency, and it had a good amount of plump shrimp on top. This dish was an explosion of flavors and textures, savory, meaty, perfectly cooked shrimp with some creamy grits. I really liked it. \n\nShrimp & Crawfish \"\u00c9touff\u00e9e\" ($26.00) - Heirloom tomatoes, garlic, cavatelli. Please note that this comes on a bed of cavatelli (tiny shell pasta), NOT rice as you may be used to with this dish. This was still a solid dish and we were content with the amount of seafood in the dish too. This dish was good, but we all liked the shrimp and grits more.\n\nService was friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. For a group of 3, the 2 dishes filled us up because these items do tend to be a bit heavy. Prices are a bit on the higher end, but they do use quality ingredients and  give a fair amount (a little on the small side at first glance, but it's enough). \n\nTHE SHORT: Get the shrimp and grits! Try to make it for happy hour if you can --- apparently it's $0.75 oysters and cheap drinks. Reservations can be made easily online, it gets packed. I'd definitely recommend sharing a few items so you're not too overwhelmed by all the rich flavors.", "date": "2018-06-11 18:00:05"}

Thats what makes us regulars at any place. We do not mind paying extra for great dining experience and showing appreciation for it.\nSo...\nWe went to luke for breakfast last saturday and had an amazing experience. Because of which we decided that breakfast at Luke every Saturday would be our thing as a family.\n\nUnfortunately , this Saturday it totally bombed. We have a toddler and a baby so to us the booth seat perticularly in the back out of the way and away from all other diners but close to the waiter station suites us the best.  That way we are able to better manage the kid and still enjoy dining while watching hustle and bustle of the restaurant.\n\nI called Friday and made reservations for that particular table and stressed that we absolutely need that table or we wouldnt be able to enjoy dining. Saturday mornings usually arnt that busy for them so i was assured the availability .\n\nWe get there and the table was given away. It looked like it was given away maybe 20-30 minutes before we arrived..as the people had just got their food.\n\nConsidering the kids, We had to pick a table in a spot that was very easily neglected. From there it was down the hill. We didnt  get water for atleast 15 minutes we were there. I had asked for buscuits so the kids could eat sonething while we wait for food and get busy.  They came 15-20 minutes after we asked for them.   The table never got cleared as needed. After we got the food..the waiter wasnt able to check with us if we needed anything..which we did.. and had to flag him down.  \"\nWe were definitely very annoyed since our kids were starting to get wild. \nMy husband has been on sugar free diet and made sure the waiter was informed. His food came with salad topped with \"sugarcane vinaigrette\". \nThe whole table was never cleared till the end so we had a mountain of dishes with a 1.5 year wanting to go wild with it. \n\nOk so bad day right?..it happens...it wouldnt have deterred us from coming back.\n\nMy biggest dissappointment was when the manager did not want to admit that they gave the table away by mistake and instead defended and defended with a defensive tone. We would have to pay an upcharge to book a table in a half empty reataurant? Really? Then why didnt you guys ask for my credit card when i made the reservation??\n\nJust admit..mistakea happen...the hostess made a mistake and didnt check on reservations and notes and mistakenly gave the table away. \n \nMr. Manager, we have trained in hospitality management,  worked in the restaurant industry for a long time in the past. We know restaurants and service standards. The excuses given were B.S. \nIts such a turnoff when you talk to your customers like they dont know better. \n\nThe restaurant wasnt full...there were plenty of tables available to be given away. So No you did not try \"your best\" to get us the table we needed. Your hostess made a mistake. You didnt want to admit it. \n\nFor a restaurant of this caliber, we expect better customer service \n\nFood is good not great..we mainly came here for the experience.", "date": "2018-06-17 13:47:14"}

It was mostly breadcrumb. I'm not even sure I can remember tasting any shrimp or crab in there.\n\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts (toasted almonds, Espelette honey, Progress Milk Barn cheese) - sat this one out since I don't like brussel sprouts but everyone else who tried it said it was good\n\nP\u00e2t\u00e9 of Louisiana Rabbit & Chicken Livers (perfumed with truffles, country bread croutons) - I enjoyed the crispy bread but this p\u00e2t\u00e9 was not for me. It was too buttery tasting and not enough liver flavor. I did like that they gave four different mustards and pepper jellies to try it with though.\n\nCitrus Cured Gulf Tuna Tartar (crispy shrimp chips, chili garlic vinaigrette) - there was so little tuna in there, that none of us even realized that it was the tartar. We thought it was just another spread that came with the p\u00e2t\u00e9.\n\nOn top of all of this, we each also got our own entree (although most of us were already getting full from all the appetizers by the time our entrees showed up). I had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte (roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausage) - this was pretty good. The grits were very flavorful but also very heavy. Might have been the wrong decision for a first meal after a night of drinking.

Traditional tin ceilings. Large and ornate wood trim on the bar with matching wood half-walls to break up the narrow space. Luke is inside the Hilton Hotel on St. Charles. Side note: take a look at the hotel hallway to the bathroom and nearby elevator area for its gorgeous marbled walls and flooring.\n\nWe came on a Thursday afternoon at 4:30 for happy hour. It's a great deal - all the wines by the glass, beer, specialty cocktails and well drinks are 1/2 off, and .75 raw P&J brand gulf oysters. Our oysters were large and fresh, brought with red cocktail sauce and separate horseradish. These were comparable to those found at Crescent City Brewery and other NOLA favorites. The Jalepaloma tequila cocktail was refreshing, though a bit too sweet and not enough \"picante\" (heat) for my taste.\n\nWe had been wanting to come to Luke's after we had tasted their yummy shrimp and grits at an outdoor music festival on the river. But, the shrimp and grits (\"En Cocotte\") disappointed. The shrimp almost seemed to come from frozen. They were a bit too soft. The sauce was uninspired but the grits were good with a soft texture, a bit cheesy and not dry. We prefer the shrimp dishes at Mr. B's Bistro, to be honest. On the upside, the Luke salad had big chunks of heirloom tomatoes, yellow and red beets, and shaved carrots with a light vinaigrette. Couldn't really taste the horseradish. It was fresh and delicious.\n\nOne of the unfortunate trends in today's cooking is the overuse of sweetness on vegetable dishes (and cocktails, too.) Being on a low carb lifestyle, I asked the waitress if the Brussel sprouts were overly sweet with honey. I hoped that the honey would be an accent, not the main flavor. If you're cutting down on sugar (and, yes, honey and fruits are sugars), don't order these. They're as sweet as dessert. Even my husband didn't care for them mostly because they didn't compare with the crisp, tasty sprouts at our local Brown Butter restaurant. The wait staff, though, was very accommodating and took the charge off the bill. I would add an extra star for service, but the food really was disappointing overall for a restaurant of this reputation.\n\nNot sure if we'll be back unless visitors would like to try the good deals at happy hour and see the beautiful space.", "date": "2018-07-13 15:22:53"}

Great southern charm with wood foundations and white linens...a bar is tucked away on the side as well to indulge in a few concoctions, mine being a simple mimosa to cheer on my Sunday indulgence. I wanted a traditional nawlins dish that was a little on the heavy side just because it was early! and why the heck not?! It New Orleans! I had perused the menu earlier and saw that this placed served shrimp n grits--my fav so I ventured out just to savor this dish. OMG!!! Great dish minus the eggs on top.I did try to let the dish remain as prepared, but when the eggs started running, I had to remove em! The texture of the white eggs were excellent-- not too hard and seasoned quite well, but it was the Shrimp nGrits that stole my heart! The first bite will leave you speechless! I had to savor that first bite for sure and just take it all in! I leave it there- I cant describe it enough to even make you comprehend tbe excellence at the Luke. Service was also excellent as well whereas the waiter checked on me frequenty and made me feel at home but not to pushy. Im glad I came early Sunday morning and not only had no wait but excellent service and food. I'm leaving Nawlins nice and full folks--its only right!", "date": "2018-07-15 13:28:01"}

Our table was a graveyard of raw and fried oysters.

The fried oysters were hot and crispy - do order at least half a dozen to try! I also ordered a French 75, which was not only 50% off but also a lot bigger than the French 75 from Arnaud's. \n\nWe also ordered some apps to share, too. The hot buttered crawfish and burrata tartine was super rich but super tasty. Any dish with hot butter and burrata cheese in the title has my name on it!

I made a reservation for dinner here at 5pm for a party of 10. They sat us in a private room which was a nice plus and as usual we ordered a variety of dishes to share: \n\n*Crispy Brussel Sprouts - served with toasted almonds, honey, and milk barn cheese. This was a table favorite, really crispy and flavorful. \n\n*Pate of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Livers - served with country bread croutons. I loooved this dish, the pate was so delicious and served with two types of jam and dijon mustard. \n\nBoudin Stuffed Pork Chop - served with bourbon peach glaze, grilled peaches over tomato and summer squash. Delicious glaze and the porkchop was cooked to perfection. \n\n*Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" served over roasted jalapeno cheese grits, andouille and green onion sausage. The grits were AMAZING, arguably the best grits I had on this trip.  \n\nLuke Burger - served with Allan benton's bacon (idk who or what that is), caramelized onions, tomato and cheese. Good burger (home of the good burger can I take your order?). \n\n*Shrimp Etouffee - cavatelli pasta served with shrimp etouffee, heirloom tomatoes and garlic sauce. The pasta was the perfect texture and the shrimp etouffee was creamy and delicious. \n\nTasso Rubbed Grilled Swordfish - served over a bed of fresh corn, fire roasted peppers and topped with a cilantro lime buerre blanc. I didn't get a good bite of this to leave a proper review, but most people seemed to like it. \n\nRaw Oysters - surprisingly I think I like raw oysters on the west coast are better. For New Orleans I would go with the fried oysters or specialty oysters. \n\n*Fried Oysters - this was one of the big highlights of the table as well. The oysters are fried to perfection and served with an aioli... we ordered 5 of these. \n\nNot only did we get a private room, the service was top notch and the food was so delicious. Luke staff went above and beyond and comped us 4 bottles of champagne! I have to say, this was by far my favorite experience in New Orleans and I would love to come back to eat those amazing fried oysters again. Until next time Luke!", "date": "2018-08-03 02:53:07"}

Will not be dining here again though. I will go to the tried and true, Mr. B's for their BBQ shrimp, or any other establishments that do not over salt their food.", "date": "2018-08-29 23:36:05"}

We called ahead of time to try to give a heads up that we had a large party of 17. Instead of listening to me, they gave us a number to call to speak to a caterer. I called the number, no answer, the person stated she was on limited hours on her voicemail...ok. So we show up for lunch and immediately are received by a severely ungracious hostess who looked angry we bothered to come by. It was 1 pm on a Thursday and the place was almost empty, however they acted like they couldn't accommodate us--we didn't even ask to all sit together. The hostess grabbed I guess who was supposedly the manager and he proceeded to act like we never should've showed up. Finally once they realized we weren't going anywhere they sat us. The waiter came over and had zero personality. He treated us like we were a burden. My friend ordered a dirty martini which came back literally just vodka, no olives, no vermouth. The drink was $15 and when my friend asked for olives she was ignored. Then the waiter told us he couldn't split our checks. I've never heard of that. The way he said it made it feel like he was chastising us for having a larger group who ordered separately. At this point we hadn't ordered food, so we decided to just leave--they wanted us to anyway! I've never felt so unwelcome before in a restaurant. They clearly didn't want our business. I'm not sure why this place is in business as they have zero hospitality. I would not eat here! Take your business to some place that will appreciate it.

Cadence was my lovely server and she was a delight. I was sitting near the glassed in kitchen so I could watch them work. Quite a well oiled machine. Well, I am a bacon lover and discovered that I could not stand Benton bacon. The hickory smoke was so strong it overwhelms the delicacy of the oysters and they were quite generous with it. I tried to pick it out but it was just too prevalent. So I just picked off the oysters which were fried so perfectly and ate the avocado. I never tried a bacon I didn't love until that day. The wine was nice but ridiculously pricy.\n\nWe did return for the oyster happy hour. They were just wonderful. The seafood gumbo was okay, all the veggies were cooked to death but I am unrealistically picky about gumbo. I had to take a star because while it wasn't busy, I think the bartenders were changing shifts and it took forever to get the check. Still love the oysters!", "date": "2018-09-26 12:21:49"}

Really good deals so I recommend coming for happy hour from 3-6 pm. \n\nHonestly, this was the best meal we had during our one week stay in New Orleans. Better than ACME, Nola, Oceana, etc. Everything was so good. We felt like the other restaurants had only one good meal, but with Luke's, everything was delicious!! The group felt the raw oysters were the best here over all the other restaurants we went to too. The Luke burger was really good and filling. The crispy Brussels sprouts were hands down the best- it was SO good... omg! I wish I had them in front of me right now. The Jumbo Louisiana Shimp \"En Cocotte\" was really really good too! The shrimp \u00c9touff\u00e9e was really good too but we liked the en cocotte dish better. They do have a vegetarian option- you have to ask for it though since it's not on the menu. When I asked my waiter what my vegetarian options were... he recommended mussels... so I think he might have been confused with what vegetarian meant. He asked the chef & told us that there was a vegetarian pasta that they can make. The vegetarian pasta was SO good!! Super flavorful & very filling. It was the best vegetarian option I ate compared to all the other restaurants we went to. The jalape\u00f1o grits was also really good! \n\nService was fantastic as well!

The fried oysters were incredible. The lettuce, tomato and dressing were a delight. The bacon was a unique (to me) intense combination of Smokey flavor and salt curing that I liked immensely. However, the bacon was served in large chunks that tended to overpower the rest of the salad. I would have preferred smaller pieces to reduce the Smokey bacon influence over the salad. (I would love to have this bacon in a quiche).\n\nIn all, I like what the chef is saying to me, but the management of the kitchen has room for improvement. I've read other reviews where speed of service was a complaint. I don't see this as a dining room issue, but a kitchen management problem. The delay in serving dishes (a salad for heaven's sake) would not be tolerated by most and affects the turn over of tables.

It's classic interior with white tile, loads of dark wood, and servers in white, buttoned jackets reminds you of historic New Orleans. I wandered in a little before 5 pm and sat at the crowded bar. With $.75 raw oysters and drink specials, Luke's happy hour is popular with folks in town and tourists. \n\nKnowing I'd be having dinner later, I limited myself to a half dozen of fresh bivalves and a Stigel Radler. The oysters were large and very fresh. Luke serves them with lemon, cocktail sauce, and crackers. I'd have preferred mignonette, but no one's getting picky over sauces at this price point. The bar staff was prompt and courteous, but the large TVs showing football recaps did detract from my overall experience. They seemed out of place in this restaurant.

Boyfriend and I visited every single day during their weekday happy hour for delicious $0.75 raw oysters, $1.25 fried oysters, and amazing half priced cocktails. \n\nI recommend sitting at the bar for a good view of the gentlemen shucking the fresh oysters for you. During our first visit, one of the men gave us several complimentary oysters and just placed them onto our plates, he was very sweet. All of the oysters are fat and juicy and their fried oysters are too die for. The fried ones go well with the aioli dipping sauce that they come with (for happy hour, you have to order these by the half dozen). \n\nFor cocktails, you can't go wrong with any of them. I think the most common drink that people order here is the French 75 which just tastes like a lemonade mimosa but it gets the job done. Depending on the bartender, they can make the drinks pretty damn strong which I love. \n\nOverall, if there was one place in Nola to go for happy hour oysters, I recommend choosing Luke because not only do you get amazing quality oysters for cheap but you also get fried oysters, great cocktails (compared to the sugary crap you get at other places), and your good ol' southern hospitality.", "date": "2018-12-27 00:43:00"}

She looked dead in our eyes and said, \"we don't have any seats available,\" and promptly smirked.  My friend then asked if we could put our name on a list for the next available seat... She then smirked again and said, \"ya maybe in an hour\". Conveniently she gave us a time after happy hour would be over... \n\nNot a problem though... We gave her our phone number and she said she'll call us when a table is available.  An hour later and no phone call.

It's not a cheap dish, but tasted delicious and thoughtfully made, with roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits topped with andouille & green onion sausage and a good amount of jumbo shrimp in a flavorful sauce. \n\nOther delicious highlights were the rabbit and chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 appetizer, as well as the bread pudding dessert topped with vanilla bean ice cream, hot buttered rum sauce, candied pecans (a.k.a. pure heaven in dessert form).

We ordered two dozen oysters and shared the jumbo louisiana shrimp \"en cocotte\" which had roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausage.

That was it for me, no more oysters for the rest of the night. I called over our waitress who then brought over the manager. He informed us that their oysters come fresh and that these worms are naturally found around the oyster shells, but not normally when they are plated at a restaurant. I asked if I could eat them since I could potentially have eaten one already without knowing and he said no. This worried me at the time. But I did some research online and it seems as though these worms are probably harmless. Nobody really wants to see a worm during their meal, c'mon... honestly, I just think the oysters weren't properly shucked and thoroughly cleaned before plating. \n\nI appreciated the offer for a new set of oysters. I declined, but my boyfriend agreed (not sure how or why) but was super careful eating them. They also gave us fried oysters on the house.

One dozen fried oysters ($15), 3 dozen raw oysters ($27: 75 cents apiece), Jalape\u00f1o Grits ($5), Crispy Potatoes ($5), Crawfish Bisque (bowl $10), and Bread Pudding ($9), there was nothing not to adore here.  Did it help that the Champagne was half off during happy hour as well?  At $4.50 per glass, you can bet that added to the joy.  \n\nLuke's happy hour (4-6 daily) is popular.  Arriving a bit past 4 p.m. I waited for a seat until 5 p.m., when more tables were opened up.  The wait is worth it:  75 cent Gulf Oysters and 1/2 price alcohol are worth waiting for.\n\nI love a happening atmosphere in a busy, buzzy place with decor that makes me feel special.

I'm gonna qualify this by saying that for $5 less, I could get almost as much pleasure out of a Five Guys burger or a Dave's Single at Wendy's.  Take it for what it is.  The value here is in the distinctive flavors of the burger--Emmenthal cheese, SMOKED bacon, and carmelized onions.  If you can't imagine getting $5 more flavor from a burger than at Five Guys or Wendy's, then this isn't your item.  HOWEVER, it's still worth getting a side (or starter) of the Housemade Fries, cooked in duck fat and perfectly salted.  Just make sure you get to those fries sooner rather than later.  They don't sit around very well.\n\nFried Oysters:  OMG.  So good.  We were meeting friends at Luke for dinner this week.  We're usually on time or a few minutes early, but we arrived at 5:15 for our 5:30 reservation.  No problem.  The table was ready and waiting, so my wife and I were seated early and decided to get some discounted fried oysters since it was still happy hour.  They were delicious, and the dipping sauce was a perfect complement--creamy but light, not heavy or overly buttery, a complement of flavor that didn't override or obscure the taste and texture of the oysters.\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts:  Our friends arrived and we got another starter of Crispy Sprouts.  Crispy is the correct adjective, and not burned--a wonderful texture that was rounded out with a fruity-sweet honey sauce and toasted sliced almonds.  This is happening again the next time we go.  (That's the theme of this review...\"again...next time...\")\n\nFried Oyster Salad:  This is where we lose a star.  Loved the oysters.  There wasn't a SINGLE leaf of wilted greens in the whole salad (yes, I'm that guy that rifles through his salad and tosses anything that even looks like it might have been crushed or wilted), but the bacon was too smokey for this use.  It's delicious on the burgers but not so much in the salad.  I read other reviews that said the same thing--too smokey or too much bacon (not possible)--but didn't believe them.  It's not too MUCH bacon, but there was definitely too much smoke (in total) in my salad.  That's such a devil's dilemma for me because I don't want to toss any of my blessed bacon, but there it is: too much smoke.  I (almost) ate it all, and regretted it when I was eating dessert 20 minutes later with smoke flavor still in my mouth.  I would say half the amount of bacon would be perfect, but my rule is, \"if you have to ask for changes, you should probably order something else or go somewhere else.\"\n\nCrawfish Bisque:  mmmmmmmm.  So good.  Smooth with kernels of corn for texture.  What I SHOULD have ordered was a whole bowl of this instead of only a cup on the side of the Oyster Salad.  Next time...\n\nDark Chocolate Torte:  I had a bad experience with chocolate cake as a child, so I tend to avoid it.  This was a happy exception to my rule, thanks to my wife.  It came on the plate with a ball of coconut sorbet, both of which were silky smooth on the palate, and garnished with tons of toasted sliced almonds.  The cake is small--the size of a hockey puck--so if you have \"plenty of room for dessert,\" I recommend that you NOT share this one--you could end up like Gollum when there's two spoons going for the last bite:  \"That's MY PRECIOUS!!\"\n\nBon Appetit!", "date": "2019-05-12 21:35:07"}

We ordered a dozen of the P&J Raw Oysters at 75c each, 6 lightly fried Oysters and the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" with roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille and green onion sausage. All of these meals were shared between the two of us and the waiter was nice enough to have the Louisiana Shrimp dish plated into two individual servings as it's very filling. Overall we had a great dining experience at Luke, the atmosphere and service was fantastic also great value and very impressive food.", "date": "2019-05-29 20:27:14"}

Upon sitting, I see a waiter bring around some of the biggest and fattest oysters I have ever seen in my life. When he came to our table, he explained which oysters were on the happy hour menu and that they were only 75 cents! My mind was still in awe on the huge oysters so I asked him what types of oysters those were. He told me those were the on the happy hour menu and I knew right away I was going to like this place.\n\nMy party of four ordered 3 dozens and were patiently waiting as they were getting shucked. We were able to see the chefs shuck them from our table which made the food more appealing. They came out pretty quickly and they were finished just as quicked. My group devoured these oysters. They were amazing! The first oysters I have the area were amazing and set the standard very high. They were so juicy and creamy. Also for 75 cents is a price you cannot beat.

Hmmmm it was tasteless and room temperature. I didn't know what to expect but I thought it would come out piping hot. I asked the server and she took it back to reheat the dish. Well instead of room temperature it was warm. At least they tried. The gumbo was thick. Thick like slime. One bite and I was done. The stuffed oysters were recommended so I was very excited to try. But man I was disappointed! It had so flavor whatsoever and what made it worse was the texture. Just a bunch of mush in my mouth. $14 for four oysters. I ate one and my bf ate one.

He was super nice about both requests.\n\nMy grits came out a few minutes later (fresh cast iron dish) and they were bubbling over, nice and hot. I wasn't given a new plate or utensils, one I got these I was able to DIG in! They did not disappoint! The chef came over to make sure they were hot enough and I assured him they were amazing. My only regret is I didn't try the tasty French bread I was offered and declined.\n\nDuring my dining experience I noted my server standing in the back corner chatting with co-workers and laughing. He was very nice, not the most attentive but very nice.\n\nThe table next to me ordered a burger and it was so huge they so huge they spilt it.

Should you wish to have some amazing food to accompany this superior service, I would highly recommend the boudin balls, the fresh oysters, the shrimp and jalape\u00f1o grits, the fresh fish...if your mouth isn't watering yet, it should be! All of the food at Luke was delicious. A must-go when visiting New Orleans!", "date": "2019-08-09 11:28:27"}

We came here specifically for their 75 cent oyster happy hour. I'm not a fan of raw oysters myself, but my mom absolutely loved the oysters at Luke. Juicy, sweet, super clean, and big! The service was also impeccable as well. I came back to New Orleans in August 2019 and my mom and I decided to bring the rest of our family here since our first visit was so amazing. Big mistake! \n\nNow, I know August isn't the prime time to eat raw oysters, but we went ahead and ordered a half dozen anyway. Our waitress brought a platter of NINE oysters that were DARK BROWN and looked SHRIVELED. I wish I had taken a picture. It was super unappetizing to look at it. Now, there's two things here that I don't understand: 1) How did the guy shucking oysters behind the bar think it was okay to send that out? 2) How did the waitress think it was okay to serve that? Clearly, no one was paying any attention at all to their jobs... Never mind the fact that the oysters were terribly dark and dried out, but there were 9. You can't even order that amount (has to be in half-dozen increments only). \n\nWanting to be polite, we immediately flagged down our waitress and pointed out that we had ordered 6 (we didn't mention the dark discoloration). She looked at it, and realized that indeed, there were 9 instead of 6 oysters, maybe to make up for the fact that \"some of them were small.\" She then noted that hey, these oysters are sort of dark. (An understatement, but at least she addressed it.) She apologized and took the platter of oysters away, proceeding to consult with management about what to do. She ended up bringing out new oysters that were a little more decent. Now, we had also ordered a half-dozen of fried oysters... when these came out in a little fry basket, we realized that there were definitely more than 6. YUP, there were 9. Those 9 funky, gross oysters that were at our table earlier? Those just got fried and served right back to us. Not professional. You would think a nice restaurant like this wouldn't resort to cutting corners. \n\nThat whole experience with the oysters soured our experience for the rest of the meal. Our Luke burger, which we ordered medium-rare, came out well-done. A waitress accidentally dropped a used fork on my brother's lap. On a positive note, the brussels sprouts were as good as I remembered it though. We also tried the fig flatbread & that was delicious as well.\n\nOverall, a really disappointing experience, especially after looking forward to my return trip to Luke.", "date": "2019-08-14 23:55:29"}

I actually really enjoyed these and would totally order them again here. I think having a \"first\" experience and it going this well always sets the right tone for a meal. \n\nWe shared the most amazing bisque soup I think I've ever had which makes enjoying turtle soup and gumbo in this city nearly feel like they are only second best to Luke's bisque. \n\nThen it was onto the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" shrimp and grits dish and our incredible server brought the heartiest of samplers of their Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp & Crab \"\u00c9touff\u00e9e\" when we couldn't decide on which entree to share. \n\nAfter our dining experience the night prior and totally over ordering our server was the absolute best and understood we wanted to pace ourselves and be able to enjoy meal after meal during this trip without wasting things or having to bring meals back to our hotel fridge to sit in styrofoam. \n\nHe steered us to the best dish to order being the shrimp and grits which is the absolute most correct answer. This dish is mind blowing with flavor in each and every single bite. The etouffee is also amazing, less flavor I'd say but the cripsy rice is one of those things you just need to experience, very yummy! \n\nWe shared the Carrot Cake blondie sundae with cream cheese ice cream, butterscotch whiskey sauce and candied carrots, nice finishing touch to the meal. \n\nThe service and atmosphere was perfection, really exactly what you'd want for a nice dinner out in New Orleans and even if you're a local I can see this being a great go-to option for the most yummy meal. I think what was most shocking in the very best way, was the bill... this meal was outstanding and other than us ordering a bottle of wine that cost nearly as much as our meal the price point is so reasonable for such amazing quality and service. \n\nCannot wait to return and will surely recommend to anyone looking for one of the best meals in New Orleans.

We were taking a long walk and were deciding between Luke and Tressane (or however else it's spelled), and we're so glad the coin flip led us here.\n\nWe started off with the duck/rabbit pate and the fried boudin balls. To be honest, I still have absolutely zero idea what boudin is. Sometimes it'll be like pulled pork, other times a patty, and here it was like a fried hushpuppy or arancini, but regardless, it was still delicious! Not sure what the yellow sauce was that came with it (it was foamy and tasted like butter and mellowed out hollandaise sauce), but the sauce helped add another level to the boudin balls.\n\nThe pate was to die for. They brought out a giant jar of the stuff along with a full board of large-grain mustard, pickles, a pickled radish or some other vegetable, and two types of vegetable jams. When we ran out of crostinis (the jar is HUGE people) our waiter brought us some more bread. The pate is rich and has the lovely iron-like flavor you would find in liver dishes. Combined with the acidic and sweet flavors of the rest of the board, the pate was perfect. I would strongly recommend it, as long as you don't absolutely despise liver.\n\nFor our main course, we ordered the shrimp and grits to share, and the kitchen graciously divided the dish into two small skillets (thank god, otherwise I know my wife would have eaten more than her fair share of the plate). The shrimp were juicy, the sausages moist and full of flavor, and the grits cheesy and just bland enough balance out the strong vegetable stew/sauce that coated everything. It really was a well balanced dish and the portions were huge! I felt full even after eating just my half of the dish.\n\nAnd holyyyyy cow, the bread pudding and ice cream was FANTASTIC. Probably the best part of the meal. The bread pudding is soaked in a whiskey caramel which, you'd think would be saccharine, but it was just the perfect level of sweet. If I wasn't in public, I would have licked that bowl clean.", "date": "2019-08-16 20:54:37"}

They reheated it for me as the first time it was just barely warm. But I've had a better version at bonefish grill of all places. \n\nMy entree was their drum fish. I ordered it almondine.

Happy hour.\n\nBut not just any happy hour. Of course, the usual beer, wine, and cocktails were available for half off from 3-6pm. But the star attraction is that they also sell their local P&J oysters on the half shell for just 75 cents each during happy hour.\n\nSo the 3 dozen oysters (yes, that's right -- 3 dozen, 36) my wife and I ordered to share that would have cost us more than $100 back home in San Diego, cost just $27 during happy hour. They were fresh and meaty. Being local, they weren't briny like the ones you would typically get from the Pacific Northwest or New England but they were tasty nonetheless.\n\nMy wife had a glass of Malbec to go along with the oysters and I had a local IPA. Both excellent. The server also brought us a warm baguette with soft butter. Perfect.\n\nWe liked the Luke happy hour so much we came back on our last full day in New Orleans. This time we scaled back to 2 dozen oysters and tried the cheesy grits (AMAZING) and fried potatoes (crispy and very good).\n\nVery glad we followed the recommendation of our Lyft driver!

We ended up consuming 2.5 dozen.\n\nWe also ordered the pate of louisiana rabbit/chicken livers. Sounds a little adventurous but don't shy away...pate is delicious. The portions were incredibly generous, the pate was placed in jar and served with crostini and a multitude of other toppings like a grainy mustard, chutney/jam?, pickled veggies, etc. Tasting each toppings individually was quite strange. However, once you put the pate on the crostini and pick your topping and eat it all together -- that's where the MAGIC happens. Wow, just incredible how well the flavors all somehow worked together. Don't be shy in asking for more crostinis because what it comes with isn't enough for the amount of pate they serve with. We shared this amongst 2 people but I feel it is more than enough for 6 people.  \n\nOur server was just the right amount of attentive and our overall experience was very good.

But I could see the place was packed and the food looked delicious so I asked if I could wait for a seat at the bar. \nI often find eating at the bar a doorway to an excellent meal, as the bartender, wait staff and patron usually are spot on in their recommendations. Luke was no exception. The bartender steered me towards the Gulf Puppy Drum but recommended I order it \"poor and dirty\" - blackened. The patron next to me said the jalapeno cheese grits were to die for...so I did both.  The grits came in their own little cast iron skillet and were surrounded in a crispy coating on the bottom and luscious cheese on top. A meal in and of itself. Not to be outdone, the drum fish was perfectly blackened and served over a bed of roasted root veggies. Holy cow was this dish an explosion of flavor.  I was so overjoyed that I let anyone within earshot hear my satisfaction, over and over again. The menu suggests lump crab on top of the drum, but frankly I think it would have overpowered the taste of this impeccably prepared gulf fish. I was too stuffed for the bread pudding, which looked scrumptious!\nI know where I will be dining on my next trip to New Orleans...Luke.", "date": "2020-02-07 00:27:12"}

We made OpenTable reservations upon the recommendation of two friends who had recommended Luke for their burgers, as we continued our quest for the best in the city. \n\nTanya warmly greeted us from behind her mask, promptly showed us to our table, and occasionally checked to make sure that their quality standards were being maintained. Jesse quickly filled our water glasses, answered our menu questions, took our orders, and kept the experience moving right along without making us feel rushed. Gary arrived with our entr\u00e9es soon after we finished our boiled and chilled and succulent--as well as really jumbo--Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp, served with delightful remoulade and shrimp cocktail sauces. Our friends had not misled us.\n\nMy wife's medium-ordered Luke Burger was served with a nice outside char and pink inside. The Swiss had beautifully melted, and because of the thickly sliced bacon, caramelized onions, tomato slice and crisp lettuce, there was no need for mayo, ketchup (the cute little bottle of which we used for dipping the fries--which were crispy on the exterior, with a lovely, flavorful, inside chew), or mustard. The burger was juicy without being greasy. While in the restaurant, our exuberance resulted in declaring it the finest burger in New Orleans; however, on further (unemotional) reflection, we agree that it is at least in the top three of the twenty or so different hamburgers ordered from as many different restaurants and caf\u00e9s, out of the 88 at which we've eaten in the last 3.5 years. Congratulations, Luke, and we will be sure to let you know where you stand after we have retested the current standings in the NOLA burger trinity!\n\nAlso consumed was the Louisiana Blue Crab Garganelli, with saffron cream, creole tomatoes, wild mushrooms, chili, and parmesan, and I *do* mean consumed, as in almost inhaled. Al dente was the pasta, and the entire dish was exquisite. Upon our future returns, if we both order burgers, I'll also have to get the Blue Crab Garganelli to go--it's that good.\n\nWe are closing in on the end of this review, so here are a few words about our shared dessert, Brendan's Bread Pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce.

Rich was also able to accommodate my needs for not being able to decide between two entrees & giving me a half order of each which made it perfect. Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp & Grits & Louisiana Blue Crab Garganelli. Both full of flavor & the best of both worlds.

That's fine, I've worked in the business many years as well, we knew this was the lunch rush and we were taking a chance, no big whoop.  But this manager kept almost like scolding us that we didn't have a reservation and kept repeating that we should have made a reservation.  Like, we heard it at least 10 times while we stood there because I was talking to a lifelong friend of mine who is a serve who I just hadn't seen in a moment.  And the manager was like \"aw, you know him, yeah, I could've sat you in his section had you requested that when you MADE A RESERVATION, but you didn't make a reservation\".  \n\nWe'll be back, because the place is still great if not for that one weird thing with the manager.", "date": "2020-06-14 20:54:13"}

The food, the staff and the ambiance were all great. \n\n1/2 of the tables were empty as they adhered to social distancing for all guests. They had signs advising that masks were required for entry & masks/gloves were required for staff. \n\nWe ordered the spinach & crab artichoke dip w/grilled bread for the appetizer and it was so deliciously creamy. There were chunks of artichoke with a nice melted layer on top of the cast iron dish that it's served in. We also ordered fried oysters. They were piping hot & served in a mini deep fryer basket. Admittedly, I am not a huge oyster fan, but wanted to try new dishes on vacation. They were seasoned well and tasted like fried liver to me, so it you're into that, they will be great. My partner loved them. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the Bacon Avocado salad w/grilled shrimp & it was oh so good. The bacon \"bits\" were huge and tasted great. They were a bit salty, so I opted not to eat as many when I reordered the salad (I ordered this 3x while we were in town). \n\nMy partner ordered the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp & Grits & it was great as well. He's typically a heavy eater and wasn't able to finish his dish. \n\nThey had a nice Pinot Noir (I don't remember the brand) that was great. Sweet, but semi dry. We were told that happy hour was closing & ordered 2 glasses of bourbon to wrap up our meal. \n\nThe only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the table near us found a bug on the wall during our meal. The staff addressed it immediately & appeared to be very attentive to the couple who was disturbed by their uninvited guest. However, even they said, \"you're lucky the food was so damn good.\" It really appeared to be an isolated incident & the staff seemed to take every necessary precaution in the reopening since COVID. \n\nBecause they are directly across from our hotel (The Intercontinental), Luke was our go to for the entirety of our stay.

These were some of the freshest oysters we've ever had and you could taste the ocean in every bite.\n\nNext we had the tuna tartare are.

Just enough heat to add to the overall dish.\n\nMy sexy hot wife ordered the oxtail which came over a bed of homemade egg noodles, wild mushrooms and with crispy kale mixed in for texture.

One server came to pour water only, gave a short greeting and that was it. But, I was surprised to hear him introduce himself to the table of three men sitting next to me.

So we went. The menu is extremely limited. We were joking about how extensive it was. After reviewing the menu, my brother said he was going to order French fries(everything had French fries) and pudding! We asked our waiter if there were any specials to which he retorted, what you see is what you get. My husband ordered local oysters, which were billed as being large. Some were no bigger than a Nickel (okay less than a quarter but larger than a nickel) my sister in law ordered the PJ bbq oysters. There were four for $17. Pricey and you could not taste the oysters. I ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts. The saving grace was the honey drizzled on them. We all had drinks with our dinner. I ordered pork schnitzel ( menu had about five entrees and this was one)\nRather odd for a city known for Cajun food and seafood but nothing else looked interesting. The schnitzel was huge(two big pieces). Everything had French fries, which, I had no desire to have for dinner. I exchanged them for the cauliflower. This was barely warmed. The \"mushroom gravey\" came in a tiny container and was cold. My sister in law ordered the shrimp and grits. The sauce was thick, salty and obscured the taste of the shrimp.Our waiter filled water glasses but never asked how the meal was. He had words with (we assume), was the manager informing him he would not take any more tables to which the manager said that's fine because we are closed. Not something that helps digestion. We ordered another round of drinks. After a long enough period of time that the men in our group were going to cancel the order, a server(not ours) brought the men's drinks but not my wine. I asked if my wine was coming and the answer was no because they ran out of clean glasses! Now, most restaurants would have poured the wine into any acceptable container, brought it to the table and ask if I minded the same glass, explaining the situation. This young lady did not. I gave her my glass so they could \"wash it\" for future customers. She then asked if I wanted some wine in that glass. Too late not interested and done with the dismal dinner experience. Oh yeah, I forgot about boxing my meal. The manage boxed my meal. I asked to have the schnitzel and cauliflower boxed but not the gravy. He asked if I wanted new cauliflower. I said no just what I had. He boxed only my schnitzel and nothing else. I had to ask for cauliflower. For this wonderful meal, we paid 88 dollars before the  tip ( and yes, in spite of a bad experience, we still tipped the waiter)", "date": "2021-04-01 14:56:16"}

After some yelp searching, we decided to check out Luke.  I will say, I would give more of a 3.5 stars than 3 but overall, we would most likely not go back but wouldn't be mad if we had to go back.  \n\nService - was hit and miss.  We didn't have one server, but anyone in a white coat could be our server.  Because of this it took a while for someone to take our order and check on as at moments.  We did have one server who I got the attention of that we were ready to order and then he didn't come back to check on us so we had to find another server to help.  The other servers were very friendly and attentive  but it was hard to tell who to go to when we needed something.  \n\nCocktails - were delicious!  and bartender was attentive\n\nFood - the four of us split the grits and brussels sprouts - both very good!  Two of us got burgers, unfortunately very very salty.  One of us got the pasta oxtail ragu -  good, very heavy and filling.  One of us got the mussels - a big bowl of tons of smaller mussels - good.  We also started with a few raw oysters and they were yummmmy.  Overall the food was good but not outstanding or super unique.  \n\nAtmosphere - a tad disappointing.  I thought it would be kind of a cool atmosphere for a little double date but the place was filled with tourists and families dressed very casually in t-shirts and shorts.  I felt like I expected too much coming into it.\n\nOverall I would say a great place if you're a tourist staying downtown and want a solid place to eat without having to dress too fancy.  I would not suggest it as a \"special\" place if you're a local, but that's how I'm learning now that I moved here!", "date": "2021-04-08 17:07:27"}

Both hostesses asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, but there were plenty of open seats. We were seated and waited at least 5 minutes to be greeted (mind you, there were a total of 4 parties, all less than 4 in the house). We were greeted by the busser, who later brought us water. We then waited another 5 minutes for our server. We ordered coffee and our meals, and waited another few minutes for our cold coffee to arrive. I ordered the buttermilk biscuits and the shrimp and grits, my hubs got 1/2 dozen oysters, and the croque madame. The biscuits were super disappointing. They arrived cold. (Insert shocked, sad, and disappointed face.) What good is pecan butter, if it doesn't melt when you put it on your biscuit?!?! I also asked for the strawberry preserves. Instead, lemon curd was brought to the table, it was not great all. It tasted like an ingredient, not a biscuit accoutrement. The server did eventually bring the strawberry preserves; they were good, but again, not really interested in any cold biscuit no matter what gets smeared on it. My husband said his oysters were decent. His sandwich came with fries, of course no ketchup was brought to the table. The sandwich was very average and warm but not hot. The sauce on top actually was very thick and seemed like more flour than anything else. The shrimp and grits had a lot of flavor, but again the meal was \"luke\" warm when it arrived at the table and it contained 4 medium-sized shrimp, and an extra tail with no shrimp attached, and a shit ton of sausage. It was flavorful, but the sauce to grits ratio was way off and again, why was it not hot?!?

We had had a pre-dinner beforehand and we weren't too hungry for a whole entree so decided to each get a gumbo bowl and then split the crawfish flatbread. The gumbo was very solid - very comforting and warm and satisfying. Great rich flavor. The flatbread was so good. The tomatoes had a fantastic flavor, sweet and savory and richer than any normal tomatoes. And the texture of the bread was perfectly crispy. Would definitely recommend getting this for an appetizer. We capped off with the bread pudding for desert which was phenomenal. The vanilla ice cream and the candied pecans were nice elevated touches but the real stand out is the buttered rum sauce.

Having said that, I'm not above a fair critique of Luke. \n\nI can only get so many food opportunities in when we're in town so Luke has been on my bucket list for a while, waiting for the right time. On this stay, it was a short walk from where we were lodging and convenient for dinner after we got checked in. At 6:00 on a Wednesday evening the place was busy but not completely packed and we were seated promptly. The interior is beautifully comfortable, very French bistro-esque with charming black and white vintage tiles and gorgeous woodwork at the bar. Watching the staff was an exercise in fine dining perfection. The front-of-the-house manager and head waiter (I'm guessing) worked the floor with precision while also tending tables when needed as well as discretely guiding new staff on points of detail not to be overlooked. White-jacketed serving staff were welcoming, energetic, and polite and add to the posh old-school ambiance. \nIn our particular experience this evening, there were just a few downsides. Despite amble wait staff, service to our table-for-two was fairly slow. It took a good 10 minutes or so to get our initial drinks after a bit of a wait for someone to bring water and take our drink order, explaining that So-and-so would be our server but he'd go ahead and get our drinks. Then another stretch of time before the (same) server came around so that we could place our smoked trout dip order, another stretch to place our entree order (same server), and another good wait before  my empty wine glass was noticed by the head waiter(?) and asked if I care for another. The trout dip was delish while just a tad over-salted, however to my hub it was perfectly fine. I usually ask him to weigh in to make sure as my tastes can be sensitive when it comes to saltiness; what is often very salty to me is well-balanced to others. It may due to back down on the salt to allow the diner to adjust at table, but I'm not going to be too critical here - overall, the dip rocked. The crackers served with were absolutely tasty all on their own and complimented the dip perfectly. \nFor entrees, hubs ordered shrimp and grits and I went for the schnitzel. The S/G were very flavorful and decadent, however the amount of cheese used in the dish, while being a big selling point I'm sure, was absolute overkill imho and threw the balance off. Moderation on the cheese factor would make this dish outstanding. The gratin portion size is perfect for such a rich dish. My schnitzel leaned toward disappointment. While the flavor was very tasty, the pork juicy, and the breading substantial and nicely crisp, it was a bit over-browned and came sans a sauce/gravy of any kind giving it a dryness that a drizzle of a nice anything besides merely the juice of the grilled lemon half garnish would have improved. It comes served with a healthy portion of standard frozen thin-cut fries, another let down. Some good fresh cut side fries and a delectable sauce for the cutlets would make this dish shine. \nAll-in-all I was almost in tears for finally getting to dine here and relished the fact that the slower service allowed me the time to take in the atmosphere and have a relaxing meal on our first night.", "date": "2021-06-03 18:12:20"}

We asked and received better seating at a nearby table closer to the entrance.  \n\nAfter perusing the menu, I settled on the chicken, broccoli and potatoes.  My husband ordered the shrimp and grits thinking that we haven't been any place in New Orleans where this dish wasn't a winner.

However, my husband's shrimp and grits was a big embarrassment. It came in a side dish portion.  Basically,  it was about five teaspoons of grits with five tiny shrimp on top.  He said the taste was pretty good but the portion size was ridiculous for the price.  He had to request some bread to supplement the entree.  I even shared some of my meal so my dear husband wouldn't leave the restaurant hungry.\n\nWe had two servers for our table and no one was really checking to see if we were okay.  Just before receiving the bill, one of the servers came to refill our water glasses and my husband used this opportunity to complain about his meager meal for the price we were paying.  The server seemed quite disinterested and said that she doesn't set the prices.  At no time was she apologetic or offered to bring anything else.  She did say she could send the manager.  She did not follow through with relaying any of his concerns to anyone.  A good server should have taken some sort of responsibility for her table.  \n\nBy this time, my husband was totally annoyed and asked for the bill so that we could leave this sorry excuse for a restaurant.

She offered up a seat at the bar which my friend was not up for.  Said the wait would be an hour and a half for a table.  We were about to leave, and the manager called the hostess over, she said they could accommodate us, not sure what changed.  We were whisked away and seemed like we were heading for the kitchen.  The restaurant appears to be divided into two sections, we ended up in the rear section which overlooks the kitchen.  Which was o k as the restaurant really doesent have a view.

But everyone there was hustling and commited to providing a good experience.  \nWe settled in and ordered a couple of cocktails.  And we're going to start with cooked oysters from the shared plates menu.  Until we learned it was $17 for 4 oysters.  We told the waitress that we needed a minute and she seemed irritated and said she would be back.  This may have been a mistake as we didn't see her for 20 minutes.  Once she got back we ordered we opted for half a dozen raw I think they called it PJ oysters, 2 cups of gumbo and as entrees my friend had the chicken and I opted for the pork cutlet.  \nThe food came quickly we got our oysters and soup at same time, I would have preferred a little bit of separation of time between oysters and soup.  The soup was good but Luke warm.  Oysters were fresh and tasty and $11 for a half dozen which I thought was reasonable. \nEntrees were large, could easily be split. My friend got a half chicken, nicely crisped potatoes, and some type of greens. Presentation could have been on larger plate, and chicken could have had a little more gravy but was tender and moist.  \nMy pork had two large breaded patties and a ton of perfectly cooked fries.  Both were on the well done side which I loved.  \nNormally I would rate this a 3 to 3.5 star experience.

Now while it's known for happy hour every day and fresh seafood, I took a different approach and went for brunch and honey, they did not disappoint.\n\n The very first thing I enjoyed about their menu was the variety. The menu was well balanced w/ both breakfast and lunch items, but didn't overload the guest with too many options. My drink of choice was a French 75. The presentation was great. Cognac glass, lite fizzle and a highlighted 75 to finish it off. And yes, it tasted as good as it looked. \n\n Now let's dig in! For starters, I ordered the \"Crispy Brussels Sprouts\" and the \"Cast Iron Cinnamon Roll\". I truly enjoyed both. The brussels sprouts were fried perfectly w/ toasted almonds, espelette honey and crumble cheese. Oh but the cinnamon roll was fantastic! The candied pecans were a perfect touch, the Creole cream cheese icing was irresistible. The entire cinnamon roll was just so soft, gooey, and warm. I had to stop myself from eating it all to make sure I had room for my meal.\n\n For my main course, I let my server choose for me. He surprised me with \"Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp and Grits\". Man he did not let me down. This order of shrimp  and grits  was a little different from what most restaurants offer. It had a tomato  base, roasted jalape\u00f1o  cheese  grits, andouille & green onion. The amount of heat from the sausage was perfect and the dish had all of your traditional creole flavors, topped off with flawlessly cooked shrimp . My date had  the \"Croque Madame\". It's very similar to a ham, egg, & cheese  sandwich, except the egg   is on top of the sandwich and sunny side up. I would suggest a knife and fork for this cheesy, yolky, goodness. \n\n The server was attentive & knowledgeable. The vibe was nice and the location is fair. If you're not from NOLA, just a little hint, it's not spicy, it's only full of flavor! \nOverall \nFood, Service, & Atmosphere", "date": "2021-08-25 23:44:25"}

It didn't disappoint! The oysters were so fresh and had a great salty taste. I was super impressed with the manager who was attentive to our table and noticed I wasn't drinking my cocktail. When asking me about it I said \" it was a little too bitter for me but please don't worry about it\" instead he took it and immediately doctored it up and then brought it back saying that he would be happy to get me a new one if this didn't help. Well whatever he did to it was delicious and it was so nice to have someone so attentive as fine dining should be. The food was delicious and the service was excellent... both which equally make the expertise of fine dining worth the money.", "date": "2021-12-10 17:20:40"}

The restaurant decor matched historic NOLA and the food was great. We made reservations beforehand and it was a breeze from there getting seated. Our server was sweet and made sure to check up on us often. We went during happy hour but wasn't given an actual happy hour menu. I'm glad I studied the menu beforehand so we tried their boudin bites, crab bisque, dozen raw oysters, oyster platter, crawfish pot pie and brie burger. My wife and I enjoyed the crawfish pot pie the most. It was creamy and succulent while the crust was flaky and delicious. The bisque had great crab flavor throughout and the raw oysters were decently sized. The Oyster platter allowed to try all 6 broiled oysters but our favorites were the rockefeller and the one with bacon. The other 4 kinds were average and nothing to write home about. The brie burger was humongous and the meat patty was moist throughout. The sesame bun was toasted and the burger was everything you want in a gourmet burger. I would definitely come back to Luke next time I visit NOLA.", "date": "2021-12-22 23:31:00"}

Like have you seen oysters this fat?! Worth my money. The fried oysters just melts in your mouth. I would say between these two, I prefer the raw on, given almost every food I ate in NOLA was fried . But also you can taste the natural sweetness in Raw oysters than fried. I also ordered myself 2 drinks (half off) and they were so good!

Because the oysters were so impressively large and fat, I came back my 2nd and 3rd day LOL. Oysters were a bit smaller, like average size on the other days, which was fine because we never know what kind of batch we are going to get. Regardless, they were fresh oysters every day! On my last night, I also tried their shrimp grits and bread pudding. Best shrimp grits EVER. I ordered similar food elsewhere in French Quarters but alot of restaurants make food so salty! This dish highly recommended by people who ate at Luke's and I just had to try it. The quality really lived up to these recommendations. Creamy and it felt like I was eating mash potato (haha). So good! Also the bread pudding was so CRAZY GOOD. I only had bread pudding at Mambo's and I had to go back to edit my review because Luke's really set high standard what bread pudding should be. The bread was so soft and puffy. There were.. walnut and they were powdered and roasted I think. It compliments the dish well. There were also vanilla icecream. If you grab some bread and icecream, it literally melts in your mouth with satisfaction. This is one of my top 2 recommendations to come back to!", "date": "2021-12-29 01:14:05"}
