So if you ever favor a cake, call to ask before going as they might not have specific ones on the menu that day. So far, we try opera, red velvet, tiramisu, macarons, cookies and cream, bird milk soufle, carrot cake, triton etc.... Our favorite is Cookies and Cream. Of course it doesn't look pretty but it tastes really creamy. The rest meh, we didn't like the taste, like some taste funny. For example, whatever they put in the carrot cake, it alter it's flavor quite a bit. \n\nThey also carry a dine in menu. We finally have time to sit in and enjoy this time. I find out they have meat and sweet breakfast items. Variety flavors of smoothies and milkshakes. Also hot tea and caffeinated drinks.

While they were all delicious, my favorite was the Colombian, a rich chocolate mousse with a little creme center with a layer of almond cake underneath, and then the whole thing was coated with a thin dark chocolate shell. My second favorite was a round pastry coated with hazelnuts with a Russian sounding name. The inside was a dense hazelnut cake. It was not very sweet at all. The Paris Brest was not a bad choice either with a thick layer of praline cream sandwiched between two light round pastry layers. \n\nThe total for those three pastries was $10.55. They also packaged them up nicely in a large take out container so we got them home in mint condition.
