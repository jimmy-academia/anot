I've been going to Kayuh for 2 years now.\n\nNumber one draw: the mechanics themselves. They are amazingly kind, accurate, articulate, helpful, and talented. Both the work itself and their advice is on-point and impeccable. They've always been happy to show me what's going on with my bike, explain my options when I'm on a budget, and when the shop is quiet they've even walked me through the fix so I can venture at it on my own the next time. Also they're hilarious and total jokesters... \n\nSecondly, the prices are great and easily compare with all the other shops around town.\n\n(also total bonus there's a coffee shop there while you wait for your bike service! the baristas are friendly and the coffee is delicious!)\n\nAs a queer, female identified but gender-queer presenting human this space is hella safe and so welcoming. As someone that doesn't do a whole lot of their own repairs, no one there has ever treated me like I don't know what i'm talking about with my bike  ...even when I genuinely don't! THANK YOU! :) I've sat in the shop many days and I've watched them treat every single person that comes in that door amazingly and with total respect.

I have taken my bike to other shops for lots of reasons but for months I was feeling and hearing the same concerning issue and I always mentioned it to the other shops, but the problem never went away. I asked Iz for a tune up and asked him about the consistent problem. Iz was the only person that said he felt something was wrong with the bottom bracket. After fully explaining what the issues could be and taking out the bottom bracket to see it's condition Henry and I decided it needed to be replaced. They explained all of the issues my bike had in simple terms and allowed me to decide what I wanted to have done. The moment I got back on my bike I knew the problem had been resolved and my bike ran and still runs like new!!!!
