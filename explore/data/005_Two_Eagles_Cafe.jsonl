It was perfectly smokey, filled with generous amounts of diced peppers and topped classically with large cheese shavings and a fried egg. It had really great flavor and was accompanied with toast to soak up that deep tomato sauce that was really so delicious! A winning dish for sure! I enjoyed experiencing another region of the world's take on a plate I enjoy so much in places like Israel and Morocco! \n\nThe rest of the fam indulged in breakfast Sammies, creating their own omelets with a variety of fresh ingredients, sweet delicate crepes filled with Nutella, bananas and strawberries, sides of crispy fried potatoes and tender sausage. \n\nWe picked up some fresh OJ and Perrier from the self-serve fridge case, along with ordering various simple cafe offerings like teas (a fruity herbal and English Breakfast black) and Americanos.\n\n Everything was really well liked by all and the prices were astonishing low! MAJOR points for being able to reserved a table for brunch in the city, too! Unheard of these days and I highly recommend doing so if you'll have a larger party like we did, as the corner place is on the smaller side. \n\nThe issue we had here was the wait for our food, which I believe was only for the laborious egg dish from their culture. Next time I would definitely ask for items to be brought out as they're ready and safely assumed I'll be waiting longer when ordering the fregese. You should too, as I noticed others around us who also ordered that dish were waiting. \n\nI would definitely hit up this uber casual spot again, keeping in mind the wait for the fergese, but it was pretty memorable and in my opinion, worth it! \n\nUnmetered street parking.", "date": "2019-03-16 12:22:35", "user": {"name": "Sari Marissa", "review_count": 1403, "yelping_since": "2009-09-01 22:27:07", "elite": "2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.37, "fans": 646}}
