I ordered this item as I have a dairy allergy and was excited to see a pizza that I didn't have to ask to be modified in order to be dairy free. Both on their menu and on Uber eats it explicitly states that this pizza does not contain cheese.\n\nSo I get my pizza in a timely manner from Uber Eats, and when I open the box, what do I see? A pizza with ONLY cheese, peppers, and onions. There was not even sauce on the pizza and it did not contain any of the other toppings that were stated on the menu... I also received the actual A Tutti receipt and it stated the correct order, so I am very unsure how such a big mixup happened.\n\nI call the restaurant and they state that they will remake the pizza and have their delivery person deliver it to me as soon as possible. She stated that the driver will call me when he arrives at my apartment. So I wait for about 40 min and then TRY calling the restaurant back to ask what the ETA is. However, now their phone is not working. I had to call about 10 times for about 15 min before I can get through to the restaurant. When I finally get through, they state that they have been waiting for me to call back, because they were unable to get my address from Uber Eats. So I give it to them, and they state that it should be delivered soon.\n\nAnother 30 min go by and I have still not received my pizza or heard from the restaurant so I call back again, but of course it takes another 10 min of calling to get through. When I finally do they state that the driver is out making other deliveries, and if he was not back in 5 min that they would call the driver and then call me when the driver was on the way to my apartment. So after ANOTHER 30 min I try calling the restaurant, and \"surprisingly\" cannot  get through so I decide to get in my car and drive to the restaurant. As soon as I get there, I get a call from the delivery guy that he is at my apartment. I had not received a call from the restaurant stating he was on his way as promised.\n\nI go into the restaurant hoping to speak with the manager. I told the woman that had been answering the phone that I was expecting a refund seeing as it took all-in-all almost 3 hours to get the correct order delivered from the time I ordered it on Uber Eats until the time I got the pizza. She told me that when the manager was not busy, he would call Uber Eats to get my refund, so we will see if that happens. Also, I was obviously frustrated and upset with this whole situation, and this woman at the counter was giving ME attitude. \n\nSo now I am sitting here eating the pizza, and it is soggy, tasteless, and obviously very cold.

I had previously given A Tutti 3/5 based on a dinner service, and I recently attempted to give them another shot which revealed to me that I was mistaken in my 3-star judgment: let's bump that down to 1-star and dive into the lambasting, shall we?\n\nThe entire point of the hospitality service is just that: to provide guests with a good experience and to make them feel welcome. This was the total opposite of my most recent - and definitely last experience - at A Tutti. I want so badly to have a good pasta restaurant near my house, so I decided to give them another shot, and boy did I regret it! My friend and I ordered a salad on focaccia, and pasta and meatballs. Pretty standard fare for an Italian place, right?\n\nMy food - the pasta and meatballs - came out of the kitchen pretty quickly. Notably absent was a salad, which seemed odd since normally Caesar salads are pretty quick to prepare, right? We waited about 10 minutes in the absence of the aforementioned salad - and our waiter - so I decided to take things into my own hands and beckoned over who appeared to be the owner (I believe his name is Paul). Upon learning that we were missing a salad (read: on focaccia), he retreated to the kitchen to presumably fix this problem. \n\nA few minutes later, the salad, devoid of focaccia - Paul in tow - sauntered over to our table. Our waiter joined Paul in delivering this incorrect dish to us with a smug expression on his face, and remarked, \"It's all Paul's fault!\"\n\nIn response to our evident displeasure, Paul asked, \"Was this supposed to be on focaccia?\" To our great dismay - and I can't make this up - after we affirmed his query he responded with, \"Oh well! I'll take it off the bill.\" (Said in reference to the additional charge of the focaccia NOT the whole salad.) What? He did not even offer to fix the dish that was wrongfully prepared. Just an \"Oh well.\"\n\nThis was such a backwards experience, all in the pursuit of truly mediocre pasta. The cacio e pepe I received this time was as awful as ever, the salty punch of pecorino was nowhere to be found and instead was replaced by an acrid, plasticky pre-ground black pepper flavor. \n\nI will absolutely not be giving them a third chance, and I most definitely hope this review saves some other poor souls from sharing a similar experience. Go in grace, friends.\n\n-- \n\nI have been dying to go to A Tutti for a while now because I'm very eager to find an Italian restaurant it's great pasta near me. Unfortunately, I was let down by the pasta at A Tutti, but everything else was pretty good and I like the energy of the place, so I do want to go back and try again.\n\nService: Our server Sarah was great. She was super friendly and gave us good advice throughout the meal.\n\nAmbiance: I felt like I was in a little trattoria in Italy. Very authentic vibe with big band and swing music playing which further transported me out of Roxborough and into another time. We were immediately greeted warmly like family when we walked in, and I couldn't stop smiling after that. \n\nFood: Definitely some stuff that can be worked on, here. I will start with my sad pasta, cacio e pepe, which was bland, gummy (overcooked & stuck together), and truly unpleasant to eat. It had none of the sharpness I would expect from a dish which is supposed to primarily consist of Pecorino Romano, and I really couldn't even eat it. We also got the carbonara, which tasted good, but the egg was hugely scrambled (GIANT pieces of scrambled egg) and was a far cry from the luxurious, rich sauce you expect from this dish. I am not sure if we just got a bad night on the pasta front or if they need to tweak their recipes, but this was definitely a letdown.\n\nWe also got pizza, flatbread, tomato soup, and meatballs. All of this was awesome and tasted very authentic. The pizza was crispy - I love the dough - and had bright, tomatoey sauce with sweet, chewy cheese.

Also, Dan and the cook told us that they can whip up a special pasta dish with the ingredients they did have in the kitchen. We really appreciated the accommodation and the pasta was great!

I'm downgrading it to ONE.\n\nOne of my writing buddies from Manayunk was heading over to my neck of the city so I could help him with editing a project. I offered to make dinner but he said he'd pick something up on the way so we'd have more time to edit. I was in doubt of anything good coming from Rox/Wiss/Manayunk-but hope springs eternal and my thought was, \"Fine with me\", lazy sod that I truly am.\n\nWhat did Jake bring for dinner? Yep, you guessed it. A salad and a Tre Carne pizza from A Tutti. He was utterly chuffed with himself, saying Michael Klein from The Inquirer had just reviewed the place so he knew the food must be good. I like Jake a lot so rather than criticize his choice or look a gift horse in the mouth, I made us a pitcher of sangria, told him he was a mensch, set the table and figured the second time's the charm.\n\nNo. It's certainly not. \n\nThe \"Caesar\" salad was just as bad as it was the first time I got it. Lots of the ends of romaine, mostly yellow with too much of that salty, gaggingly fishy dressing, 2 anchovy filets and a piece of lemon laid atop the yellows-umm-I mean the 'greens.'  I passed. Told Jake he was looking like he was not getting enough fiber in his diet as I crossed my fingers behind my back and said I'd already had a huge salad for lunch. \n\nThe Tre Carne pizza was definitely a pizza but it was minus the carne. Not a scrap of pig or cow. It still came with the half burned basil scattered all over it like before, very little cheese and no black olives or meat of any kind to be found on top, in the box or up Jake's sleeve. I asked Jake if he was okay with me crisping it up a bit. He said 'do your thing,' so I discreetly grated some mozz, drizzled on some garlic oil, sliced up and scattered some pepperoni, dug out a few long hots, dressed the pathetic pie, put it on a pizza stone and gave it a blast in the oven. The fluffing helped. Just barely.  \n\nWe ate the pie because it was there, Jake had some polite forkfuls of the sad salad then moved it to my fridge, we gloried in the sangria and later in the bounty of frozen goodies I'd bought a few days before from Lil Pop Shop.\n\nA Tutti-you let me down again.", "date": "2019-06-27 19:55:34", "user": {"name": "Warren", "review_count": 167, "yelping_since": "2006-03-12 01:04:23", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.26, "fans": 67}}

She was super friendly and gave us good advice throughout the meal.\n\nAmbiance: I felt like I was in a little trattoria in Italy. Very authentic vibe with big band and swing music playing which further transported me out of Roxborough and into another time.

I will start with my sad pasta, cacio e pepe, which was bland, gummy (overcooked & stuck together), and truly unpleasant to eat. It had none of the sharpness I would expect from a dish which is supposed to primarily consist of Pecorino Romano, and I really couldn't even eat it. We also got the carbonara, which tasted good, but the egg was hugely scrambled (GIANT pieces of scrambled egg) and was a far cry from the luxurious, rich sauce you expect from this dish. I am not sure if we just got a bad night on the pasta front or if they need to tweak their recipes, but this was definitely a letdown.\n\nWe also got pizza, flatbread, tomato soup, and meatballs. All of this was awesome and tasted very authentic. The pizza was crispy - I love the dough - and had bright, tomatoey sauce with sweet, chewy cheese. The flatbread was made from the same dough and delivered crispy, herbal rosemary perfectly. The tomato soup was exquisite and was particularly tasty with the breads dipped into it!

Hospitality here is fantastic. It's that down home, casual friendliness that I have not found anywhere other than Philly. The new owners turned what was a depressing space into a warm, nice looking environment. The prior business, also pizza, was abysmal with surroundings to match. A Tutti is clean and looks like a place where you wouldn't mind settling in and enjoying a meal. \n\nNot so nice or good was my Caesar salad which consisted of a large handful of not so fresh looking, yellow romaine, a few slivers of cheese, a lemon wedge (?!) and a dressing that tasted heavily of anchovy and salt. Where the hell were the herb croutons? Cracked black pepper? Sorry not sorry-this was a pathetic excuse for any kind of salad, never even mind that it wasn't what was described on the menu. 3 bites convinced me this was a waste of money and plate space and not worth taking home for later.\n\nThe Tre Carne pizza also saddened me. The puffy, browned crust hinted at what was going to be a toothsome, worth waiting for pie but damn-that crust lied to me. Bottom was blackened, bordering on burnt. The center of the pizza was soggily wet, limp and floppy. Careful excavation revealed no mozzarella at all, though again, that's what the menu promised. The pie was sloppily thrown together and who ever said that fresh basil should be roasted with the rest of the pie's ingredients? Uh uh. Bad move. The few basil leaves scattered on the pizza were crisp from the oven and tasted like overdone marijuana; bitter and brackish. The paper thin slices of mushroom fared equally badly in the oven, coming out leathery and flavorless, making me miss the earthy marriage of funghi to sweet tomato sauce. And the sauce? Umm-made me wish for shakers of garlic powder and oregano or even the ubiquitous dried chiles I used to rely on at the buck a slice joints to give it some taste. *sobs*\n\nI purposely chose to eat here instead of the chain-Santucci's-on Ridge but dammit-it will be my last visit to A Tutti.

The waitress didn't offer dessert and had to return for order clarification. But for me- high quality food, nice people, and affordable prices will overrule the lack of service expertise. If you are on the fence, I say try it! The meal will not disappoint.", "date": "2019-01-20 20:58:59", "user": {"name": "J.", "review_count": 12, "yelping_since": "2015-05-15 18:38:38", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.31, "fans": 0}}

The focaccia could be amazing, but there was waaaay too much rosemary. After I took the rosemary off it tasted much better. The pizza was good, they put your toppings on top of the focaccia, which was interesting. The caccio e peppe was a complete let down. It was really low quality noodles with a horrible caccio e peppe type of sauce, tasted like it came from a Lipton packet. \nI was going to give it 2 stars but the staff was genuinely nice and helpful. The room itself was very well decorated as well. I would return here for the focaccia as a quick snack. What a shame after reading the reviews I seriously was looking fwd to this place.", "date": "2019-01-19 02:05:32", "user": {"name": "Brad", "review_count": 8, "yelping_since": "2009-08-19 03:27:25", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.5, "fans": 0}}

It was tasty but had hardly any cheese on it ! Some slices has maybe a half a bite of pizza with cheese on it and in my book cheese is a very important part of a pizza! The lack of cheese meant the pizza wasn't really very filling, which was a pretty big disappointment. I would have given two stars but it was very tasty, even if it was more like bread with marinara sauce on it. I might not give it a forger shot but If I do I definitely will order extra cheese !", "date": "2019-01-14 02:24:24", "user": {"name": "Tim", "review_count": 102, "yelping_since": "2014-07-26 04:32:33", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.51, "fans": 1}}

The Bianca Aglio (White pizza) is the best I've ever had! Fresh made focaccia bread and also the home made tomato soup was to die for!!! Can't forget dessert! Home made pizzelles with a delicious cup of coffee to finish it off and the owner could not be nicer! Absolutely will be back this place is wonderful and very decently priced!!!", "date": "2019-01-09 11:45:47", "user": {"name": "Daniel", "review_count": 21, "yelping_since": "2015-01-26 00:45:49", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.81, "fans": 0}}
