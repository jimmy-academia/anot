The man on the phone told me that I owed $9.00 in addition to what I already paid. I was obviously really confused, because where did this extra $9.00 come from?? I asked what it was for and he just said that I owed it. I even double checked my seamless receipt and credit card statement while I had him on the phone to verify that I paid the $26.00 in full.  So he started asking for verification from a woman in the background - I could hear them arguing with each other. He seemed a bit confused as to why he was calling me.  He asked her if she wanted to talk to me and I hear her yell \"I don't even care, just give it to her for free at this point.\" \n\nGive me what for free? I paid for both things that I ordered!  I calmly explained that I didn't owe anything extra, but they just kept on asking for the $9.00. Finally the woman takes the phone, says 'thank you' and hangs up. What????

I do hope that the owner takes heed and incorporates some sensitivity training.  A customer with a disability should NEVER be made to feel responsible for a service professionals laziness or lack of willingness to perform their job.  Nor should they have to take extreme efforts to receive the same level of service as non-disabled persons.\n\nThis was one of my favorite go-to places for palatable food and so as I have done for the better part of two years since moving here, I ordered online through my besty @Eat24 for delivery.  The \"delivery\" person called my cell to let me know that the food was outside.  I told him to knock on the door and someone would collect the food (a note that is included in the special instructions, btw).   The \"delivery\" person refused because I \"wasn't in the house.\"\n\nI figured maybe he needed assurance so I explained that the order was already paid for and that there is someone in the house to collect the food from him, he need only to knock. I only ordered and paid for it as I have done multiple times in the past.  He again refused.  He said he calls because he \"expects you to answer the door while you are on the phone.\" \n\nI explained to the \"delivery\" person that the order was already paid for and it was noted that he would have to knock on the door to \"deliver\" it to the deaf person inside, not sit outside two houses down and beep the horn.   I also explained in this day and age of cell phones and the internet, his expectation was rather...archaic ....to say the very least.  His response was to leave, refusing to deliver the food until someone was standing in the door to greet him. \n\nSo I called the restaurant and explained to the manager that there was a deaf person receiving the order and the \"delivery\" person needed to knock to alert the service animals who'd in turn alert someone to answer the door ...not too complex for a delivery person - based on the fact that \"delivering\" food is part of his job description and all.  I complained to no avail, my daughter had to stand in the doorway waiting for the delivery person to eventually come back.  Truly a minor inconvenience  in the world today, especially after I contacted Eat24 for help and as usual their amazing customer service made this experience better than it was.  \n\nSo why am I writing this review with only one star when we really like the food and Eat24's customer service response wins the day every time?  \n\nBecause when I called the restaurant to complain to the manager about the \"delivery\" person refusing to deliver, he pretty much said that it is not his \"delivery\" person's responsibility to knock on the door and deliver the food \"just because someone is deaf, she should have someone there helping her.\"             0_o?   \n\nWell my good man, I can only agree with you that it is not your \"delivery\" person's job to take the food to the door... and knock on it... \"just because a customer is deaf.\"  I mean it's preposterous to think that anyone would make such a demand!  --Yet conversely, because he is a \"delivery\" person isn't it his job to take the food to the door and knock on it... because that is the actual definition of DELIVERY?  And a person in that position can sometimes be required to DELIVER things? \n\nA delivery person delivering something that is just a novel idea, isn't it?", "date": "2015-11-24 06:43:57", "user": {"name": "Fyre", "review_count": 43, "yelping_since": "2013-11-08 08:18:53", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.43, "fans": 1}}

I ordered a stromboli online, and I half expected them to call with an issue because that seems to be a common experience.\n\nIn fact they did call with an issue, ten minutes later. The woman called me and said that the price I was given when I ordered FROM THEIR WEBSITE was wrong. I said that it certainly was not, and that I had ordered from their own menu. I then pointed out that I had used a $5.00 coupon, one that they advertise both on their website and on the paper menu they left at my home, in BIG BOLD LETTERS. \"Sign Up For Our Rewards Points and Get $5 Off!\"\n\nShe said \"Oh you had a coupon? It don't say there here.\" Okay then. Your own system doesn't recognize that I utilized a coupon on your own website with a code that your own website emailed me five minutes ago? This did not bode well for what was to come.\n\nWhen the delivery guy got nearby he called and asked for the cross street, and then said he was rounding the corner. I put on shoes and was just about to walk out my door to go downstairs when the buzzer for the front door rang. My order specifically said to call, NOT to ring the buzzer. My orders always say this, because I don't want to bother my housemate who sleeps in the day and works at night. I have NEVER had a problem until today.\n\nI went down to the door and was honestly just devoid of reaction, but I had a very Miranda Priestly moment when I said \"I don't know why you felt the need to press the buzzer when I just told you I was on my way down. I'm sorry I wasn't able to move at a pace exceeding speeds achievable by human beings.\" I'm kind of proud of that.\n\nAnyway the food is disgusting. Firstly this isn't a stromboli, it's a calzone. YES, there is a difference. Secondly the very SMELL of it was sour, so you can only imagine the taste. It tastes like rotten dough was wrapped around fetid cheese and meat.

I was a little put off by the same employees when I walked over to the restaurant to pick up my food. \n\nThe spaghetti and meatballs I ordered were barely edible. Unseasoned, topped with entirely too much cheese and the meatballs were cut up for some reason instead of left whole. I'm assuming they're not made in house.\n\nI guess it's hard to mess up a cheese-steak so if I am forced to eat from this place again I think that might be the only thing I would order.\n\nOtherwise, I would recommend not steering too far away from things of that nature.", "date": "2013-06-05 01:00:24", "user": {"name": "Janene", "review_count": 5, "yelping_since": "2011-10-26 22:52:45", "elite": "", "average_stars": 1.6, "fans": 0}}
