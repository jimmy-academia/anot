Man it was good. The place was packed even though we had late reservations. And all the food we spied on at the table next to us looked so incredibly tempting, especially the oven roasted redfish! My belly was happy. Gawd, I love this place.\n\n---\n\nI was starting to suffer from withdrawal symptoms since I had not been to Cochon since March of last year. Simply put, Cochon has an unbelievable combination of ingredients (think seafood, animal 'parts', taste, flavor, texture, and savoriness that I had long thought is what 'real food' in Acadiana (real Cajun Country) must taste like. I have been to Cochon several times and the last few times, I was with my dinner group once and the other time with many friends in town for Jazz Fest. Both of those times, we ordered everything on the menu and just kept passing the dishes around (and ordering more of the table's favorites).\n\nSo when one of my good friends (straight out of Lafayette) told me she hadn't been there, I knew we had to go. She also knew one of the managers there who also had been trying to get her to eat there. Next thing you know, we are there ready 'to get our grub on'.\n\nWe first went to the bar and I ordered a Satsuma Mojito. Talk about a light, tasty and an absolutely pleasurable drink - this may be my new favorite cocktail. No kidding! We asked her friend about the menu and we quickly ordered many of the things he recommended - boucherie plate, fried alligator with chili garlic aioli, fried boudin with pickled peppers, wood fired oyster roast, and pork cheek. The boucherie plate included: house-made jerky, liver cheese spread, hogs head cheese, and an assortment of smoked/flavored hams. Friggin' awesome! I'm not normally a fan of hogs head cheese, but I tore up Cochon's freshly made version. The gator had to be the best tasting gator dish I have had in recent memory (and I eat a lot of gator). Delicately battered and fried gator with a wonderful, spicy aioli (simply scrumptious!). The boudin was crispy and flavorful. The oysters were roasted and served on the half shell with an incredibly refreshing sauce. And the 'medallions' of pork cheek was surprisingly meaty and 'not cheeky' (bad pun, I know). It was nicely seasoned and very good. I should also mentioned that we absolutely loved the bread and butter as well. Imagine the smell and texture of some very fresh french bread - not too crusty, but just enough that it would light flake off in your mouth - yummy!\n\nWhile my friend might have had some hesitation that Cochon would not accurately reflect the food of Cajuns, she said that food was as good as what she ate at home - a great and well deserved compliment! So my friend and I decided that since Cochon is only a 5 minute bike ride from our neighborhood, we'll have to back...often. \n\nIt was truly an enjoyable meal. The atmosphere at Cochon is very laid back but chic. If you want to experience true Cajun food in NOLA, do yourself a favor and dine at Cochon.", "date": "2008-01-28 18:03:56"}

Instead, I got a side of grits with our entrees which we all shared.\n\nAfter first considering the beef brisket entre, I ordered the ham hock with lima bean hoppin' john & mustard onion jus ($17).  Wow!  I'm sure the brisket would have been great too, but having never seen a ham hock outside of my mother's pea soup (much less on a menu), this dish was a treat.  I was very glad I I ordered it.  \n\nFor dessert, we shared the strawberry cobbler and I have craved it ever since.  Biscuits, sweet-but-not-too-sweet fruit and fresh whipped cream - perfection.\n\nOur service was spectacular.  We asked a lot of questions about the menu and our server was informed in a way that showed that she hadn't just memorized its details, but truly knew its nuances and was passionate about them.", "date": "2008-05-03 03:03:32"}

My visit to Cochon in rebounding New Orleans, left me full, fat and happy! I hope it lasts forever so I can go back one day to be dined and delighted with pig parts and authentic  southern cooking. The post-modern lodge style dining room amuses with porcine decor, sleek, utlilitarian picnic-style tables, benches and stools. A warehouse location and trendy bar crowd sets the scene.\n\nComplimentary bread has become so passez over the years, even those pencil thin breadsticks and wafer thin parmesan flatbread are so yawn that it's mighty refreshing when someone plops down a basket of WARM HOMEMADE POTATO ROLLS in front of you. Cochon makes a batch every 20 minutes and they contain real potato puree. The rolls and consideration for jaded-foodie palates gets 5 stars.\n\nCochon does small plates and entrees so you can get your fill of local favorites and house specialties. Standouts from the Boucherie are fried boudin balls with pieces of pulled pork and deep flavor. My small plate of BBQ pork ribs came out cold though the sauce was tangy and sweet enough while I was looking for more smokiness. Fried pigs ears and rabbit livers I see more of a novelty for people like my dinner companion for whom having something fried and/or weird is a must for every fine dining experience. \n\nThere's plenty of love for the local cuisine: My hen and adouille gumbo had a flavourful (and memorable) dark roux. Roasted Gulf redfish (a specialty of the chef) was picture perfect and it's flesh is melt in your mouth. A side of pecan-broccoli dressing was (surprise!) gratineed and rich. And, the eponymous Louisiana cochon was salty, moist and flavorful-\"very enjoyable\" said my wide-eyed companion.\n\nOf course, the fruit cobbler was a must, but sadly the only real disappointment of the night. The local strawberries were warm with a natural non-cloying sweetness but clashed with the somewhat doughy biscuits baked with a distracting (in a bad way) hint of ginger. My one suggestion for the dessert menu is to make a traditional lattice cobbler topping or biscuits without ginger. I loved everything else, this just made for an odd finish.\n\nCochon was the culinary risk of my most recent trip to New Orleans. I had turned down Brigsten's and boycotted Besh. And, I was NOT disappointed. Chef Donald Link forced his way back into a broken city to get Cochon up and running. You can taste that passion in every cajun-style bite.", "date": "2008-05-18 22:22:35"}

It was definitely a meat heavy dinner, but if I had more space, I would've ordered the pork cheeks with corncake! \n\nAfterwards, I was too full of pork to do anything, but it was definitely worth it. Some of the dishes were a miss, like the hot sausage, but the cochon and the fried alligator was absolutely mouth watering.", "date": "2008-10-21 15:28:33"}

It was an easy decision to go the small-plate route since it was our first time and we wanted to try several dishes.\n\nOn the recommendation of our nice server, we got the \"wood-fired oyster roast\" and were very happy we did, as the spicy sauce they serve gives oysters a different flavor than you get elsewhere.  Raw oysters are nice, as are fried ones, but this is inventive and really good.\n\n\"fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly toast\" - not something I'd seen on any menu before, so I thought I'd gamble on this.  Really excellent - creamy liver flavor with a nice slightly sweet jelly is a perfect combination.\n\n\"onion braised pork cheeks with grits & horseradish herb vinaigrette\" - the pork is perfect and is complemented nicely by creamy grits.  Worth getting.\n\n\"smoked mullet & crab cake with shell bean salad\"  - as much as I liked the rabbit livers, this got the biggest wow.  Again, a real novelty of a dish and executed perfectly.  \n\nGot to try the alligator, as well, because I asked the guy next to me what he was eating and he kindly offered to share.

The service was fast and attentive, without being overbearing (e.g., our water glasses were filled throughout the night before we even noticed). \n\nThe restaurant is clean and comfy looking, as opposed to being overly austere and cold.  We didn't have any kids with us (except maybe for the bday boy's 60-something year old dad who can be quite immature at times), but kids would be quite comfy there.  \n\nAll the dishes were enjoyable.

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and loved by everyone but me (I just don't dig sweet BBQ sauces that much). \n\nHenceforth, we had a salad that was fresh and tasty with pecans and mandarin oranges. \n\nFor our main dishes, we had the following: \n\ncatfish courtbouillon $19 \nlouisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage & cracklins $22 \nsmoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad $18 \n\nAll three were excellent, with most people's favorite surprisingly being the brisket.

It was served with a side of potato salad and looked, well, boring and bland.  I will say, the fish special, the baked Red Fish, was divine!  It was flaky, well cooked and seasoned and served in an appropriate portion.  It was a table favorite.  Several folks ordered sides (mac and cheese, brocolli/rice casserole and eggplant casserole) and they were all just OK, not good, not bad.  \n\nBottom line:  The menu was unique and some of the dishes were pretty good, but I got the feeling that they were trying too hard.  Order the Red Fish and steer clear of the \"cochon\".  The atmosphere was lovely- I very much liked the fresh/clean architecture and open kitchen.  But the service and the bar was awful!   Several of us had to grab our plates back from the waitress to keep her from taking food we weren't finished with!  And she actually took a bread plate from me that contained a buttered roll with one bite removed... girl was anxious!    If you want a good meal for the price, try something else.", "date": "2009-02-06 20:02:05"}

Our main dishes and sides arrived so quickly thereafter that we wondered aloud if they'd been pre-made and microwaved. I don't care how they do it, each dish was so good that we all took turns sharing fork-fulls off each plate. Portions were generous enough that we couldn't quite lick our plates. Once again, dessert became out of the question. The final consensus of our gang o' four was that the pork and seafood dishes bested the beef brisket in flavor.

We had fried alligator with a mint creme sauce(awesome by the way), ham hock (that fell off the bone) and lentils, and beef brisket with sweet potatoes. All were artfully, not stuffily, presented. I finished off the meal with a slice of flourless chocolate cake with cream cheese icing. When I die, I want to go to New Orleans. I have definitely not found food like this in Southern California, nor do I plan on finding it here. \n\nLuckily, we did not have to wait hours as some of the other reviewers have noted. However, when we got there, the hostess asked if we had reservations, and when we responded \"no,\" she seemed a bit perturbed. That is thee only complaint I have about this place. It is definitely a must if you go to NOLA. \n\nP.S. I have always respected cultures that use EVERY part of the animal they kill in some way. Cochon buy whole pigs and uses every part in some sort of dish. Hence the pork cheeks.", "date": "2009-04-18 01:16:09"}

I was not in that groove, so to me it felt just crowded.\n\nService was OK, but confused. A beer order went unfilled for a bit longer than necessary and we did not seem to have a designated server. They were all very pleasant and helpful, but it seemed strange that we interacted with two or three different people. It's almost like they were rotating around the room.\n\nWe were very happy with our food. A starter of fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly was perfect in every way. The jelly was peppery but not hot and the livers were meaty, fresh-tasting nuggets of goodness. Very well executed.\n\nPaneed pork cheeks with goat cheese arugula & beet r\u00f6sti were likewise delicious. Small, meaty and tender, the pork cheeks were a perfect match with the goat cheese and r\u00f6sti.

Succulent, sweet and full of corny goodness, we ran our fingers around the inside of the bowl to make sure we got every last molecule.\n\nOverall we were very pleased with Cochon.

However, my friend and I found that the taste of the food did not live up to the interesting menu descriptions.  The high-ceilings and simple wooden furniture compliment the Warehouse District location of this basic restaurant.  When I say \"basic\", I mean that in the best sense of the word.  Cochon cooking stands for freshness, simple ingredients, and down-to-earth flavor.  The prices are reasonable, and the service is attentive, possibly to a fault.  We were easily confused by the 3+ waitstaff members that checked in on us throughout the meal.\n\nOur early evening dinner began with the renown Pork Cheeks.  The moist \"other white meat\" was served in three large chunks atop a crisp beet chip.  A topping of fresh asparagus and plate garnish of goat cheese gobs were meant to enhance flavor, but did little to do so.  Though goat cheese usually packs intense taste, these gooey dribbles were as bland as could be.  While we enjoyed the pork cheeks, we did not find them very memorable.  The beet chip was the real highlight of the plate, adding texture, bold tartness, and rich color.  We also decided to be brave and try the Fried Alligator small plate.  The crisp balls of tough meat were satisfying, and a chili garlic aioli sealed the deal.  The spiced oil added a kick to the otherwise bland meat, reminiscent of lamb.\n\nWe washed down our B-list appetizers with a first class, seasonal strawberry lager.  The wheat beverage was enhanced by real berry puree.  It was then time to move on to our D-list entrees.  My Smoked Beef Brisket was terrible!  Each slice was full of fat, and the fiery taste was overpowering.  The side of Horseradish Potato Salad was strangely bland and goopy.   My friend ordered the Over-Roasted Redfish, which was dressed in an Italian marinade and served \"Fisherman's Style\" (skin and bones left just on the bottom).  The fish was actually moist and light, and we wound up switching meals.  Her side of Eggplant & Shrimp Dressing was essentially a greasy, breaded casserole containing the vegetable and shellfish named in the title.  We were not impressed.\n\nCochon's mediocre food was a disappointment.  Visitors to the city could find better hyped-up options.", "date": "2009-05-15 19:48:41"}

The entrees were mediocre, but not exceptional and the service was so-so.\n\nThe Smoked Beef Brisket was bland and excessively fatty, and yes, I am aware the Brisket is a fatty cut of meat. However, my Brisket was all fat and no meat and the accompanying Horseradish Potato Salad seemed to be missing its namesake ingredient.\n\nHowever, I cannot call the evening a complete failure as our appetizer was very tasty and perfectly cooked (the Spicy Grilled Pork Ribs with Pickled Watermelon - I should have ordered a second as my entree) and my husband very much enjoyed his Catfish Courtboullion.\n\nAlso, we went around 6pm on a Wednesday evening to an empty dining room and were told we would have to sit outside or wait until after 9.

Although the place was fairly packed, service was quite good and our glasses did not stay empty for much time.\n\nGoing into Cochon, I already knew what I wanted to try. Some of the input was from opinions on here, as well as of locals who we met at bars. We just had to try the fried alligator, rabbit livers, and pork cheeks. For entrees, I had the Louisiana cochon, while my boyfriend ordered the Rabbit & Dumplings - which was raved about on here.\n\nThe fried alligator was quite good. Although a bit tough, the aioli it was smothered in was divine and just perfect. NOM, indeed. As far as the rabbit livers go, I was not impressed. The breading kept completely falling off the livers, and they tasted rather bland. I'm actually surprised to read the other reviews about how \"flavorful\" they were. Maybe I received a batch from the boring chef?\n\nBy far, the most standout item of the night were the pork cheeks. Oh. My. God. Anthony Bourdain does not lie when he claims that the cheeks are the filet mignon of the pig. They were so soft, and tender that it brings a tear to my eye when I think of the deliciousness. The sauce they come in is perfect and the little pieces of beets just round it all up.\n\nMy entree, the cochon was also very very good. It was tender and filling and I would order it again in a heartbeat. I wish I could say the same for the rabbit & dumplings. The dish was very bland and contained these turnip-like veggies that still had a hard skin on them. I wish I could tell you what they were but they completely unappetizing and threw my boyfriend off from the whole meal. \n\nOverall, I'll have to give Cochon 3 stars because though pork dishes were indeed fantastic, the rest of the food sampled did not stand out at all. \n\nGo!

Waiter walks over about 1 minute after we sat down and asked if we were ready to order....um, no. \n\nHe comes back about 2 mintues later to check on beverages - we asked him for a bottle of Chardonnay (on their standing menu, mind you - and $45).  He leaves...and returns a minute later to tell us they were 'out' of that bottle.  Are you kidding? One of your ONLY 2 bottles of Chardonnay under $50 on your STANDING menu, and you're out? It was a Saturday night, 8pm.  Of course, to add insult to injury, they had ONE selection of Chardonnay that you could buy by the glass.....ONE.  (BTW, it was crap and tasted more like a Sauv Blanc.)\n\nWe ordered the fried alligator in chili sauce - but were all turned off by the mint leaves they dress it with - just an odd flavor combo which ended up being a theme for the night.\n\nI had the roasted fish, which came with (I think) a side of pickled onion?? And I also ordered the greens - which ended up tasting like collards cooked in pure vinegar and sugar. I guess considering the place was called, \"PORK\", Id get savory greens slow roasted with ham hocks....instead, it was the most acidic, sweet, weird side dish Ive ever had - well, next to the pickled onions -- did not eat either. The fish was severly underseasoned, although, it was roasted perfectly. I had to add salt and pepper, but it was still very bland in flavor. \n\nOh ya....we finished our glass of wine by the time our entree's came and the waiter never asked if we'd like another beverage or glass...um. Really?\n\nMy friend had the brisket and potato salad (both good), but her side of lima beans were not even room temperature and had to be sent back. Our other friend had the shrimp, and peppercorn salad. Both unmemorable.  The shrimp (shocking I know) was absolutely covered with a pile of pickled relish.  What is up with all the vinegar???\n\nDessert was....odd. A flourless chocolate cake (about 1/2 inch thick) with about a 1 inch, thick, layer of sour cream custard that completely overpowered the cake. That, coupled with a roasted peach sauce left us thinking - why? \n\nWe had about three waiters revolving and serving us - which I find annoying. The end of our experience was topped off with a group of 7 young assholes cat-calling us from another table. What is this, Denny's???\n\nThe ONLY saving grace was the help of the Manager who proceeded to discount half of our bill. She told the table to shut the f*ck up and have some respect. She was pretty baddass and very, very apologetic. She promised they were usually on point - and comped us a round of Moonshine.  So to her - Thank You, much appreciated. I may actually come back to give her another chance - for her service and attitude about the entire thing, I gave an extra star.\n\nIt was really a bummer - we were on a girls weekend vacation, and were all really looking forward to ending it with a nice dinner at Cochon.

It's a bustling (definitely need a reservation), modern rustic looking place that oozes good energy. The food also performs - (mostly) authentic Cajun dishes prepared in a modern and highly skilled manner. Perhaps the best thing on the menu is their grits - a very large grind grit that almost has a fresh creamed corn flavor and texture. Their eponymous dish is a long braised pork dish with a few (wish there were more) cracklings on top. The redfish entree is as good as, if not better than anywhere else. For side dishes besides the grits, the green tomato and crawfish is good, not great; smothered collard greens are as expected; and the stewed limas were proclaimed totally authentic by the Cajun ladies sitting next to us. For starters, the fried pig ears are good, but missing the (hoped for) gelatinous chew - likely because they're thinly sliced and covered in too much fry batter. The fried boudin are nice, delicate and very soft meatballs - perhaps a bit too mild in flavor to stand up against the deep fry. Desserts are excellent - take your pick. All critique aside, you couldn't do much better in NOLA than having a meal (or two) at Cochon.

Enjoyed the experience overall, with just a few reservations.\n\nThe interior is an interesting kind of rustic moderne. The booths and tables are in the style of wooden benches, with some very unique lighting illuminating their backs. Overall, however, the place was far too loud and far too dark, so dark that it made it tough to identify the individual elements on my plate.\n\nService was friendly,very knowledgeable, and professional and the meal was well paced.\n\nAs for the food, we started out with the pig ears and the \"boucherie plate\", which is actually from a confusing menu section. What is the difference between \"boucherie\" and \"small plates\"? And why are they on separate sections of the menu? But I digress. The pig ears were paid. Cut into strips, breaded, and fried they could have been any deep fried Applebee's appetizer. The cane syrup mustard that came with it was fine, but did little to redeem an unremarkable dish. The boucherie plate, basically charcuterie, fared better. It featured hogshead cheese (a delicious headcheese with a wonderful salty, porky essence), fried hog jowls (like crispy bacon, but far too salty to be edible), \"rolled bacon\" (actually cured, similar to prosciutto or pancetta), pork rillette, and tasso ham. All, with the exception of the aforementioned hog jowels, were very good. \n\nI sampled the catfish courtbuillion, the pulled pork (inexplicably called the cochon on the menu), the ham hock, and the rabbit stew. The pulled pork was not BBQ style, and was instead incredibly moist and perfectly seasoned. The flavor just melted out of the meat. The cracklins, part of the accompaniments, were dry and did not add a whole lot to the dish. The ham hock, served with sweet potatoes and black eye pea broth (probably mostly ham stock) had a very interesting and pleasing combination of flavors. My rabbit & dumplings, actually a stew, was way over seasoned. The overwhelming spiciness ruined any other flavor it may have had. Once again another case of the meat in a dish being basically unidentifiable. The catfish courtbuillion was the clear star of the night, being just a perfect balance of flavor and texture. It was slightly spicy, but the spiciness was followed by some very full and well developed flavors. Thinking about it now makes me desperately hungry for it.\n\nSo, overall the experience was a decent one. As another commenter said, the food was just ok. I was expecting great leaps of creativity, but everything was just ok, especially considering the hype around this place.  Many items were pretty expensive, too, given the ingredients and preparation. I would visit the place again, however, if only to see how other items on the menu are.", "date": "2009-07-17 07:09:23"}

Now...they do handle the pig and their southern/creole offerings in a modern manner, which provides interest and novelty. \n\nThe interior is simple and interesting. There is a small bar and a \"chef's bar/table\" to watch the goings on in the kitchen. While the wine menu is weak, at best, they do have some intriguing southern offerings, like moonshines. Paying homage to picnic tables at BBQ joints, wooden slats create the sleek chairs and bench seating. A simple, large photo of a farm adorns one wall. All of this told me, \"it's about the food.\" \n\nHungry, we ordered the fried okra appetizer and the zucchini salad as starters. Yum, yum, yum. The okra was perfectly cooked and had a vinegar tinged ranch type dipping sauce. The zucchini salad was one of the best salads I've ever tasted in my life. Thin slices of zucchini tossed in a vinaigrette and topped with mint, parsley, pecans, goat cheese and onion. Awesome! \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the pork belly and the cochon. The cochon was the winner here. The pork belly was good, but not the best I've ever had and not nearly as juicy as it should be. When I think about N.O., I always remember my first pork belly experience at Commander's Palace years ago. This didn't come close. The cochon however, was delicious. Being from North Carolina, shredded pork is BBQ for me. This was an elevated version. The pulled pork is cooked in a skilled to char the \"patty.\"  Paired with turnips, cabbage, apples, greens and cracklings, I spiced it up with the Cochon hot sauce and vinegar in peppers on the table. The hot sauce was so good, we visited \"Butcher\" the next day to pick up a couple of bottles. As our side, we had the off menu potatoes and figs cooked with lard. OMG...if we had only eaten that Cochon would have 5 stars! Perfectly cooked potatoes and figs with the charred pieces of lard on top. Inventive and divine. \n\nFor dessert, we had the chicory & chocolate pot de creme with real whipped cream and sprinkles of cayenne pepper! Different, not too sweet, and a perfect end to the meal. \n\nMy friend ordered a Catdaddy moonshine to end the evening. It smelled and tasted like a cake donut. So interesting. \n\nFor southern food in a modern environment, head to Cochon. I would recommend reservations on a weekend evening and the service was fairly slow.", "date": "2009-07-21 16:51:52"}

The atmosphere is hip but humble, a good place for a mid-twenties birthday party, a casual date, or in our case, dinner for a family of five riding in from the airport in airport clothes.  The place gets busy, so make reservations to be safe.  Service is friendly and casual, a good match for the ambience.\n\nThe menu is adventurous and interesting, and we tried a few things we'd never tried before.  Even so, the overall presentation was homey and unpretentious.  The food wasn't mind-blowing, but it was pretty good.\n\nThe bread was of the soft tear-apart variety, much like Hawaiian bread, but with a great, salty, yeasty flavor.  For our appetizers we ordered the fried alligator with chili garlic aioli, the fried pig ears with cane syrup mustard, the wood-fired oyster roast, and a hen and andouille gumbo.  Alligator was a first for all of us, and while I was happy to check that off my list, I wasn't terribly impressed.  It really did taste like tough chicken, and the aioli overwhelmed the already artery-clogging dish with mayo.  The pig ears, another first, were much better.  They were surprisingly tender, and I enjoyed the fry-like presentation in a paper cone with yummy mustard sauce.  The oyster roast was great, very flavorful with good texture.  I love raw oysters, but these were different and not inferior.  The gumbo was good, though certainly not the best of our trip.  It was very salty with a dark roux.\n\nFor our entrees, we tried the smoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad, the Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage, and cracklins, the ham hock with sweet potatoes, pickled greens, and black eyed peas with ham broth, the rabbit and dumplings, and a deep-fried soft-shelled crab special.  We also got a side of creamy grits.  The ham hock was the clear winner with flavorful meat accompanied by creamy sweet potato and a nice tang from the pickled greens.  The cochon, in comparison, lacked juiciness.  The rabbit and dumplings came in a lovely, comforting stew, and the dumplings became progressively more toothsome as they soaked in the liquid.  The beef brisket was disappointing - the potatoes were cold and tasted like potato salad from a plastic tub.  The worst of the bunch was the soft-shelled crab.  It was enormously greasy, and all the succulence of crab got deep-fried into oblivion.  The grits were tasty, though the near-full plate at the end of our meal meant we had all decided they weren't worth the calories.\n\nWe weren't particularly impressed by the entrees, but we decided to indulge in dessert with good results.  Don't waste your time with the root bear float, which you can literally duplicate at home, but the peach cobbler with creme fraiche ice cream hits all the right notes.  The creme fraiche ice cream actually managed to convey the sweet tang of creme fraiche, a feat that I have seen attempted and failed on various occasions, and it elevated this rustic dessert with a trendy twist.  The cobbler was presented with gooey-soft sliced peaches and crumbly buttery biscuits on top.  It took restraint not to lick the bowl.  The homemade strawberry fig ice cream was also good, if a bit icy and not on the same level as the cobbler.\n\nAfter trying the better half of the Cochon menu, I can say that I enjoyed myself and tried several new things, but that the wow factor was missing from most of the dishes.  Still, it was a good time and I would recommend the place to those in search of a little novelty.", "date": "2009-09-02 06:09:43"}

Luckily, I made the right decision to go during lunch, so I still had dinner to make up for the shortfall. \n\nI ordered the ham hock with sweet potatoes, pickled greens, and black eyed pea ham broth. I should have known not to order a meal that is for the most part, a family tradition in my house hold. Especially around the holidays. That said, I had really high expectations. The ham hock did not offer enough flavor. The sweet potatoes lacked something, perhaps brown sugar, vanilla, or butter. I'm really not sure, but I was sorely disappointed. \n\nOn a positive note, the service was wonderful. My server was very knowledgeable and accommodating. \n\nIn my opinion, Cochon is overrated and overpriced. I would definitely not go back.", "date": "2009-10-29 04:08:52"}

The restaurant was fairly crowded, so my friends and I sat at the bar for our meal.  We ordered drinks (I partook of something I believe was called \"Joy Juice\" made from moonshine and vinegar) and proceeded to peruse the menu.\n\nSadly, one of my friends is an incredibly fastidious eater, and there wasn't much on the menu he would try.  We agonized over the options for a while.  Cochon has a number of small, tapas-like options to choose from.  Eventually we ordered a number of dishes and passed them around as people would try them.\n\nThis is where I need to rave about having eaten then best thing I've ever had in my life.  Bar none.  No hyperbole.  Zero exceptions.  Cochon basically means \"pig meat\".  On the menu: pork cheeks, something I'd heard was a true delicacy.  I tried them and was honestly bowled over by just how.....incredible they were.  I can only describe them as a million times better than the best pot roast you've ever had.  Tender as possible, and contained in a very light breading.  I'm drooling right now as I write this.  It was truly one of the best things I've ever consumed.\n\nSo after that, we also had alligator, okra, cucumbers, and their mac and cheese.  All of them were also exceptionally good, but nothing even came close to the cheeks.  The entire meal was just amazing and it was certainly the best food I had while in New Orleans.  If you're looking for an exceptional meal and especially if you like pork, I highly suggest giving Cochon a try.", "date": "2009-11-23 15:41:20"}

We started with the joy juice, which was a dangerously delicious moonshine-containing cocktail. I also sampled another orangey-bourbon cocktail that was quite tasty. They have an interesting bourbon list here, including flights, that I would definitely go for if I returned.\n\nFor food, I started with the crab-artichoke app. I LOVE blue crab, and this mix with tasty artichoke served in the top of a cleaned-out crab shell was fantastic! One of my companions got the alligator app, which I sampled--more breading/hot sauce than gator, but quite tasty all the same. For an entree I got the namesake cochon--deliciously spiced pulled-pork shaped into a patty and deep-fried; simply wonderful. Sides were tasty as well, with turnips, cabbage, and, of course, cracklins! Others got the ham hock and the brisket, both of which looked fantastic, and all were pleased with the offerings.

Although, I was able to get an 8:30 seating on a Saturday night when I called on a Thursday, it was Christmas week, apparently a slow time in New Orleans.", "date": "2010-01-02 04:14:35"}

We weren't seated until 10:30.\n-They were out of Pork Shoulder, the only pork entree on the menu. For a place with a pig on the sign, this was disappointing. \n-The fried Peanut-butter Banana pie desert was not very good--too fried, weird texture.  \n\nThe Pros:\nMost of the food was great.  Souffled grits with venison? Yum-O. Warm cabbage salad with hog jowls and goat cheese? Sign me up. The Boar sausage with saurkraut was surprisingly delish.  And the strawberry baked alaska was a nice way to end a meal.\n\nThe service was great-- we had 2 waitresses, both keeping an eye on us, and making conversation when time allowed.  We gave them a heads-up that we were hoping to get out by 11:30 or so, and they did their darnedest, and even managed to have a cab waiting for us when we were done (we couldn't even get through to a cab company on our cell phone, so this was quite a feat). \n\nDespite their efforts, we were stuck in traffic when the clock struck 12, and we missed the festivities.

From the lighting, to the brick exterior walls, to the bar, this packed place had to deliver a decent meal. I decided to take a spot at the kitchen counter so I didnt have to wait. I decided to sin boldly and ordered a \"Creole Downfall\" ($10) that had Virginia White Lightning corn likker, gingerale and mint. Wow, it packed a powerful punch.

The gumbo was a little atypical in terms of the roux but I loved the combination of black-eyed peas and the soft pork. The bread and hog head cheese was hard to put down too. For entrees, I watched the procession of plates living the kitchen either from the wood burning stove or the grill. Everything from oven roasted redfish ($24) to Rabbit and dumplings ($20), but I decided to try the namesake items which was Louisiana couchon with turnips, cabbage and cracklins. ($22).

I couldnt bare to try any of their $5 sides which included smothered greens, creamy grits, twice-baked potatoes, etc., because I wanted to leave room for dessert. I missed the special but was happy to choose between Mississippi Mud Cake, Banana Cream Pie, a Citrus Parfait and Pineapple Upside-Down cake for $7 a pop.

It whiskey based and an improvement, but not a great cocktail. The final dish was rabbit & dumplings. I salivate even now reminiscing about this fine dish. It is like a thick stew with biscuit like dumplings on top. It is got some great spices and hearty texture to it. Just a superb dish.\n\nExcellent service and fantastic food, I would stay away from the cocktails but you simply must have a meal here.", "date": "2010-03-08 19:50:37"}

And I believe that, until I do some traveling and explore restaurants in other cities. Picture The Ravenous Pig. But literally ten times more creative in both food and atmosphere. That is Cochon.\n\nLocated in the Warehouse district in NOLA, this place was absolutely hopping. All the tables were full when we arrived at 8:30, and all the tables were full when we left two hours later.\n\nFor my started I ordered the Mushroom Salad. If you haven't noticed, I've been on a bit of a mushroom kick recently. And this salad really quenched my thirst for the fungi. Tossed with lemons, hunks of fresh mint and parsley and fried beef jerky, this salad was fantastic. I have to admit that I've never thought about how delicious the flavors of beef jerky and lemon could be (really, who has?). But it was freaky good. It was a huge portion and with the rich earthiness of the mushrooms I was only able to eat about half.\n\nI ordered one of the specials for my entree....mainly because the server described it as a \"play on pork and beans\". Braised Pork Shoulder with Stewed Peanuts. Sounds crazy, yes? It was....crazy delicious! The pork was very tender and a perfect pairing with the soft-ish peanuts.

By the way, where was the spice?, I could've used it to push down those ribs.\n\n2)  Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage & cracklins:  This was the saltiest, most dried out pork i have ever tried.  it was so horrific i took just one bite.

I thought the aioli would come on the side, but the alligator was already dressed with it.  It was great.  Alligator does taste like chicken, but the aioli gave it that little kick that set it apart.\n\nI went twice, and this first time I had the smoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad.  The brisket was incredibly tender, but I would have liked to see a little less fat. One piece was almost all fat.  Still, the taste was excellent, and the sauce didn't overpower everything.  I am not a fan of potato salad, but I love horseradish; so, I didn't know what to expect.  I should not have worried, as the side was very good.\n\nWhen I returned the next day for lunch again I had the catfish courtbouillon.  Catfish never tasted so good, and that's saying something considering that catfish is a bottom-feeder.  It was all very good.\n\nService was excellent, except for the fact that they won't take an appetizer order (the alligator).  They have to take the entire order at once, according to our server.

New Orleans is a dynamite food city, but it's not exactly a vegetarian's paradise. Throughout the weekend, his diet consisted of red beans and rice, beignets, burritos and Subway...but his best meal undoubtedly came at a placed named for pig.  That exemplifies the food generally at Cochon--everything whether meat or veg was locally inspired, unique, and delicious.\n\nAt first I was a little skeptical b/c the place looked and felt trendy. It was packed on a saturday night and there was a pretty lively bar scene. Locals, families, young professionals, southern belles and bobs, and our merry group of 9 made up for a pretty diverse clientele, and we all enjoyed Cochon's equally diverse drink list. Then my skepticism quickly disappeared once the food started arriving.\n\nIt all started with one of the greatest dinner rolls I've ever had the pleasure to begin a meal with--these warm, soft, pillowy, and complimentary clouds were literally glistening, and our group of nine went through at least 5 baskets worth. \n\nThen came our appetizers: first, fried gator with chili garlic aioli.  In all my life, I had never tasted gator and then one weekend in NOLA and I had it twice. Cochon's version was similar to a rock shrimp tempura with chili mayo appetizer that you'd find in a lot of japanese restaurants...except that gator doesn't taste like shrimp but a combination of frog and chicken. The gator was fried crispy and there was a good enough chunk of meat--a perfect balance of familiarity and exotic meat. The onion and grit casserole was really creamy but my veg friend could probably tell you more as he wolfed most of it down. Also, we got our first taste of \"cochon\" through the fried boudin balls. These had the size and appearance of falafel, and were meaty and starchy at the same time as they had a flavorful combo of what i think was sausage and rice. \n\nFinally came the piece de resistance: Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage and cracklins. The way our waitress described it, the cochon was pulled pork that was shaped together, seared and pan fried to create a crispy texture on the outside.  To me, it was a hockey puck full of juicy, crispy, succulent strands of pork. The accompanying turnips and cabbage livened up the dish and provided me with my only serving of vegetable that day. But the pork, combined with perfectly crunchy cracklins (is there any better word for food than cracklin?) clearly took home the bacon: an inspired signature dish for an amazing restaurant devoted to pig. One that even a vegetarian would enjoy.", "date": "2010-05-26 05:18:02"}

This is undeniable in the warm familial atmostphere and stunning bites that define Cochon.\n\nI LOVE food but occasionally when I open a menu and see items that have been served up SO BADLY, SO OFTEN I shudder at the thought of trying said things again (see alligator often too tough to swallow much less use for anything other than a fleshy baseball OR Boudin often so dry and just horribly gamey it is inedible) but I was heading to Cochon with a group of 5th generation cajuns and it was a Link eatery so I dove in...and we were all thrilled we did.\n\nGET A RESERVATION. This is not optional. No reservation? Unless it is the middle of summer with 180% humidity and everyone has left town you won't get a seat.\n\nThe local liquor selection is divine. They usually carry at least 4 Abita's on draft at any given time. The bartenders there are true mixologists and will not steer you wrong. Don't know what to drink with your dinner? Ask them. They know exactly the perfect compliment.\n\nThe fried alligator with Garlic aioli was like a bit of \"fried fried heaven\" in my mouth. The alligator was firm but not tough and the seasoning scrumptious. The boudin with the mustard and pickled peppers looked a bit tart to me on paper but turned out to be a revelation when served. The rabbit and dumplings was just one of the most amazing things I have ever put in my mouth EVER. It was so fresh tasting with the veggies and the rabbit was fall apart tender. The brisket was almost obscene it was so good with the smokey, seasoning playing perfectly against the kick of the horseradish in the potato salad.\n\nIt was beautifully executed, lacking the snobbery and just simple, brilliantly paired food that was clearly created by someone who loves Louisiana cuisine. Is it a bit \"much\"? HELL YES! But isn't that by definition what New Orleans is all about. It is a celebration of excess and it succeeds perfectly!\n\nI could eat here everyday. I am sure I would die young with all the butter that is notorious in cajun cooking but damn it if it were being served by Cochon I can promise you I would also die happy in one of my favorite eateries on the planet in my favorite city in the world.. \n\nAlways hungry...and Sadly STILL stuck and lost in LA.\nGG", "date": "2010-06-01 22:20:25"}

Fried alligator was tender and delicious -- deep fried chunks of anything with a spicy aioli is hard to mess up.  Heavy casserole of eggplant & bread crumbs.  Spicy wood-fired oysters, ribs...OK.  Salad of sliced raw mushrooms, something-jerky with mint and parsley was confusing but I was dying for something green, fresh or crisp so I ate half of it.

Will my review be lost in the sea of 5 star reviews? It doesn't matter, I need to spread the word. \n\nCochon, run by the famed chef Donald Link - a James Beard award winner - is a must visit when you are in New Orleans. The food is both delectable and innovative. Deep fried rabbit livers anyone? While you are at it, why don't you try the fried pigs ears with cane syrup mustard, and the paneed pork cheeks with peanuts?\n\nI had to try a couple of cocktails after reading their specialty cocktail list. Started with The Boss Hog - Jr. Johnson's midnight moon Carolina Moonshine, cucumber vodka, fresh watermelon juice, and limeade. Summer was served in a cocktail glass. I then moved on to Catahoula Hound Dog  - Citadell gin, lemon bitters, homemade blueberry syrup, and muddled lime. Summer came again, this time in my pants (oops, excuse me!). They also have five kinds of root beer, 15 Bourbons, and a variety of beers. \n\nI wanted to try everything on the menu. However, I left my spare stomach at home, so I had to settle for only a few items. Started off with the fried rabbit livers. Deep fried rabbit livers served on toast smeared with pepper jelly. Utterly divine! This set the stage for a great meal to follow.\n\nI then ordered the wood fired oysters. Oysters on the half shell roasted in a wood even, sprinkled with a spicy (chilli?) oil. Good lord! Perfect blend of the oyster saltiness with spiciness of the sprinkled oil. \n\nAt this point I decided to forgo entrees and order more appetizers. My dining companions ordered different items from the entree list. Next orders for me were the fried alligator and tomato stuffed with crab. Tossed in chili garlic aioli, the fried alligator was consumed in about 2 minutes flat. Scrumptious! The crab stuffed tomato - half a beefsteak tomato stuffed with crabmeat, drizzled with garlic pullman and roasted in a wood oven. Simple yet delectable. \n\nTwo of my dining companions ordered the famous rabbit with dumplings. It is served in a cast iron pan. Hearty and filling, this is a must for any rabbit meat lover. I also tasted the fired pigs ears and paneed pork cheeks. made me wish I had a second stomach like a cow so I can store all this deliciousness. Greedy much?\n\nThere was no room for dessert after this wonderful meal. I will save it for the next visit. Service was spot on. We never felt rushed or neglected.\n\nPlaces like Cochon make me believe in the art of great food. Cheers to chef Donald Link.", "date": "2010-09-02 15:12:01"}

It's impossible to visit and not eat well and copiously. And that we did. So much so that by our final dinner at Cochon, I was unable to try everything on the menu that I wanted to.\n\nThe Angelenos out there will understand when I say Cochon is like the Animal of the south. A celebration of not only the pig, but of all things meat. For the rest of you, Cochon is Chef Donald Link and Chef Stephen Stryjewski's modern Cajun restaurant that has been the buzz of New Orleans in recent years. Housed in a converted warehouse in the Warehouse District, the contemporary-rustic space is all handcrafted wooden tables and chairs, exposed brick and concrete floors. It boasts an in-house boucherie, Cochon Butcher, that turns whole pigs into boudin, andouille, smoked bacon, and head cheese, and a wood burning oven turning out roasted oysters, beef brisket and suckling pig. Rounding out the produce are locally caught seafood and regional bourbons and beers.\n\nNeed more convincing? How about the 2007 James Beard award for Best Chef: South for Donald Link and Best New Restaurant nomination for Cochon? How about oyster and meat pie, fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly toast, wood-fired oyster roast, fried alligator with chili garlic aioli, fried boudin with pickled peppers, spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle, fried pigs ears with cane syrup mustard, paneed pork cheeks with pickled green tomatoes?\n\nChoosing only five plates from the menu is like walking into a brothel with only 50 bucks. An exercise in frustration.\n\nBut a mouth watering frustration, nonetheless.\n\nChoose we did. We started with the oyster and meat pie and the arugula salad with pumpkin calas, pecan and tasso bacon. The oyster and meat pie was more what I'd think of as a pasty than a pie but, semantics aside, it was good. The baked shell had a good crunch and the filling, although not strong on the flavor of oyster, was satisfyingly meaty. A great snack with a beer.\n\nWhich, luckily, I had on hand. Lazy Magnolia's Indian Summer Spiced Ale. The orange and coriander notes were pronounced, making it quite a floral beer. I have to look out for this in LA. Delicious.\n\nI conceded one dish to a salad for the girl. The aforementioned arugula salad with pumpkin calas, pecan and tasso bacon. I let her eat the arugula. I ate the deep fried pumpkin fritters. I like to compromise.\n\nNext up was the fried alligator with chili garlic aioli. The last time I had alligator was in a Vietnamese restaurant and it was heavily sauced. I don't think I'd ever had a true taste of alligator. I can report back that it tastes like chewy pork. Still, it's hard to go wrong with even deep fried chewy pork with a sweet chili garlic sauce.\n\nWe followed that with, unsurprisingly, more deep fried meat. The fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly toast. Now, I'm a big fan of liver, mainly in the form of chicken livers, duck livers and, of course, foie gras. These rabbit livers were far more mild in taste than chicken or duck livers. Dressed with onion and cilantro and served on a thin slice of crispy pastry-like toast with a sweet pepper jelly, this was my favorite plate of the night. Again, a great interplay of fried crunch, gamey flavors and a sweet sauce.\n\nWe rounded out our small tasting with the paneed pork cheeks with pickled green tomatoes, apples and peas. Tender, as expected, and lightly breaded and pan fried. The pickled green tomatoes and apples added tartness, the peas and rice the cheeks sat on the starch. The most substantial of the small plates we ordered, and perhaps the most complete dish.\n\nUnfortunately we left no room for dessert but the pineapple upside down cornmeal cake with coconut-lime sorbet and dulce de leche sounded tempting. Next time.\n\nBesides, the night was still young (well, by New Orleans standards) and we had more adventures planned for our final night.\n\nMore local delicacies to sample.\n\nNow, where was that 50 bucks?", "date": "2010-09-03 09:11:55"}

The majority of the items here are made in-house from pig, although there are plenty of other options should you not think the swine is divine.    Personally, my choice for the last meat on earth would be bacon, so I opted for the pork shoulder (amazing melt in your mouth goodness) and the special arugula salad with fried goat cheese and house cured bacon made from pork tenderloin.   Both were absolutely amazing.   Since you are in New Orleans, I would strongly recommend you try the gumbo, which I'd guess doesn't get ordered here much but was fantastic.   The boudin appetizer and side dishes (greens and creamy grits) were also fantastic.   Full bar + infused moonshine (yum) along with several local draft beers.    \n\nService was strong and friendly and pricing is very reasonable for what you are getting.

We had eaten at Broussard's the evening prior, and I figured I'd find a place that would provide a contrast to some of the formal dining we had enjoyed the night before.  After reading several reviews, Cochon appeared to fit the bill perfectly.\n\nAlthough it was fairly easy to make a reservation just a few hours before dinner time, I was pleasantly surprised to find that when I arrived, the place was packed and really kicking.  The vibe was great, and the ambiance could be described as modern, yet inviting, and just the right blend of casual and formal.\n\nFirst up were a couple of drinks, and I had a specialty cocktail made with Gin (yes!), lemon bitters, blueberry infused simple syrup, and a lime wedge.  I really enjoyed this cocktail, although it could have been less sweet, but this is the South.\n\nOf course, we ordered the fried alligator, boudin, and roasted oysters.  I'd skip on the oysters next time, and focus on that boudin for sure.  What a great tasting sausage!  The fried alligator had an interesting texture, on the tough side for sure, but the flavor was great and definitely worth a try even if just for the novelty.\n\nI perused the entrees on the menu, and quickly settled on the Cochon, which is perhaps one of the most tender chunks of pulled pork shoulder that I have ever sank my teeth into.  It was truly amazing.  Everyone in my group was in a sharing mood, so we sampled each other's dishes, which included a delectable red fish, rabbit, beef brisket, and goat.  Besides my cochon dish, the beef brisket was something to write home about, and the red fish was a close 3rd place.  The entrees stole the show at this restaurant.\n\nThe desserts did not seem to be a strong point here, yet they managed to be quite palatable and enjoyable.  I ordered a fried peach pie with cinnamon ice cream.  The pie shell and chunky fruit filing was good, and the cinnamon ice cream was delicious on its own, but I felt that its nuanced flavor profile was overwhelmed by the pie.\n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful dining experience at Cochon and it was a nice change of pace for sure.

I had a couple bites of my girlfriend's cochon.  If you like carnitas, you will LOVE the cochon. Crisp on the outside, moist on the inside and flavor from the heavens above. I might sound like I'm hyping it up, but I assure you I'm giving this dish justice. I am getting hungry right now reminiscing about it. \n\n4. The chocolate-peanut butter pie (or cake?). VERY heavy but yummy for those who enjoy peanut butter. Anyone who can eat this completely on his/her own deserves a prize. I thankfully had a partner helping me out and we still left a bite or two on the plate- it was THAT filling.  \n\nHeck, the entrees were big portions too.

The first thing was that at a restaurant named for a pig, they ran out of the pork shoulder dish.  That was kind of a bummer since it was the only pork option that night.  The venison with grits and the boar sausage dishes were both great.  One of the best parts was the service.  We had two waitresses who did everything that they could to get us out before midnight, including getting us a cab on a night when I could not even get through on the phone all night.

The light sauce and beans ontop were icing, the whole construction a marvel of gastronomic engineering. I will not soon forget that piece of alchemy, oh no.\n\nI don't think there's a bad thing at Cochon and I've heard the sandwiches  at the butcher shop are unreal but we spent our afternoon in the restaurant. The ham hock was screaming good, I think it was even better than the louisiana cochon which is pork shoulder cooked slow then turned into a small patty, and fried so it slightly resembles a good carnitas, crispy ends on slow stewed meat, but completely different color taste etc. \n\nThe aligator bits were deep fried in a batter I want to bathe in and then deep fry myself so I can gname on my fingers. The oysters, oh the oysters, they were not an overwhelming small plate of garlic but rather a fabulous blend of garlic to sauce to bivalve. The grits with the yard eggs and mushrooms were an artful take on a staple of southern cooking. \n\nThe one place where the restaurant needs serious help is the bar. The drinks are uninteresting, poorly constructed, here's a tip, try a measuring cup or spoon. Either there's too much alcohol or too much sugar, or sometimes both! After having a drink on the menu we stuck to the beer. If they got the bar in shape and brought in some real mixology I think this joint would be a force to be reckoned with. As it is, you can't go wrong with the boucharie plate of house cured meats, and on the strength of butchery and work with the flesh I can't justify dinging them for the bar, it's just that damn good.", "date": "2010-11-03 02:08:15"}

The mac and cheese was and is everything I look for in mac and cheese. It was creamy, but not too thick. It was cheesy but not overwhelmingly cheesy. It had the perfect amount of cheesy crusty goodness on top. Everything was to die for. I wish I had room for dessert, but I had to pop a couple Rolaids right after devouring almost all six dishes. \n\nThe only issue I have with this restaurant is the acoustics.

In this day and age a restaurant as hyped and successful as Cochon needs to bring it up a notch.  Syrupy, over sugared cocktails are just not acceptable.

Rabbit Livers!  Yes!  Now when I was younger we had this amazing pet rabbit named Lucky Star.  Cutest little albino rabbit you ever did see.  Lived a good long time and was part of the family.  Good thing for Lucky Star that I never had livers cooked this way when I was little or he may not have had such a long and comfortable existence.  \n\nWe had an amazing salad that contained an breaded and fried egg, that once you broke open oozed with a perfect warm yolk.  Mixed perfectly with the bacon, dressing and spinach.  This was stellar!  \n\nThe Cochon itself was very well done, had great flavor and was a big hit.\n\nWe had visited an oyster bar before heading over and had gotten a little carried away, so unfortunately no dessert for us this time.

My first try of boudin was from here, and while the rice component was interesting, the sausage was delicious and made for an interesting breaded fried sausage ball appetizer.

I could even pass over the somewhat over smokiness of the meat since it made everything delicious, including the greens.  \n\nOne unique offering this place has was the aperitif offerings, especially their moonshine flights.

Not sure why it was served on a bed of rock salt, which seems pointless and wasteful, but it didn't affect the taste.\n\nFried alligator with spicy ailoi -- unevenly breaded and the breading was falling off.  Alligator meat was tougher than usual, and the aoili was too salty by a mile.  I was surprised that the fried bits were tossed in the aioli instead of being served with the aioli on the side.  It'd be like ordering calamari and having them toss the rings with the cocktail/marinara sauce for you.  1 star dish at a mostly decent establishment.\n\nShrimp and eggplant cornbread dressing -- I love stuffing/dressing, especially with cornbread.  Great idea, good work on the flavors, but agian too heavy on the salt.  Also, terrible on texture.  It was just mush, the cornbread pieces in dressing should stand up and maintain some structure, but it may as well have been purreed.  Tone down the salt and don't overmix it and you'll have a winning dish, Cochon.\n\nPoached yard egg and roasted mushroom on grits -- Delightful.  The grits were served as a pressed square cake and were light, buttery, and had great texture.  Perfectly seasoned, nicely crisp on the outside, and creamy inside.  My  first time having grits served like this, though I guess its just like how many people do polenta.  The poached egg was good, runny  yolk, and the mushrooms and mushroom gravy were a nice counterpoint to the buttery grits. 5 star dish.\n\nDesserts were pretty good, the highlight was the pineapple upside-down pancake.\n\nVery wide range of dish quality at one establishment, but more good than bad.", "date": "2010-12-05 15:09:19"}

After perusing Yelp and other food articles, I saw Cochon mentioned a few times.  Either they have good food or good marketing or perhaps both, but it had my attention, and having the name \"pig\" was another motivating factor.\n\nI tried booking reservations via Opentable but was not successful.  It said no reservations were available.  I then tried Cochon's website and filled out its online reservation inquiry form.  I was called back that same day and got a reservation.  First word advice, don't stop at Opentable looking for reservations.  I made reservations about 4 days in advance.  \n\nIt was nice that it was outside of the French Quarter in an area I would not have otherwise visited.  It's located in somewhat of an industrial area.  My friends and I did the 1-mile trek from the French Quarter there.\n\nIt's a casual restaurant with modern, minimal decor.  We ordered a couple of cocktails.  I got the Hillbilly.  I was warned that it was spicy.  I took a sip, it initially made me cough.  I was not expecting the peppery spiciness.  It reminded me of a bloody mary.  If you like a spicy, savory cocktail, then you might enjoy it, but it wasn't for me.  It didn't taste bad.  I just didn't like it much.\n\nFor starters/first course we ordered: the fried livers, charbroiled oysters, fried alligator, gumbo, and a green salad.  It all tasted delicious: some more memorable than not.  The fried alligator, gumbo and oysters were among the more memorable. \n\nFor entrees my husband ordered the pork loin and I got the rabbit and dumplings. The pork dish had a nice balance of sweet and savory and my rabbit was comforting.  \n\nDespite how full I was we still ordered dessert for the table.  Dessert did not disappoint - full of Southern, fatty charm!  We ordered the pumpkin/pecan pie and the key lime pie: rich, fatty goodness that was worth risking my ability to get into a dress for the wedding.\n\nMinor complaint - the waitstaff while extremely attentive bordered on excessively attentive.  We were asked about 3-4x how everything was during each course.  That means we were interrupted about a dozen times during our dinner to ask how we were doing.  I like when the staff comes by to check on us, but it got annoying after the 6th or so time.", "date": "2010-12-09 23:54:15"}

It was a rainy day and this was just what I needed. It was rich in flavor, studded with sausage and chicken. Man, was it good. \n\nNot wanting to commit to just one entree, I cobbled a meal together by ordering two apps: the fried boudin and the meat pie. The boudin was delicious. The loose sausage was rolled with rice into balls, then battered and fried to a crisp. \n\nThe empanada-like meat pie was also a great choice. Flaky on the outside and wonderfully unctuous on the inside, it was a filling -- and pleasing -- dish. Much like the gumbo, both of these were perfect for a stormy Tuesday. \n\nNova, conversely, probably had too little to eat. She ordered the smoked brisket with potato salad.

As it turns out, a stop at Cochon is a must if you are making a culinary tour of NoLa. \n\nOur group made a quick stop, ordering only entrees. Of the small plates we considered, the fried alligator and fried green tomatoes looked most promising. Instead, we went straight to the good stuff and dined on the mustard-crusted ham hock ($19), the rabbit and dumplings ($20), beef brisket ($19) and Louisiana cochon ($22). The rabbit was overwhelmed by the citrus-y sauce, though the meat itself was juicy and tender. The beef brisket had a lightly smoky flavor, also juicy and tender; we would have preferred more smokiness in the sauce, but overall very tasty. This was complemented nicely with the horseradish potato salad, which had a nice tang from the horseradish without completely dominating the dish. The strengths of the restaurant's signature dish include the cracklings and the sauteed greens; unfortunately, the meat itself was dry. \n\nThe highlight of the evening was, by far, the mustard-crusted ham hock. The ham itself has a crisp crust, which contrasts well with the tender meat that flakes off the bone. Though a tad salty (still drinking water as I type), it pairs well with the vinegary, tart greens and the creamy black eyed peas. I can't wait to remake this at home!\n\nService at Cochon was better than what we have witnessed so far in New Orleans (granted, we walked in at 6pm on a Monday night). We were seated immediately without a reservation and were out the door by 7:15 without feeling rushed. Food arrived promptly and water service and empty plates were taken care of immediately.\n\nFinal breakdown: +3 stars for excellent entrees, +1.5 stars for excellent service.

No one checked on us for water, if we needed a refill, and if we wanted to order anything else as we sat and talked.\n\nThe good: Amazing food.  Different food then the other restaurants we visited all week so it shook up our taste buds and wow.  The roasted oysters are different the Drago or Bourbon House.  All three are great but having these that was more butter and garlic and no cheese was a great change.  The pork pate was amazing (part of the meat plate that day).\n\nA short walk from the WW II museum so a great lunch if you plan to visit the museum.", "date": "2011-01-02 20:53:54"}

The Deviled Crab with Butter Crackers was warm, creamy and you can actually taste the pieces of crab. The Fried Alligator with Chili Garlic Aioli was crispy and the meat tasted like the breast meat of (I hate to say it )chicken. The sauce was very special, but don't count your calories if you are going to try this dish. Of course we also tried the Fried Boudin which was better than most boudin, but what made it taste even better was probably because it was fried.

The cochon wasn't as juicy as I had hoped, but I could have eaten the veggies for days. We also ordered their special for the day Duck Confit, let just say scrumptious!

The prices are not the cheapest for lunch (b/c they basically use the dinner menu all day), but the food is delicious! I didn't mind a little splurge, all things considered.\n\nFirst thing's first: THE ROLLS. Oh my Lord, the rolls! Imagine the little ready-to-bake dinner rolls your mother made you when you were a kid (only in my mother's case, they were the rolls she used to BURN for me when I was a kid) . . . now imagine they are NOT the cheap & dirty variety, and that they are really squishy and doughy.

I knew I wanted to order the poached yard egg with roasted mushrooms & grits, but when I asked the cute little server if that would be enough, he said a side of macaroni & cheese casserole would probably be a good idea. So I went with that.\n\nThe poached egg with roasted mushrooms & grits = UH-MAZING. My only complaint is that they literally drowned it in green onions, and not being an onion fan at all, I had to spend a great deal of time picking them off with my fork (I just couldn't handle it . . . there were so many! It was embarrassing, but yes, I'm that picky. To a debilitating degree.). Once I got the green onion situation under control, the dish was decadent and delicious. That yolk was bright yelllow and pretty runny, which is fine with me. I'm sure they would customize that if you like a firmer yolk, but you would have to specify. The grits were more like a grit cake, and the mushrooms were layered underneath the egg. The whole thing was topped off with something resembling a meuniere sauce. \n\nMy cute little server overestimated the size of my stomach, so I ended up having to box up almost all of the macaroni & cheese casserole . . . but not before having a quick bite! Holy flippin' YUM. I know they use cheddar in there, but there are other cheeses in there I couldn't quite identify, but added a fantastic bite to the dish! \n\nPortions are small, but filling.

The variety was great and none of the cuts were too salty.\n\nCourse two consisted of headcheese, breaded and fried covered in lima beans and a minty cream sauce. Though you weren't able to get the full gelatinous glory of the head cheese, the contrast with the sauce made this my favorite dish of the meal. We also ordered this braised rib and rice thing, I forget the name but the rice cake was really excellent.\n\nFinally we had the cochon which was honestly disappointingly dry. I'm giving Cochon the benefit of the doubt that they just messed up this one order of their namesake and that if I were to return, and I certainly intend to, that it'll be moister. Still, even try if you ate it with the cabbage it was served on, it was still quite good.", "date": "2011-02-07 21:35:57"}

He grew up in Louisiana, left for SF, went to culinary school, returned to his New Orleans roots to open restaurants. Local boy does good. \n\nThe pig-themed Cochon is what I would describe as cajun with a fine dining twist. \n\nWe arrived a bit before our reservation time so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks from the cocktail menu. With names like The Swinekiller, Hillbilly Mary and Louisiana Hayride, the cocktails incorporated local flavors into intriguing blends. I spied large canning jars full of what looked like cherries and upon inquiry was told they were indeed house made maraschino cherries made by with local cherries and cooked down in maraschino liquor. Our bartender explained that the chef makes tons of these cocktail garnishes during the summer when cherries are in season and by the end of winter/early spring they near the end of their supply. He obliged my curiosity and gave us each a sample of the crimson red cherry. Boozy delicious. \n\nFortified with cocktails, we started our meal with the fried alligator with chili garlic aioli. Big pieces of gator dipped in the piquant aioli was a nice combo. I was expecting the meat to be tough, but was glad I was incorrect in my assumption. \n\nNext we moved on to the boudin. After a little research I discovered that boudin is a truly cajun country classic. Much like chorizo or sausage stuffed with rice and other cajun spices, boudin is ubiquitous. Cochon's version was much different than what we later tried at a truck stop in cajun country and was served with house pickled peppers. \n\nThe mushroom salad with lemon was out of this world. Thinly sliced shrooms lightly dressed with herbs and citrus was a dish that lightened things up after the boudin and fried alligator. \n\nFor my entree I tried the signature dish, the cochon, which can best be described as a ball of tender pulled pork topped with cracklins. Talk about pork overload. \n\nThe oven roasted gulf fish served fisherman's style came to the table hole with the skin on and was perfectly prepared. \n\nCochon seems to be a nuevo NOLA way to experience cajun food and although I have no idea about what constitutes \"good\" cajun food, our experience at Cochon was good enough for this cajun-deprived West Coaster.", "date": "2011-02-13 23:49:01"}

The problem in all of it is that she didn't read all of the reviews carefully and in our ignorance did not know that this place served pork products, something one of my other friends does NOT eat.  Fortunately there was plenty of options to choose from that worked in our favor.  \n\nThe restaurant was packed, ran into some colleagues since I was in town for a conference and was able to say hello.  Promptly seated and the waitress was great about explaining and answering our questions.  I opted for the smoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad and an extra side order of macaroni and cheese.  So I'm an idiot but so what of it.  I HATE horseradish, but in the moment the brisket sounded like it would hit the spot and that's why I got the extra side of macaroni and cheese.  I was hoping for a small hint of horseradish, but it was strong.  If you mix it in with the sauce from the brisket which falls apart with the fork then I somewhat enjoyed the potato salad, otherwise I left it alone.  The brisket was tender, tasty and falls apart so beautifully in your mouth! A great dish even if I didn't care for the horseradish.  The macaroni and cheese had a nice crunchy crust followed by creamy goodness under the surface.  I LOVED that dish.  Being in New Orleans, I had the Abita Amber beer, a nice dark beer with great body and flavor.  I really enjoyed it.  We were stuffed from dinner so we didn't even touch dessert.  My friends enjoyed their dishes as well.  The non-pork eater had a fish dish which was flaky and flavorful.  All the dishes were good and we were glad we could trust the Yelp reviews.

Probably the best oysters I've ever eaten.  Fried gator was okay.  I was disappointed that the batter kept falling off of the meat and there was definitely something missing in the aoili, maybe it needed some spice cause it was bland.

Also, there was no pork belly on the menu. This made me sad. \n\nDessert was my favorite part of the meal.  The carrot cake is extremely huge and the candied nuts on it were the best part.

Chef Link is a genius in the kitchen, and we're big fans of Herbsaint, too. On our last visit we had the boucherie plate, and I agree with Annalise P., as this is some of the best charcuterie I've had also. We eat barbecue all over the country, and his grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle are worth the visit alone, and some of the most succulent ribs we've ever had. We liked verything we tried, from the fried boudin balls to the pickled pork tongue, and their signature dish, the cochon with turnips, cabbage and cracklins..well, my husband ordered it on both of our visits, and was speechless both times. I had the rabbit & dumplings on our first visit, and was loathe to share. I like the way the menu is set up, so you can order smaller plates and try more food. Service was an issue here on our first visit. We were approached by a server and asked for a beverage order, and we both ordered water. Then we were approached and asked again by another server, and when we said that we'd already been asked, and someone else was waiting on us, she explained that they tag team tables here, and we may be waited on by a few people. Not team service, mind you, where everyone has a designated role, but a rather confusing stlye of service wherein, if you look like you need something, someone will ask. Sometimes we were smothered in service, and sometimes we were left hanging, with no one person responsible for our table.  I don't like repeating myself, and had to a couple of times, so was irritated with the service here. This is my only gripe, and it wasn't an issue on our second visit, but it was much busier, and the table ordered drinks, so we looked taken care of. I hope they've changed this, and I plan to find out, many times, as I revisit this gem.", "date": "2011-03-27 16:22:48"}

I scoured all the reviews from other Yelpers with vegetarian friends and decided to call ahead and warn them about the vegetarian situation 2 hours before our reservation. Unfortunately, my vegetarian coworker was not feeling well so she canceled last minute and we were not able to test out Cochon's ability/willingness to accommodate vegetarians. \n\nNow it was just down to me and one of my coworkers. The two of us arrived about 10 minutes before our 7:30 reservation and weren't seated until 10 minutes after our reservation. Considering the crowd, I guess that wasn't too bad. I got a drink special called the Cajun Cannon while we waited. It was a tasty, fruity-flavored champagne that I'd definitely get again.\n\nOnce seated, we were greeted by Reno, one of the most enthusiastic waiters I've had in a looong while. He described the daily specials like he was about to run back to the kitchen and cook them himself! All in all, fantastic service.\n\nFor appetizer, we ordered the (1) wood-fired oyster roast and (2) fried boudin with pickled peppers. The oysters were good but one of them had a ton of sand in it. I'm not sure I can blame the restaurant for oysters eating sand though. The fried boudin was just ok, really not special.\n\nAs entrees, I got (3) the oven roasted gulf fish \"fisherman's style\" and my coworker went with the (4) Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage & cracklins. My \"gulf fish\" turned out to be Louisiana Redfish and it was pretty good in some parts, but pretty fishy in other parts. The portion was large, but I'm not sure that could excuse fishy fish when we're in this close to the water. My coworker's pork was superb and I assumed it was the house specialty, considering the restaurant seems to be named after it. Even if I'm totally making that up, it was a better choice than my fish.\n\nFor dessert, we got the (5) pineapple upside-down cake as recommended by Reno. The cake was a tad dry and too dense for my taste but they do a pretty good job of supplying you with caramel sauce and key lime ice cream on the side to help with that issue. The key lime ice cream should be a dessert by itself. I wish I could buy a pint of it and keep it in my freezer for \"emergencies\". If you're female, you know what ice cream emergencies are like. If you're male, then most likely you have been the victim of an ice cream emergency at some point so you should also know what I'm talking about.\n\nOur total for 2 apps, 2 entrees, a dessert, and 1 beer = $108 after tip.

My drink was awesome.  I was afraid it would be a little too sweet with the OJ, but they use fresh squeezed and it perfectly balanced the whiskey.  More please!\n\nFor an appetizer we got the fried boudin with pickled peppers and the fried alligator.  The fried boudin was WOW!  How can you not like pork and rice, rolled in a ball, battered and fried?  I don't know what spices they use, but my mouth was dancing with joy!  The alligator was a little heavily sauced for me and also a little tough, but it still tasted okay.\n\nGregg M got the cochon with turnips, cabbage and cracklin.

The girlfriend and I wanted to culminate a great weekend in a great city with a great meal.  Following the advice of savvy locals, we decided to go to Cochon.  As an aside, I've been told by a friend (Jenn H, this means you) that I slaughter the pronunciation of the word \"cochon\".  Well, I may not know how to speak French, but I do know good food and Cochon, no matter how you say it, has damn good food!\n\nIt was prime time and we didn't have reservations.  We were willing to sit at the bar, which had a couple of open seats and were seated immediately.  We started off with a couple of their house original cocktails.  I had the Yellowjacket, a satisfying whiskey-based cocktail.  I wish I remembered everything that was in it, but it was a winner!  The GF had the Orange Whiskey, another solid offering.  \n\nFor our food choices, we started with the Fried Boudin with pickled peppers and the Fried Alligator with chili garlic aioli appetizers.  The boudin was wonderful, a perfectly fried pork ball.  Savory, meaty, yet surprisingly light.  A great start!  Unfortunately, the fried alligator was a slight misstep.  While nicely fried, leaving the meat tender, I thought it was over-breaded resulting in it falling off of the gator meat onto the plate instead of making it intact into my mouth.  I also felt the gator was over-sauced with the aioli.  Still a tasty offering, but not executed as well as the boudin.  However, our entrees both hit the ball out of the park!  The Louisiana Cochon with turnips, cabbage and cracklins was a pork tour de force.  Imagine a pan-fried (?) crab cake, but make it with a tender, spicy, and flavorful pulled-pork, and you have the Louisiana Cochon.  The turnips, cabbage, and cracklins were pleasing accompaniments to the meat.  The girlfriend's Oyster & Bacon Sandwich was so simple in concept and presentation, yet beautiful in its simplicity and flavor.  \n\nWe perused the dessert menu, saw several promising selections, but we were full after our pig feast.  Tyler persuaded us to give the Catdaddy moonshine (yeah, MOONSHINE) a try as an after dinner digestif.  Truth be told, I was skeptical, but this corn liquor had a subtle sweetness and possessed vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg notes.  It was a real surprise and a great finale to an enjoyable meal. \n\nIn summation, service was 5-stars...food and drink was 4.5-stars, rounding up to 5-stars! Cochon is a must for anyone who loves good food and pig!", "date": "2011-04-12 01:04:41"}

The deviled egg and cream really contrasts the flavors well. Great flavors.\nFried alligator: not overly fried. Tastes like chicken, but a little gamier, to be expected if you've had alligator before.\nCrawfish pie: subtle flavors, unfortunately the crust and fillings cover up the taste of the crawfish. Not much spice, I would pass over this.\n\nAll in all, a great experience and definitely a must visit if you are on the area. It also smells amazingly good inside.", "date": "2011-04-21 22:03:22"}

We had a 7pm reservation on a Saturday night.  When we arrived at 7:10, we were told that they were waiting for those still seated at \"our table\" to get up but that we could get a drink at the bar while waiting.  Fine.  During the next 25 minutes we spent waiting, there were several \"other\" tables that were cleared and awaiting the next seating, but these were not offered to us.  We finally did sit, and our waiter proceeded to read -- nearly verbatim -- each item and accompanying description off of the menu.  He forgot, however, to specify the \"Soup of the day\" which we had to flag him down for later.  Waiters should not be seen or heard -- their purpose is to ensure that your experience at the restaurant is about the food and your company.  I don't care what the waiter's initial reaction to the pig tail was.  I decided to order a few small plates, specifically asking for the oysters as the \"appetizer\" portion, while the others ordered standard app/entree.  I received both the oysters and a gazpacho simultaneously, which I could have understood if it weren't for the fact that a mere 10 minutes later--before we had put a dent in the several starter dishes in front of us on the table--our entrees were delivered and the server started asking what (unfinished) apps he could take away.  I've never felt so rushed in and out of a restaurant in my life.  We deliberately took our time on the main course and took a much-needed few minutes break before even picking up the dessert menu (despite several visits by our waiter).  Our wine glasses were removed from the table before our dessert was even finished, and the check was dropped off.  Still trying to make the best of our 65-minute-long dinner, we waited to insert the credit card...the waiter came back and picked up the check without the card which caused further awkwardness.  Ultimately our water glasses were removed before we got up as well.  Horrible.  What I haven't mentioned yet is the wine list.  There is 1 by-the-glass selection per type of wine.  We sampled the chardonnay (which tasted like rubbing alcohol) and the riesling (okay but not great).  We then ordered a $42 bottle of gavi which tasted like moonshine.  Overall, not a quality wine list at all.  What's more bizarre is that there are wine pairings available by-the-glass for each of the desserts -- these individual glasses are NOT noted on the broader wine glass and offer considerable more variety.  One last note on the food itself -- it was awesome.  Everything we ordered was delectable.  However, I could never in good faith recommend that anybody go here for a special night as the service has really ruined something with great potential.", "date": "2011-04-25 17:26:21"}

I am truly baffled about why this place receives such good reviews. Seriously. Since \"Cochon\" is French for pig, I was excited to sample some of their porky goodness!\n\nFirst off, the staff is extremely rude, with an \"I couldn't be bothered\" attitude. Next, the food is simply not delicious or great or even good. It is just fair. Instead of getting a main course, I opted (with high hopes) for the 3 top picks: spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle $10, a side of creamy grits $5, and deviled egg gumbo $6. I also ordered their Swimming Hole cocktail $10 and Pineapple Upside-Down Cake with Coconut-Lime Sherbet (substituted vanilla ice-cream) $7. The best part of my main dining experience was the small pieces of pickled watermelon atop the dry-grilled (emphasis on DRY) ribs. These tasty little cubes were tangy & sweet with just the right texture. The ribs were expectedly not fork-tender (due to the preparation technique on the open grill) BUT, I was expecting them to be teeth-tender! I felt like a barbarian, attempting to render flesh from an unyielding bone! Really! I asked the waitress to exchange the leathery ribs for a more tender batch and she retorted, \"these are not meant to be super tender.\" Got it Lady, but I should still be able to chew them! Anyway, the next batch was definitely a bit less tough but still so so on the tenderness scale. The flavor was decent but not great.\n\nThe grits were perfectly cooked and had a great, creamy texture but they lacked any substantive flavor. What a shame to be so well prepared yet so bland in flavor. [Editorial Note: The BEST grits in this New Orleans are still at Dante's Kitchen...hands down!]\n\nThe deviled egg gumbo sounds weird right off the top, but I figured that such an odd pairing must be fabulous. Not. This dish is a big gamble, which ultimately craps out. Separately, neither the deviled egg nor the gumbo was particularly tasty. In combination, it was a train wreck. \n\nMy cocktail was tasty and helped to pass the time as my mediocre meal was consumed. Surprisingly, the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake was \u00fcber delicious. I would definitely recommend this dessert, should you have a craving for fluffy, buttery and not overly-sweet pineapple cake.\n\nOverall: With so many great places to eat in this town, go elsewhere for polite staff and delicious food. This place missed the mark on so much, and lacks deicious pork fare.", "date": "2011-05-01 14:43:25"}

She gave me a very forced, \"ok, dear\" and removed the check at my request. \n\nWe ate out dessert and and a few minutes later she arrived with 2 coffees which we hadn't actually ordered yet.\n\nIt was my intention to order an espresso, because that is my preference for an after dinner coffee.

To start I waited for 45 min. for a seat at the bar which I didn't really mind but the clueless hostess told me she was going to seat me at the chef's counter and never did, so others got to come in and clam seats before I got one. \n\n        When I finally got a seat I ordered one of the interesting beers they have on tap Tin Roof I think it's called this was pretty good. I started of with a boucherie plate because I wanted to try some of the name sake offerings. Everything on this offering was good but surprisingly the hog head cheese was the best I ever had anywhere, perfect in seasoning and texture. The house rolls are also incredible soft bottoms and buttery crispy tops.\n\n Then keeping to the name sake offerings I then ordered the La cochon de lait. This is a very different take on slow roasted pork. It seems they roast the pork to fork tender then shred, reseason, roll into a ball, then lightly bread and deep fry it. This was interesting but not what I was expecting. The dish also came with cabbage which was good and some non- existent fried turnip cubes and pork rinds. This wasn't a great trip but I would like to go back to try some other dishes and the place has a lot of great reviews.", "date": "2011-05-04 15:51:58"}

However, the experience was really brought down by some of the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant.  \n\nLet me set the stage - we wanted so badly to go here we took at 5:30 reservation on a Thursday, which actually worked out well for our schedule.  The restaurant had only about 5-8 tables full and there were at least as many waiters.  As a former server, I noticed that our server only had one table.  \n\nFirst, the food.  We had the cochon, the bacon and oyster sandwich, a braised pork special, and a fish special.  We also ordered several vegetable sides.  The food was all very good - well seasoned and yummy flavors.  One of our party particularly loved the braised pork.\n\nHowever, the poor service overshadowed our meal.  Our server, despite having an almost empty restaurant, popped by every two minutes for our order even though we were obviously still studying our menus.   Once we ordered, our food came almost immediately which made me a little nervous.  It was good, obviously, but it feels strange to have something plunked down in front of you minutes after  you've ordered it.  I understand the desire to turn tables, but we were well on track to be out of there by 7pm or soon after when the next phalanx was to arrive.    She then continued to be obviously disinterested in us as clients - trying to push drinks and more food on us and acting vaguely annoyed when we didn't order everything she wanted, even though we had appetizers, sides, cocktails and beer.  The cap on the night was when our server had brought our main dishes.  She then disappeared for the length of the meal to the point that we had finished our food, like another reviewer here we weren't really offered dessert, and decided just to get out of Dodge rather than force the dessert issue.    We finally had to flag down another server, to whome we said, \"Could we get our check please?\" and who responded to us, \"Oh, you'd like me to tell your server that you want your check?\"  The attitude was such that all of us looked at each other incredulously and burst into laughter - why one wouldn't just say, \"of course\" instead of trying to teach us a lesson for not asking our server is completely beyond me.\n\nThe crazy thing - the restaurant wasn't even half full when we left.  All that rushing for nothing...", "date": "2011-05-12 04:03:02"}

If you've read my reviews, you know he's a chef and likes pork anything. I found Cochon thanks to the concierge at the W Hotel on a business trip, and have gone every time, sometimes more than once, each time I've been in New Orleans.\n\nSo finally, we're in New Orleans on our honeymoon. I made us a reservation like 2 months in advance, which I'd never done and had always sat at the bar before. This time though, the weather conspired against us and a crazy thunderstorm moved in an hour before dinner. I called a cab, and they weren't sure they could get someone to us in time but they did! On the way over to Cochon lighting streaked across the sky, and the rain continued to fall. We arrived at Cochon but there was nowhere the cab driver could let us off that didn't have 6 inches of water. I took my shoes off and made a run for the door, putting my shoes back ON before entering the restaurant.\n\nWe were seated, by the always friendly host staff, and proceeded to order drinks, then the charcuterie, the mushroom salad with house-made beef jerky (fancy slim jim), pickled shrimp, as well as the fried oyster and bacon sandwich, and the mustard crusted ham hock. Everything was delicious, nothing took too long to arrive. \n\nFor dessert we had the pineapple upside down cake, the butterscotch pudding and coffee. I will say, the wait staff, not the best I've experienced there. I get the impression they want people to eat it and beat it, and our waitress wasn't all that friendly, and didn't refill our water glasses or offer another cup of coffee. She was walking away from our table before I had a chance to even ask. I know it's a decent sized restaurant and always busy but this was really off-putting and not something I'd experienced before when sitting at the bar -- even though I was almost always there alone. I don't know what the problem was, but considering the kind of place it is, the idea that I would ever have to ask for a water refill is pretty inexcusable.\n\nI am so glad I finally got to take my husband here, and the meal was delicious, but I wish I wasn't having to remove a star from my rating because of the service. I hope it's not indicative of management's treatment of the staff, or of the staff being burnt out.

Baked and topped with crispy bread crumbs, the taste of crab meat combined with the somewhat creamy dressing was well balanced. We also tried the fried alligators for the first time. The alligator meat bites were first deep fried until crispy and then tossed in chili garlic aioli. The entire dish had an oriental taste to it especially with the tangy hint coming from the aioli.

After a long 8 month wait to go to this restaurant I finally was able to get back to NOLA this week.  I came here this past Tuesday for lunch and Cochon without a doubt met my expectations.  Cochon is nice open restaurant, and casually designed restaurant with an open kitchen in the back.  I have seen many open kitchens in my day, but not many kitchens that had an wood fired oven.  I've seen custom built pizza ovens but none of them were fueled by wood fire.  A nice touch I thought.\n   After perusing the menu, I had a really tough decision to make on what to order.  I went with two small plates, since I wasn't that hungry.  I hadn't had oysters yet while in NOLA, so I went with the wood fired oysters, and the braised pork cheeks.  This was my first time ever trying cooked oysters, and although they were divine, I definitely prefer my oysters raw.  This is not an insult to Cochon, just a matter of personal preference.  The pork cheeks were out of this world good!  For years I have always heard that the cheek of the animal is the best part, and this was my first time trying cheek, and now I know what everyone is talking about.  These were so good.  Fork tender and served on top of a piece of corn bread, with onions and peas.  If I had the luxury of going to Cochon more often, I think I would always begin with this dish.  My only regret about going to Cochon is that I did not come hungry enough.  I so wanted to try an entree, but I didn't have the room to put it down.  Completely my fault!!!  Next time I head back to NOLA, Cochon is on top of my lists of restaurants to dine at!", "date": "2011-06-11 22:21:04"}

I'm trying to think of a place to start this review LOL  Forgive me if I get off on a rant :P\n\nTo start, make reservations several days in advance.  If you're planning on dining during the weekend, make reservations at least a week in advance.  Maybe even two.  I live in the Cotton Mill so this restaurant is very close to me.  I've eaten here quite often and I'll tell you, ever since this restaurant started showing up garnering rave reviews in New York Magazine, New York Times and various food critic blogs, it's difficult to just walk in and grab a table.  You really need to show up with a reservation already made.  This is one hot spot and it's not unlikely to pass by on the weekend and see a line outside or just inside the door.  Believe me, it's THAT good!\n\nNow, on to the food.  In my experience, the menu reads like that of a tapas restaurant.  This is a terrific place to bring a large group of picky eaters or those who simply want to sample everything under the sun.  Prices range from $5-$11 for smaller plates and $15-$25 for the entr\u00e9e dishes.  If you don't mind my dish suggestions, try the deviled crab with butter crackers, fried alligator with chili-garlic aioli, fried boudin with pickled peppers, spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickles and the andouille gumbo.  I've been eating at this restaurant for about 3 or 4 years now on a regular basis and haven't tried the main entr\u00e9e dishes yet LOL  The small dishes are so great and change on a regular basis so you're always able to try something new.  However, those small plates I listed are always there.  The food is always fresh and comes out expertly prepared.  It's not uncommon to see the head chef, Donald Link, in the kitchen preparing the goodness.  He also owns Herbsaint on St. Charles Ave., for those looking for a more upscale Creole experience.\n\nThe staff are attentive, knowledgeable and the food is ALWAYS great.  I mean that.  I've never had anything of poor quality in Cochon.  The only thing I would say could be improved is the table spacing for parties of two.  To accommodate the swarm of people, smaller parties are usually put at the tables on the right side of the restaurant and often, you're sitting quite close to the adjacent table.  It's not a bad experience for those who are outgoing and don't mind getting to know those around you.  However, if you're not of that kind, you may feel a little uncomfortable.  All is usually forgotten once the food arrives, however.\n\nIn regards to drinks produced from the bar, that menu changes VERY frequently.  The bar staff are always able to create previous menu items, however.  Just ask.  These guys are true mixologists, often taking vintage drink recipes and giving them a modern flare.  They make a killer Old Fashioned.  Don't forget for dessert to request the CatDaddy moonshine!  That's right, folks!  Cochon sells moonshine and man, is it great.  It has a slight hazelnut flavor and burns just the right way going down.  It sure is great stuff!\n\nAll in all, this is a superb restaurant for any occasion, whether it be tourists looking for a unique New Orleans dining experience or natives on a quest for an awesome meal!", "date": "2011-06-14 14:52:45"}

During our visit in New Orleans, we were able to dine at Cochon where Stephen Stryjewski had won the James Beard Award for Best Chef in the South. It was easy to see why he was given this prestigious honor.\n\nI arranged for a group of my clients to join us at Cochon for a late reservation. This worked out really well, because the menu is designed with many small plates. Thus we were able to order several different plates and share in a \"tapas style\" manner.\n\nWe first started off with a round of drinks. The drink for me was decent, but not spectacular. All I remember is that there was watermelon in the drink. It also took a while to receive our drinks, though to the restaurant's credit, it was a packed house. (There were 20,000 librarians in town!) As I could tell that all of the menus were printed frequently, I decided to order by writing on the menu what the table wanted. The waiter said that was unique and the first time anyone had done that.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later and all of our dishes came out simultaneously. Here they are in no particular order. We have here Artichoke &amp; crab stuffed crab. It was very tasty with the accompanying crisps (perhaps pita?) adding a nice textural contrast.\n\nNext is the wood-fired oyster roast. What a great preparation of the oyster, served very warm.\n\nHere was the dish I was dying to try: Fried alligator with chili garlic aioli. Though the alligator is a little chewier (not rubbery, just meatier) it was super delicious. The chili garlic aioli gave it a wonderful tang that I can still taste two weeks later.\n\nOne small plate was simply named hushpuppies. That being said, there was nothing simple about them. They we're phenomenal. The sauce accompanying it was fantastic! One of my clients does not like hushpuppies at all, but fell in love with this version. Everyone also loved the sauce, wanting to have it bottled up. By the way, we loved the hushpuppies so much that we ordered a second round.\n\nCochon is french for pig. Thus a visit to Cochon wouldn't be complete without trying some pork. Thus we ordered the boucherie plate. I don't recall all the various pieces but it did include the following: \n\nHeadcheese - My first experience with it and the texture is off-putting to me personally, though it had good flavor.\n\nPork Rillette - Again, a first for me. A rillette is a paste that is put on bread. The problem was that we didn't get enough bread. On its own, again it had flavor, but it needed the bread.\n\nHouse Made Bread &amp; Butter Pickles - This is my favorite type of pickle and...WOW... just WOW! They nailed the pickles. Perfect amount of tang and bite. Could've eaten a jar of them. \n\nOne of my clients ordered a zucchini salad. Huh?, I thought. A Zuchinni salad? At a restaurant with pig as its name?.... I'm glad they ordered it. It really helped to balance the meal. Most of the other dishes we ate were warm dishes. This salad, which had so much wonderful flavor, was a cool dish and thus added a great balance in temperature. Lesson learned: don't knock a salad at Cochon.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after we submitted our \"menu order\" to our server, he came back and said that the \"spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle\" (another anticipated dish) was gone for the night. In lieu of the ribs, our waiter suggested the Pork Cheeks with lima beans. They were enjoyable and still tasted similar to braised ribs.\n\nThe third dish I was personally anticipating was Rabbit and dumplings. This was another first for me. (Do you notice a pattern emerging?) The rabbit was juicy and succulent. With the accompanying gravy it was very similar to turkey in taste and texture.\n\nOne of my clients, before ordering, asked what the \"Smothered Green Beans\" were smothered in. Our waiter said, bacon, wine, butter... Thus she ordered them. Bacon? YUM! They were a nice side to the meal.\n\nOne of my low-lights of the evening was the chicken and andouille gumbo. For me, it was over salted. Two others really enjoyed it, so maybe I just got a bad batch?\n\nOne of the sad but funny things of the night was Dessert. Our waiter came and said, \"I wanted to let you know that we currently have 20,000 librarians in New Orleans... and... well... they ate all of our dessert.\" He went on to inform us that they noticed that librarians really enjoy dessert and they had planned for an increase in food, but not as much for dessert... He did offer a few options of ice cream, but we were quire content at that point and declined.\n\nChef Stryjewski lived up to the prestige as a James Beard award winner. Next time we're in town, I'd like to try Herbsaint, Donald Link's (Cochon Owner) other restaurant.", "date": "2011-07-07 18:28:09"}

We made a reservation for 8:30 on a Tuesday and as we walked up the street all of the surrounding restaurants were deserted. Cochon was absolutely busting at the seams, always a great sign! The interior sounds terrible on paper, but is really cool looking. It is a mix of wood, plaster, brick, and metal but it is very inviting and interesting to look at. The place is very open and it was fun seeing the kitchen and the plates being expedited. We decided on a few small plates and were absolutely delighted. Here is a run down of our meal:\n\nFried alligator with chili garlic aioli - I seriously couldn't have been more pleased when this hit my palate. The perfect mixture of salt, sweet, and spicy. The alligator was the tinniest bit tough but this was one of those dished that I didn't want to end...ever. \n\nSpicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle - Do yourself a favor and give these ribs a try. I have never tasted ribs like this before and trust me I have eaten plenty of ribs! The sauce was perfect and the watermelon had a wonderful texture and flavor. I know, watermelon doesn't have the most distinct flavor and you would think that it would get lost with the ribs but this is culinary genius on a plate people!\n\nIceberg lettuce with bacon bits, radishes and peppercorn dressing - This salad was disappointing, but frankly we needed some vegetables in our lives after all of the Soul Food. Skip the salad, stick to the meat.\n\nMac and Cheese Casserole - The mac and cheese was definitely delicious, but just a little bit salty. That certainly didn't stop me from eating every tiny morsel, especially the edges around the mini cast iron pan.\n\nFried Peach Pie with salted caramel sauce and sour cream ice cream - I am obsessed with peach pie and I certainly can't find it in Vegas so I capitalized on the chance to try it here. The pie and the ice cream were good, but the caramel sauce overpowered everything else on the plate. I think this dish would have been more successful without the sauce.\n\nOverall, we had an excellent dining experience. The food was surprisingly delicious, I say surprisingly because I hadn't planned to dine here and I usually have a list of restaurants at the ready.  The service was definitely fantastic and I will be talking about the alligator for weeks to come!", "date": "2011-07-28 00:12:38"}

This is a review I have been holding off on because it is my favorite sit down restaurant in the city, so how do you do it justice with the written word?\n\nI have been going here since the week it opened, right around the corner from the latest hotel I was calling home after the storm.  From swapping war stories at the bar with the owner and his wife to coming here for my birthdays, I have never been disappointed with the service, food...or drink.\n\nI'm a sucker for their horseradish potato salad, which accompanies the beef brisket, and their gumbo.  The smoked brisket is so tender that you can leave the knife on the table.  The oven-roasted gulf fish \"fisherman's style\" is a light and delicate choice if you're not all that in to meat (a concept totally foreign to me.)  I have also more recently enjoyed the mustard crusted ham hock and the cochon with turnips, cabbage & cracklins.  You can taste how long everything has been stewing and cooking, because everything is so packed with developed flavors.  And if you like that, don't miss the St. Andrews Day festival every November(Guess who's cooking all that phenomenal Polish food!  http://www.nolabulls.com/saintAndrews.asp?id=0)  \n\nA nice alternative to a salad is the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar.  If you're anti-salad, how can you go wrong with a gooey dish of mac 'n cheese!  I wish they'd make this orange and coffee ice cream I had there once, but the chocolate cake is always a sure ticket to heaven!  They have good cocktails, and they even serve moonshine!\n\nYou really have to admire a place that has the whole hog delivered, and that actually butchers, prepares, and uses it all.  It just has an atmosphere that I'd call fancy casual.  There really is just no place like it.", "date": "2011-08-02 22:58:34"}

We skipped the bar, and were ready to dive into the food. The menu was interesting, and had a good number of interesting choices. But... who was going to listen to us make our interesting choices and take them back to the kitchen? That was a fairly big outage - we were hungry, and our server was ghostly.\n\nOnce we got our order in (two for brisket, two for cochon) we enjoyed the fried alligator and gumbo. It was good gumbo, but not much differentiated from other good gumbo on the trip. The fried alligator tail was every bit as good as folks have said. Yep - order it.\n\nAs for dinner, the food was good. My friends both really enjoyed the brisket, and the volcanically hot mac and cheese side. My friend and I thought the cochon was good, but maybe not as special as we had hoped. The twice-baked potato side was gigantic, and is very shareable (as was the mac and cheese).\n\nOur server was slow on keeping our water full, slow on taking our orders, slow on bringing dessert menus (really??), and slow on our checks. The only time he really perked up was to tell us about the best topless bar outside of town, which was weirdly enthusiastic. Almost uncomfortably so. I would have preferred to hear more of that enthusiasm or passion for the food we were ordering.\n\nSo, if I were to be back in NOLA, I would probably go to Cochon again, but try to go on a slower night. It was certainly good food, and I'd be game to try it with hopes of a little better experience.", "date": "2011-08-04 01:29:50"}

Thankfully, he wasn't our server. \nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, but a little sterile. \n\nThe menu was filled with all types of interesting items, so we ended up ordering several small plates and sides. \nThe wife ordered one of their house cocktails which had several componets,...watermelon, cucumber, and ginger. She said it was very balanced and tasted like summer in a glass. \nI had a local beer, NOLA Hurricane Saison.

The oyster and crawfish pie was amazingly delicious, could have eaten several of those.

Alligator is, I think, more of a textural experience; sauce that accompanied the gator was very good: spicy enough without going overboard.

Probably the only reason for the third star.\n\nOthers had the brisket (oily) and alligator (tough and flavorless).\n\nWith much better restaurant choices in New Orleans, I would not go back.

It ain't cheap, but you can save some dollars and try more dishes by just ordering from the small and medium plates section, rather than the $25-$45 entree items (and our meal was still less than at Emeril's restaurant, and we liked cochon a bit better). The pork cheeks were fantastic, as was the brisket served with horse-radish potato salad. Honestly, everything we ordered was yummy. While we didn't order it, our neighbors got the fish special, and it was gorgeous and oh-so-delicate. We didn't have reservations, but were able to find seating at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and very informative. They'd just added an autumn specialty cocktail (the pumpkin vine) including whiskey, and an infused pumpkin syrup that they made in house. It was divine!! Tasted like Thanksgiving, so smooth and warm, and I just wanted to curl up in front of a fireplace and drink gallons of it. ha!\n\nAlthough it's difficult, save room for dessert. They did NOT disappoint. The pineapple upside down cake was corn-meal based and amazing, served with a super tart lime sherbet (my mouth is watering and puckering just thinking about it). My pal had the apple pie (served with sour cream ice cream, but she's less adventurous, so substituted for regular vanilla). She said it was delicious, too. The surprising part was it was an entire mini pie, rather than a slice, which meant there was more crust/less filling ratio, but that's okay. \n\nDefinitely worth the trip and the cost. And I just love that they butcher their own pigs, and utilize the whole animal. Very cool. The decor is lovely, although a bit overwhelmingly wood-y, with a blond wood (oak) covering EVERYTHING! And strangely, the restroom wasn't heated very much, so that was a bit of a surprise (a bit chilly).  Still, a great evening. Thanks!", "date": "2011-11-09 22:33:52"}

For entrees we had the red fish which was not over-produced for a blackened fish, and the highlight was the Louisiana cochon with cabbage.

The question is, is it enough to live up to an outsider's built up fantasy of the ultimate, authentic New Orleans food orgy for a pretty price. For me, the answer was: damn near.\n\nEven at 2 p.m. or so, there was a healthy crowd feeding. We were able to be seated immediately at a wooden table for two by the gigantic windows that sent the afternoon light shooting into the modern space that seemed more akin to a cafe or fancy college dining center than a place that served what we were about to eat.\n\nMy friend and I went nuts. She sprang for a stiff cocktail named The Swinekiller, while I went for a light state brewed bottle Bayou Teche 31LA as in Louisiana, not Las Angeles) 31 Grenache. \n\nOrdering commenced, and we got cracklins (not on the menu! You just have to ask!) for a few bucks since we hadn't had the opportunity to grab a bag of the hot pork rinds from a gas station on the rural highway. We followed this up with Fried Alligator With Chili Garlic Ailoli ($10), Macaroni and Cheese Casserole ($5), and Smothered Greens ($5).\n\nWhen it came to the main course, we felt pretty tortured by the singular displays of terroir with their simultaneously local and exotic fare. Fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly toast? No, we felt bad for the rabbits. Boudin? We were sure that would be a winner, but we'd tried it already for breakfast at Surrey's (separate review). Oyster & met pie? Shaved hog head?? Catfish courtbouillon??? And what about the namesake Louisiana cochon?\n\nIn the dramatic moments of our final decision, we both swerved for the $25 daily special - a local redfish roasted in the brick and coal oven \"Fisherman's Style.\"\n\nThis was to be the wisest choice of all. Cracklins were cracklins. The alligator was fresh, but beyond salty (even for this salt fiend). Mac & cheese was delicious, but standard, and the smothered collard were a tad limp (even for being smothered), and had a sweet undertone. One curious thing was that someone different brought us each component of the meal. Our waitress brought the alligator, but the sides and entrees appeared at the hands of men in khakis and button down shirts (perhaps Chef/Owner Donald Link and General Manager Tomy Lagneaux!).\n\nThe fish, however, was not only the highlight of the meal but a standout of 2011 and perhaps all the significant fish consumed in my 30 year old life. Only lightly herbed in Cajun spices and devoid of bone but still on the skin, it had an outdoorsy hint of smoke but the sweet inner purity of the water from whence it came. It was also about three pounds of fish meat, and we felt slightly horrendous rolling ourselves down Canal to the ferry.\n\nFor the record, the difference between Creole and Cajun is that \"Creole\" is the French word for \"from here,\" and refers to the melding of cultures that occurred in historic New Orleans between settlers of French descent, British invaders, runaway slaves, and even Native Americans. Cajun is believed to be a Native American adaptation of the word \"Acadian,\" for a bunch of French Nova Scotians who chain migrated to the swamps of Louisiana way back when and subsisted off of the land and its strange creatures.\n\nThis said, Cochon was a great experience in Cajun Southern Cooking. But save for the fish (which did at least half the work and the open fire the other half), we'll never know if Cajun cooking is what we really had, or if it was a dressed up (paid $50 each) replication of what once was in those uncharted bayous.", "date": "2011-11-14 21:30:31"}

So Cochon seated us, despite no reservation, on a recent weekday afternoon. The seats outside looked pleasant...but we ate inside, where it was dark and pleasant. The only negative as to atmosphere was the heavy metal song that blared from speakers toward the end of our lunch. Other than that it was all \"Hotel California\" classic mellow rock. But the food--the gumbo was seafood-less and had SUCH a dark roux--delicious! This is a great place to bring meat-eaters, especially fans of pork. There were probably vegetarian offerings on the menu (aside from dessert) but I didn't really notice them. Even the (unbelievably delicious) pull-apart (Parker House?) rolls were made with lard, as the waitress informed us after I complimented them. The least great thing we had was the crab salad I ordered. It didn't have any stand-out flavors--with beets and satsumas. The crabmeat was stringy (they didn't SAY it was lump, but still...). It needed some dressing (or maybe even lemon?) to raise it up and unify it. My parents each had a bowl of horseradish potato salad with a chunk of beef brisket that was in a broth-y juice. Delicious. I tried a side of smothered greens--very good--and goood mac 'n cheese (really creamy). I'm going to look up his cookbook to see if he gives the mac recipe because I must have it. We each had dessert (mistake because I was getting on a plane after lunch and felt like I needed a second seat). I had the pineapple upside-down cake. Loved the cornmeal texture, but it could have used more of the caramelized pineapple on top. My dad got hummingbird cake, which was tasty. My mom tried the ice cream sandwich that was sweet and salty with chocolate and peanuts.

Cochon was everything I expected and more.  I came with a friend last weekend for lunch, and it was simply incredible.  The flavors that the food emanated was amazing, and it easily became one of my favorite restaurants in NOLA.  If you're looking for good quality food that reflects the flavors of New Orleans, Cochon is it!  \n\nMy friend and I decided to get 2 small plates, a plate from the boucherie section, and an entree and shared everything.  I definitely recommend getting a bunch of small plates and sharing because an entire entree for one person can be a bit filling.  The menu is great for big groups who want to share many different dishes.  If you're like me and want to try as many dishes as possible, then you'll want to order multiple small plates to share.  \nThe two small plates we ordered were Yelp favorites: the wood-fired oyster roast and the fried alligator with garlic chili aioli.  These two dishes were my absolute FAVORITE of everything we had there.  Like everything at Cochon, these dishes were exploding with flavor and awesomeness!  Goodness I want some more thinking about it!\nThe dish we ordered from the boucherie was the fried boudin with pickled peppers!  This just might have been the best boudin I've ever had, so far at least.  I've had boudin from both the restaurants Boucherie and Cochon Butcher (Cochon's sister sandwich shop next door), and I must say the fried boudin from here was more flavorful and yummy. (And the boudin from those two restaurants are pretty darn good too!)  I loved the pickled peppers the fried boudin came with!\nThe entree we tried was the smoked ham hock with red beans and rice salad.  My friend and I was debating on whether to get the much suggested beef brisket or the ham hock, so we decided to ask our server.  She told us that we would be able to find a good brisket in plenty of places in the city, and the ham hock they served was different at Cochon so we decided with the ham hock.  The dish was magnificent and huge!  We could not finish it!  It was good, but I wish it was more flavorful like the previous dishes we ate.  It's great for those who like the smoked taste, but I think I'll try the brisket next time around.\nNow my favorite part: DESSERT OF COURSE!  Cochon offered a number of desserts I wanted to try but of course I couldn't try it all at one time.  I was most interested in the apple pie, hummingbird cake, and the pineapple upside down cake.  My friend is allergic to nuts so we couldn't get the hummingbird cake because it contained pecans.  We decided to try both the pineapple upside down cake and the apple pie.  Both were decadent and delicious, but I did like the apple pie more!  The sour cream ice cream that came with the apple pie complemented it so perfectly!  I know sour cream ice cream sounds weird, but it was awesome!  The other dessert came with a coconut sorbet and it too complemented the cake well.\n\nThe service was also incredible.  The food came out SOOO FAST!  Like really, lightning speed!  Our server was very informative about the menu and catered to us fabulously.  Great experience I must say.  The decor of the restaurant was surprisingly very casual.  For some reason I was expecting it to look much mroe fancy than it actually is.  The restaurant tables and booths are made of wood, which gives it a very casual feel.\n\nCochon was just absolutely FAB!  I can't wait to come back to try the rest of the dishes (and some of the same).  All of their food has sooo much flavor, and that's what I look for in everything I eat, that AMAZING NOLA FLAVAAAAA!", "date": "2012-01-11 02:41:48"}

I was in New Orleans for a trade show, and this was the first night in town.  I was coming off a week in Vegas for a different show, so was looking for a nice, casual, down-home local spot.  Cochon got lots of good Yelp reviews, so I booked an early dinner reservation for a coworker and myself.\n\nWe walked in, and I loved it.  Very cute space.  Very simple, with some big butcher prints hung on the walls and great wooden tables and picnic benches for the seating.  \n\nOur waiter came right over and was super friendly.  Of course, I really think everyone in New Orleans is like 400 times nicer than anywhere else, but he was too.  He told us the specials, took our drink order, and returned promptly with them.\n\nWe shared the grilled shrimp with chow chow $9.  This was yummy and light!  4 grilled shrimp with a pickled watermelon, cauliflower relish.  Delicious!  She got the mushroom salad with deep fried beef jerky and lemon vinaigrette $9.  This was awesome.  Lots of thinly sliced different types of mushrooms marinated in the vinaigrette with fried meyer lemon rinds and lots of slivers of beef jerky bits.  So different and creative, and it really worked well together.  I got a simple arugula salad with shaved fennel and beets in a nice vinaigrette.  Refreshing and light!\n\nShe got the smoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad $19.  This was awesome.  The brisket was so perfectly smoked and fork tender.  The potato salad was super spicy and mustardy and awesomey.  The portion was big, and for $19 it was a steal.  I was torn between like 3 dishes, but the waiter talked me through them all in descriptions and told me i should try the rabbit & dumplings $21.  I went with his recommendation and was so happy!  It was a little rabbit stew in a cast-iron skillet with 4 fluffy dumplings on top.  He said it was like their take on a rabbit pot pie, but with the dumplings instead of a pastry top.  Very good!  Perfect comfort food!  \n\nI wish we had room left for dessert, because I bet they were amazing...but we were so full we couldn't even look at the dessert menu!  This meal was terrific and so \"cheap\", especially after coming off a week in Vegas!  This meal was like half the price of a 2-person meal there.  And it was twice as good as most! \n\nThey also have a really cute butcher shop next door where you can buy merchandise and sausages, little baby pigs, etc.  Very cute.  there's a small bar menu and beer selection too.  This would be a great place for a casual meal. \n\nNext time I'm back in New Orleans, I'll definitely be coming to one or both of these establishments.", "date": "2012-01-19 21:35:36"}

Cochon (even saying the name aloud makes me salivate) is as cool and unique as the city itself. I was in New Orleans for a week and ate my little heart out. Cochon was my favorite restaurant. Yes, definitely not a cheap endeavor but MY GOD IS IT DELICIOUS. I am a HUGE pork enthusiast (I wish I could major in 'Pork Appreciation') and this place did nothing but impress me. Cochon is definitely known for their delectable and diverse pork dishes, but the rest of the non-pork entrees are excellent as well. The appetizers of braised pork cheeks with sauerkraut cake and the oyster and meat pie were so different and simply wonderful tasting. I wish I remembered the name of what I ordered for my main course. It was something Pork-y, French-y, Louisiana-y sounding and it was TO DIE FOR. I have NEVER had something like this. The outside of this pulled pork mound of excellence was crispy and crunchy, whilst the inside was incredibly moist and rich. Perfect. Easily the best pork I've ever experienced. Ok just to nitpick here: our waiter was just fine, not overly friendly or personable, just a mixture of 'meh' and fine. Whatever. So be it. Similarly, we ordered some sort of spiced carrot cake for dessert which was also just 'meh.' Alas, I'm stilling giving Cochon 5 stars because the meats and side dishes here are seriously so special and DAMN TASTY. Perfect. Just like the city.", "date": "2012-01-20 00:13:04"}

My only regret is that I had only one opportunity to eat there during my recent visit to NOLA. I liked everything about this place: the creative menu that brings imagination, superior ingredients and preparation to traditional American fare and more; the attentive and very competent service and the charming, rustic setting which serves to amplify the overall experience.  Cochon transcends Cajun (which I happen to like a lot) with a menu that encompasses Southern regional cuisine and possibly more.  I had the Smoked Beef Brisket with Horseradish Potato Salad.  The balance and combination of flavors was perfect and this dish paired well with the Seghesio Zin that I had with it.  If I had the opportunity to introduce someone from another country to American cuisine and I could take them anywhere in the country and order any dish, this is the dish I would order, because it is a superior implementation of a historic dish with superb ingredients prepared in an imaginative and unforgettable way. The dessert menu is equally amazing.   I arrived relatively late in lunchtime and they had run out of some of the dessert items. I ordered the Moon Pie with Dr. Pepper sherbet.  I recall moon pies from decades past, but Dr. Pepper sherbet was a new one for me!  I probably would have ordered this dessert anyway because it sounded so interesting and it was!

The creole sauce covered the Chicken yet it was so light and distinct that it didn't wash out any of the other flavors.  This was by far the best piece of chicken I have ever had. \n\nThe Macaroni and Cheese: At first glance it appeared to be standard home-style macaroni and cheese, but within the first bite I realized this was not the case. The cheese was definitely not \"kraft american,\" I believe there was a superior cheese blend added to the mix..think \"Gruyere, Asiago, or Parmesan Reggiano\" and it was Fabulous.  (Although not life-changing like the chicken)\n\nOverall this restaurant was the best one that I visited while in New Orleans (yes, better than Emeril's Nola). The decor was modern yet rustic and an added bonus to this restaurant is the street name: Tchoupitoulas (try saying that 10x fast!)", "date": "2012-02-03 17:31:03"}

The fried rabbit liver with pepper jelly was beyond awesome and I nearly ordered another plate of it immediately after the first bite.  The fried boudin balls were good, though I preferred the ones we had at lunch at Boucherie more.  The Louisiana pork was mildly disappointing - I'd had better pulled pork many times before at 1/4 the price and our cracklins were missing the crack and were kind of flabby.  My wife loves mac and cheese and all three of us really loved the pancetta-studded version at Butcher, so we figured it would be a no brainer here.  Nope, as it turns out, not great.\n\nDessert was further down the scale still.  The hummingbird cake was dry and rather unpleasant.  The pineapple upside-down cake was pretty unremarkable and pairing it with a lime sorbet emphasized all the wrong notes of the dulce and the pineapple.\n\nAnd then there was the service, which was uniformly bad.  I called from the hotel to let them know that we'd be a few minutes late.  \"No promises,\" the front of house said.  \"Our reservations are full tonight.\"  So we scooped up my sleeping daughter into the stroller and started running.  As the time for the reservation crept closer and we hadn't yet arrived, my wife told me to run on ahead.  I was glad to see lots of people out walking on Tchoupitoulas or I wouldn't have really dared.\n\nI arrived, on the verge of out of breath, to find a restaurant that wasn't half full.  Now, had I called and said \"we're going to be an hour late,\" I would get making a point of not intending to hold our reservation on a Friday night.  But by the time we finished eating, the restaurant still wasn't even approaching full.  I'd fully explained that I had a sleeping kid that was possibly going to make us late.  Why not cut us some slack?\n\nOur server started out charming and ended up absent.  He walked us through the menu and made a few recommendations, and the food got out to us in short order.  When it came time to get a check, though, he disappeared for 45 minutes.  My poor daughter, 30 minutes short on her nap (my fault) and having put on her party manners at some fairly upscale establishments over the past week, absolutely lost it about ten minutes into that 30 and my wife left to return to the hotel for her.  I watched our server flit around the room, taking drink orders and flirting with the ladies for the rest of the 20 minutes before he returned with the ARE YOU KIDDING DID WE REALLY SPEND THAT MUCH check.  I'm not one to often tip below 20%, but between the reservation static and making me wait so that he could run up people's bar tabs, I was feeling punitive.\n\nThis was our last night in NOLA.  Earlier in the trip, I'd almost bought a shirt at Butcher but figured, since Cochon was around the corner, that I'd return and grab it after we ate.  Sadly, the Cochon experience colored Butcher enough that I left without the shirt.  I'll skip Cochon next time and camp at Butcher instead for half the price and better food.", "date": "2012-02-08 15:00:55"}

Cochon's food is very good and I've enjoyed eating there a few times, but an experience last weekend has prompted me to give this low rating. We were entertaining out of town guests last weekend and went to Cochon for some post-parade dinner.  The alligator appetizer was delicious and we were enjoying our drinks as well. We ordered the ham hock, which came to us covered in organic greens. I noticed that something was moving on the greens. A SMALL GREEN WORM WAS WIGGLING AROUND ON OUR FOOD! Now, I understand that they were busy that night (it is Mardi Gras, afterall) and no doubt the chefs were really churning it out., but this was so unappetizing and repellent that I pretty much lost my appetite. To top it off, we sat there for a full 10 minutes watching the thing squirm around our food before we were able to flag down a server. They were busy but when a waitress notices four people sitting at a table with a look of utter disgust on their faces, she needs to swing by and see what is up. We finally flagged down a waiter and he he swooped this off our table with a brief excuse about \"You know, those organic greens\". I realize this is a valid statement but c'mon, if I am served a bug on my food I need more of an apology from the waiter than a shrug. They brought out a new ham dish for us, which was good, but it was hard to eat after seeing such a disgusting image. I expected after that, that they would have comped the dish, sent out a free round of drinks or dessert or something to make amends, but when the bill arrived, they had charged us for the dish that had a worm., along with everything else. When a restaurant makes a mistake like this they NEED to make amends. Cochon is not cheap and it is not a little hole-in-the-wall taqueria. This is a finer dining establishment and in this case, I was not satisfied with their apology for serving me a writhing invertebrate.    \n\nI have one other criticism: Last year, my business partner and I hosted a work dinner for about 12. When making the reservation, I told the hostess that this was an important work dinner and it would be nice if we had a good table for our party. They sat us right near the front door in Feb, which blasted freezing air every few minutes. We dropped about $800 at that dinner while our colleagues shivered through the whole meal. For a big important party like that, it would have been nice if they'd done more to accommodate us.", "date": "2012-02-20 21:31:13"}

As for the aioli, I need the recipe in order to go on living.\n\nBefore the complaints, I would like to also say that the feel and decor of the restaurant were truly outstanding...humble and rustic yet modern.  I'm not so good describing decor, but all I know is that it felt like a great place to be.  Ok, to the not so good parts: service wasn't great, despite the restaurant being nowhere near capacity.  Also, I ordered the cochon, the dish that is the restaurant's namesake, as my entree and was less than impressed.  Though the pork was obviously juicy (read: covered in juices), it still felt dry to me and just fell flat somehow.  I was also not impressed with the accompaniments, even though it had cracklin.  Lastly, the house beer we ordered was nothing to write home about.\n\nDespite all these things though, the way I felt while dining at Cochon and those damned lovable alligator poppers still garner this restaurant the highest of marks.

It's basically twice-cooked pulled pork. The brisket was prepared in a somewhat unconventional way that left it with a lighter color, yet it was still delicious with its sauce and very tender. Finally, the ham hock was amazing. The smoked flavor goes perfectly with the hock of the pig, and the meat flaked away from the bone in a way that can be described as gorgeous. \n\n\"There's a pie under this ice cream!\" I exclaimed in joy as we began dessert. It was a chocolate salty caramel contraption, and that should sell anyone on trying it. Wonderful. Also, the servings of dessert port wine are very generous!\n\nWe also had reasonably good cocktails with dinner, but I doubt they are an integral part of the experience. Try this place out to sample some delicious and well-prepared meats.", "date": "2012-03-07 22:47:32"}

My brother, a New Orleans resident, called 3 days in advance to make a reservation and was told the only openings were 5pm or 10pm.  We made a reservation at 5pm and asked them to call if there was a later opening.  The day of the reservation, they called to confirm and we once again asked to get in a little bit later.  We were told they were booked and they would call if anything opened up.  We arrived at 5pm and were the 3rd or 4th table seated.  It didn't even start getting even a little busier until 6pm and when we left at 6:40, there were still tables that had not been sat in the entire time we were there.  Why they could not fit us in even 30 minutes later remains a mystery, but their inconsideration got the meal started off on the wrong foot.\n\nOur waitress was not super friendly.  We asked to substitute the vegetables from one dish with those in another dish and were flat out told that \"chef\" was unable to accommodate that.  Then we asked for some details about an appetizer and were told that there were 3-4 pieces of meat (pork cheek).  We requested that they include 4 (4 of the smallest pieces would have been just fine) since there were 4 of us and we were once again told \"oh no, I cannot ask chef to do that.\"  I am not sure what kind of person this \"chef\" is, but he definitely isn't an accommodating one and the waitress seemed slightly frightened of him.  When the dish arrived it had 3 pieces-you would think at the very least the waitress would have cut one of the larger pieces herself to try and make her guests happy.  We had to flag down the waitress to ask for more bread (after she just whisked the empty basket away) and they never came around to fill our water (we had to ask).  We also had to wait 10 additional minutes for one person's entr\u00e9e while the rest of our food sat in front of us on the table and got cold without so much as an apology.  Lastly, we got a new waitress for about 25 minutes in the middle of the meal and then our original waitress returned and basically threw the check on the table at the end.  All in all, a very odd and disappointing meal.\n\nThat being said, the food was quite good, but for the price I expect to be treated much better.  We will not be returning here on our next visit.", "date": "2012-03-12 17:27:26"}

Sort of like making out with your cousin in law at a family party.\n\nBut the highlight of the appetizers had to be the fried alligator with garlic chili aioli. This was amazing. I had never had alligator before. I now know what I have been missing my whole life. Sort of like the first time I had sex without a condom.\n\nBefore my meal, I also had a bowl of their pork and \"black eyed pea\" gumbo. It was \"Fergalicious.\" Wow. That was a terrible joke. Just shoot me with an elephant tranquilizer right now.\n\nFor my main course, I had an amazing dish called Lousiana Cochon. It was like carnitas on crack that is also on a steroid cycle. All my coworkers ordered different meat entrees. But in the end, nobody beats my meat.\n\nFor dessert, we all shared a Chocolate Caramel Peanut Brittle Ice Cream Bar. Big name. Big flavor. Big belly.\n\nMediocre writing and horrible jokes aside, if you are in New Orleans, please visit this place.

It was nothing short of phenomenal. The oyster roast, for one, was absolutely delicious. I am a big fan of oysters and constantly on the lookout for oyster bars and such and I must say Cochon did a great job: the sauce complimented the fresh, succulent seafood and every single oyster was of a decent size! (Really hate it when you get a teeny quarter size dollop of a meat :P)\n\nComing from Florida, I am not unfamiliar with gator dishes. I have had some pretty blah/icky ones where the meat just tastes like..chewy-er chicken seasoned with a hint of dirt. Thankfully it wasn't the case with Cochon! They did a really good job breading the gator meat and wow! the chili garlic aoli sauce! I love the perfect amount they tossed the fried gator in. I enjoyed it :)\n\nHowever! I had my FIRST boudin here and I must say it was really spectacular. It reminded me of Chinese meatballs but instead of in a stew it's fried/seared. Super yummy.\n\nOf course, we got the mirliton, celery & grapefruit salad because all that meat needed to be balanced out. It was light and fresh and everything I wanted it to be. Oh, mirliton is basically a squash-like vegetable.\n\nNeedless to say, it's not a meal unless there's dessert involved! :D Pineapple Upside-Down Cake was the one we decided to get and ohhh my God...\n\nAmazing.\nSo good.\nEspecially that coconut-lime sorbet.

Also, she never finished an entire plate of food the entire time during the NOLA visit, yet she was picking at the bones trying to find more meat.

The alligator was very salty, even for two people who love salt, and we kind of wished that the chili garlic aeoli had been on the side, rather than top of the alligator, so the salty factor could have been adjusted per our own liking.\nAs an entree, we split the special; a crunchy pork belly on top of greens, black eyed peas, and an onion bernaisse ($27). The pork belly was good, but there was very little pork (I know pork belly is fatty, but SOME meat would have been nice to go with the crunchy skin). It was just alright. The greens were really the star of the plate.\nFor dessert, we got the pineapple upside down cake with a lime ie cream and dolce de leche drizzle ($8). This was delicious, and not too heavy. It ended the meal on a positive note.\nAll together, the meal was $83.31, before tax. The oysters and dessert were very good, but everything else was mediocre, especially considering the price. It was definitely ot worth close to a bill after the tip.\nAs for the service-it was also mediocre.

I fell in love with eating gator meat after this day, although it still makes me sad as I think they're cute. The fried alligator bits are covered in a chili aoli sauce, along with some sauteed onions and I believe mint. Great combination. It felt like I was popping calamari in my mouth. I would've ordered this as an entree if I could have. We also ordered an oyster appetizer that was good as well.\n\nThey also have good sides. I of course had to order the macaroni and cheese. Not the best I've had, but still pretty darn good. For $5, you get a good amount. The grits here are what had me change my opinion of grits as well. So friggin good! \n\nAs for entrees, I went with the rabbit and dumplings, and my friend and I shared this along with the smoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad. 2 ordered the chicken, and one ordered the cochon. The chicken and brisket were incredibly dry. Such a bummer. My friend with the cochon said it was just okay, and the rabbit and dumplings were in a stew that I did not care for. Such a waste of entrees as we clearly enjoyed everything else.\n\nI forgot our server's name, but she was fabulous!

The overall vibe is convivial and welcoming, and the open kitchen certainly adds to that lively atmosphere.\n\nFor drinks, I tried Tin Roof Brewery Voodoo Bengal ($5), which is a nice American Ale with a rich, hoppy taste, and a slightly sweet, caramel-like aftertaste.

It is down near the warehouse district (I think), so is away from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon St. There are some other cool little restaurants and bars nearby as well. When the weather is cooperating they have outdoor seating, which made it possible for us to enjoy after dinner cigars, a moonshine tasting and coffee. \n\nThe meal was a reflection of your typical NOLA cuisine, only amped up!\nWe started out with some wood fired oysters, fried boudin with pickled peppers, and braised pork cheeks with sauerkraut potato cakes, applesauce and goat feta. All of these were great. Our unanimous table favorite starter was the pork cheeks. They were so tender they melted in your mouth. \n\nOur entrees included two nightly specials, one of them being the fried soft shell crab served over a salad of summer squash, black eyed peas and tomatoes. This was one of my favorite dishes, I thought it was fresh and spring-like. However for the other 3 men at the table it was not their favorite. The other special was my entree, the roasted pork loin, skin on, with creamy grits and greens. When the waiter explained it, I thought the skin would be more crisp than it was. It ended up being kinda chewy and unappetizing. This is actually is the reason that I'm only giving 4 instead of 5 stars. I will say that this was only a special, and not on the regular menu. My husband had the rabbit and dumplings. It was served in an individual sized cast iron skillet. The dumplings were not too heavy, and the gravy was magnificent. It also was a good opportunity to get to eat some rabbit, not something you find everyday on menus. The last entree we had was the Louisiana Cochon. Basically what this restaurant was named for. It was a tender piece of pork shoulder topped with crispy cracklings. Not to be missed!\n\nWe did get a couple of side dishes as well. By far the star of the side dishes in my opinion was the broccoli and rice casserole. This is not your mama's casserole. So delicious. I actually could have eaten that as a meal. The grits are also amazing. They are full of butter and just creamy goodness. Like true grits should be. Our least favorite side dish was the eggplant and shrimp dressing. It was pretty tasty with good shrimp flavor, but the other side dishes on the table just out shined it. \n\nFor dessert we split some lemon cream pie. We were stuffed to the brim. They also have a great cocktail menu. I had a Trotter Jennings, which is Vodka, St. Germain, Prosecco and lemon juice. Their coffee is nice and strong too. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and able to answer all of our questions. He was also able to make some recommendations, something I always appreciate. For the 4 of us, each having 1-2 cocktails, 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, 1 dessert, 2 coffees and a moonshine tasting the price was only around $294, plus tip.", "date": "2012-04-08 22:09:46"}

We had a reservation early which I had made in advance before we traveled and was told by the staff \"we got lucky\", but when we got there, nobody was in the place. Seemed strange. The place was modern and had a nice vibe. I will warn that if you are going here to get suckling pig or pig sliced off the bone, its not on the menu. Yes, there are pork dishes, but I went there thinking we would get some roast suckling pig cuts, or cracklings but what was on the menu was essentially pulled pork (which I could do at home) and some apps (homemade cold cuts and head cheese). I saw some other reviews that had dishes that had much more pig, but I guess not on the night that we went. We ordered wine off the list, but they were out of the two that we ordered which to me is kinda lame. We decided to get the starters and sample as much as we could and since nothing on the main menu really caught our eye. Unfortunately all the dishes came out at once even though we asked it to be one at a time, so it was hard to even find room at the table. The roasted oysters were really good and came baked with a nice spicy sauce. The cold cut sample was good too. The head cheese was speckled with lot of nice head meat and had a good flavor. The homemade mortadella was good and so were the salamis. I think the best thing was the boudin balls. Nicely fried and had nice spice. The pork cheeks were on the dry side and didn't have a ton of flavor. \n\nOverall, its a nice place and the food was good but not overwhelming by any means. This place gets a lot of press and has been on a couple of TV shows, but I wasn't impressed and if in NOLA again, I would skip for sure. The service was just OK. The wine mishap was lazy on their part.  While I normally dint care that several servers are waiting on us, the \"main\" waiter essentially sat us and brought us the bill. I would have rather given the tip to the server who served us the most and had to tell us about the wine. Its too bad she had to split money with him.

I've had alligator before and this app came through, tender and not overcooked with hint of aioli and fresh mint sprinkled on top.  Braised pork cheeks, first time trying it, was tasty and fall-off-the-fork-scrumptious.  Now the signature cochon...was very good as well -I would describe the texture as pulled pork moulded into a \"cochon patty\".  My partner in crime even used the shredded cochon and made a mini pulled cochon slider with the baked rolls, genius! haha\n\nIf you're looking for a nice evening with some good food and a glass of wine, definitely consider trying this place.

Long, languid intervals between every visit to our table ensued, and her facial expression never improved. \n\nBut if I put aside the \"you're totally a pain in my ass\" attitude from the server, I can gush about the food at Cochon. I had a chicken thigh that was melt in your mouth tender, and creamy, delectable macaroni and cheese. My cohorts had the Louisiana Cochon - a juicy, tender pile of pulled pork - the lima beans - fantastically prepared in a baked beans style and out of this world tasty - the fried boudin balls - crisp, delicious and not a crumb left uneaten. \n\nThe menu seems a bit sparse - and it's the same menu for lunch and dinner. The salad choices aren't really salads, per se, and I'm not sure that there's a healthy veggie in the bunch, so it's not a choice for the diet conscious.

The rolls are unbelievable, you will want to fill up on them, they're warm and delicious with the salted butter, just perfect. We followed all the recommendations and got the baked oysters, the alligator, the ribs with watermelon pickle.  Not one of these three dishes compared with the pure velvety Southern perfect divinity of the smothered greens, the eggplant dressing and the lima beans, three dishes that don't seem to be recommended here much. The oysters were lovely, no doubt - smoky and cooked to perfection. The ribs were just average, dry and a bit stringy and the watermelon pickle was super sweet and didn't really go with the meat, kind of like that sauce Chinese restaurants give you in the takeout bag for your ribs. \n\nHonestly, the alligator was kind of gross, four people agreed. The coating is weird, halfway between panko-delicate and Kentucky fried. Not crispy and kind of limp, with a vaguely gummy texture and a flavor we couldn't place, but not in a good, exotic, \"wow, I've never eaten anything quite like this before\" way but in a \"this could be chicken, this could be some kind of tofu\" bewilderment way.\n\nOur drinks were very good, we had Tiger Tails (made with tequila) and very good wine.

I ended up ordering the beef brisket and overall, I thought it was just okay. At times it was too salty, but at least the meat was tender. The horseradish potato salad was good but I could not finish it because it was too heavy. My dad enjoyed his beef cheeks and cold meat dish, and my mom ordered the chicken and thought it was rather bland.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the pecan tart with burbon ice cream and the pineapple upside down cake. The tart was delicious and the ice cream added a nice bitter touch. The pineapple cake wasn't as memorable.\n\nService: We started dinner at 6pm before the crowd got in, and service at the start was rather nice and attentive.

From the top of my head that was the gator, the ribs, the chicken, the loaded potato and the cucumber salad.  Next to my excitement of trying a strange new food such as gator, I really enjoyed the cucumber salad.  I would not let my fiance have the last bite, and I usually tend to be quite giving.

I think this place deserves 3.5 (maybe 4). Decor and ambiance are great, especially knowing you are in a warehouse district. Staff is average although very friendly.\n\nNow let's talk food. The menu is a bit shorter than expected and I got lost from the vibe: is it a \"cochon focused place\" (aka pork), is it a bbq/roasted specialist, is it a true cajun/creole restaurant, is it a charcuterie (aka cold cut) spot..... well I am not sure at the end which I think will lose the epicurian and other foodies like me. Nevertheless, the food was fairly good.\n\nI definitely recommend to try their oysters broiled platter which are about 6 oysters put in the oven with a succulent tomotoe'ish sauce; one of their top item. Not really excited by the rest of the menu, I tried the pork cheek with a side of mac n cheese. Both good but nothing out of a good restaurant.\n\nI think overall you won't be very disappointed by going there. Place is pricey for the portion and fairly casual environment. Cochon Butcher is the sandwich sister place next door, I suggest to go have lunch there instead. You will save money while still enjoying a great pig experience. I think I will give Cochon on my next trip and see if they have refined their vision and menu.", "date": "2012-05-30 01:55:39"}

However, that was short lived to say the least as soon as I step foot into the place. We had an 8:30PM reservation, but were not seated until a little after 9:00PM. During which, we sat at the bar and were quite honestly ignored by the bartenders. I order for us to order a drink, we had to \"flag\" down the bartender on multiple occasions. Keep in the mind, the bar counter probably has only 10-12 seats, of which we occupied 3 seats. Once we were seated, we soon found out that we had two different waiters on the evening. The said part was they were both extremely arrogant and moody. To start with, we asked for bread....it never came. When the waiter came back, we asked again, to which he replied \"oh, it's in the oven and will be out shortly\". Additionally, we asked for one of the waiters to take a picture of the four of us...he said he would come right back to do it once he placed our orders. He never did, and when he did, we had to remind him again...it was like pulling teeth. However, probably the biggest issue we had with the place was when we were putting in our orders. They were out of their top two items!!!  I could not believe it! And when I inquired as to why, the waiter rudely said \"you know we are one of the top restaurants in the country\". We were eating on a MONDAY night, it was not a Friday or Saturday when restaurants typically get large crowds!!! Given we had two different waiters, not one time did either of them stop by our table throughout the meal portion to ask how everything was! Even waiters at Olive Gardens do this!!!! \n\nOverall, the service was terrible, even the wait staff was rude when were leaving. We told them that we had a bad experience, and they too arrogantly said, \"OK, thanks for letting us know\". Although the food typically keeps people coming back to restaurants, I would NEVER go to this place again based solely on the arrogant and rude service we received over the course of the night.", "date": "2012-06-01 17:05:14"}

We arrived at 5:30 and found the restaurant to be somewhat empty, with only a handful of tables occupied.  Our servers, Garland & Rachel, (yes, each table apparently gets 2servers) came individually with the regular greetings.  Garland was very helpful with drink and food suggestions; Rachel, well, not so helpful, rather a bit snobby.  I'm actually glad we had 2 servers, cause that would have sucked if we were stuck with Rachel.  Anywho, on with the more important stuff...FOOD!!\n\nCocktails:  Catahoula Hound Dog.  One of the best cocktails I've had!  Very refreshing and alcohol was not so strong.\n\nAppetizers:  We ordered the wood-fired oyster roast and the fried boudin balls.  Wow.  Oysters were perfectly cooked and the seasoning/spice was not overwhelming.  It was good to the last bite.  The fried boudin balls were amazing!  I love boudin, and i love fried food, so the combination was heaven. ( is it sad that my mouth is watering while i'm typing this????)\n\nEntrees:  I had the brisket with horseradish potato salad, and the BF had the Louisiana Cochon-dish.  My brisket was fork tender and perfectly seasoned.  The potato salad was a wonderful accompaniment to the brisket because of the little horseradish \"kick\" that just gave that little zing to each bite.  I gave the BF a little bite of my entree...I could tell he wanted to switch.  Yea... goes without saying, the dish was scraped clean.  On to his La. Cochon dish.  All I can say is that it was just too salty for both our tastes.  I can see him taking a sip of water every time he finished a bite.  He ate about a third of the dish and decided it would just be better to take it home and slap two pieces of bread around it and make it a \"pulled pork sandwich.\"( He really ended up doing that, and it came out actually good... sad, eh??)\n\nAs for dessert... I asked Rachel what was one of their more popular desserts here at the restaurant.  Her response, \"I'll get you a menu, \" which she later dropped off, told us what the ice cream & sorbet of the day were,  and went away.  The BF and I looked over the menu, and didn't see anything enticing.  So, we opted to skip dessert...which i rarely ever do!  Desserts always complete  a meal for me, so it was a bit disappointing that Rachel could not even suggest something for us.  Of course, anyone can read the damn dessert menu, but the menu does not tell us what is more popular, or perhaps, which dessert the place may be known for.  \n\nTips:  \nAll in all,THUMBS UP for catahoula hound dog cocktail, wood fired oysters, fried boudin, brisket with horseradish potato salad, Garland!!\n\nTHUMBS DOWN for the salty Louisiana cochon and Rachel.", "date": "2012-06-13 04:57:45"}

The Macaroni & Cheese Casserole was not too big but it complemented perfectly with my entr\u00e9e. It tasted good especially in the few areas where it was baked to have a crispy texture.

One of the oysters on the plate was gigantic and it was so well seasoned and creamy, I didn't feel the slightest bit weird about it. I thought these were great. We also had the fried alligator which was tossed in a chili sauce. The sauce reminded me a little bit of wing sauce (this isn't a bad thing!) and the meat was super tender. After that we ordered the pork cheeks with corn grits and tomato salad. I wasn't sure what to expect with this one--I have never even seen a pork cheek. These were also really good, tender morsels of meat. This dish was one of my boyfriend's favorite things we ate on our trip to New Orleans and we ate a LOT. For our entree we had the rabbit and dumplings. This was good, but kind of underwhelming compared to the appetizers.

This was my first time to New Orleans. While down there, I had the opportunity to visit some very well-known eateries. One of them was Cochon. A high priced, over-hyped fry kitchen. \n\nFirst, let me say that I expect a specific kind of elegance and complexity in my food when I visit a high class restaurant. If I want to eat a shrimp po-boy or a bucket of fried stuff I will go to a fry kitchen where I can eat all the lard I want for pennies on the dollar. Why would I do this instead of eat at a high class fry kitchen? Well it's simple. If something is coated in oil and fried, it pretty much tastes the same as anything else. You taste grease and burnt *whatever was fried*. It's not a sophisticated flavor. Certainly not one that warrants a $15 price tag for something no bigger than two quarters placed next to each other. I'm not going to say I'm a sophisticated diner. I don't have an amazing palette, I can't tell the difference between an oyster fried in ultra refined and purified butter mixed with the glandular oils from a peacock and an oyster fried in pan drippings from a chicken leg; and that's really my point. If you can't tell the difference why pay for the difference? That was really the theme of my meal. Why am I paying for this? I honestly can't tell the difference.... Maybe I'm a dimwit for not understanding, but I just didn't see the point. I ordered several items from the menu, 4 appetizers an entree and a dessert. The appetizers were pork ribs (mediocre), pork cheek (indiscernible from a tender roast), oysters (blah), and a stuffing type dish that I have forgotten. The entree was a roast with a horseradish mash of some kind (all extremely salty -- I think NOLA residents really like salt). For dessert I ordered a peach turnover -- it was disgusting. \nFood: 2/5\n\nCochon is a very nicely designed restaurant. It has a very upscale vibe to it. The settings however are reminiscent to a commercialized restaurant, though I think the dim lighting causes many visitors to overlook this fact. I personally did not. I think that really is the illusion here. The hype and name results in patrons believing their food is better than it actually is. I know for a fact that I have had meals that were better than this. The difference is that when I or someone else pays a 3 digit bill for themselves, you begin to think that the restaurant must have amazing tasting food, and your brain actually causes this to be reality. I like to call it food placebo. Certainly the food isn't bad, but should I be paying top dollar for it?  Then what am I paying for, the atmosphere? Nope. I didn't see a band playing the evening I went. I didn't see anything in fact. Just a packed restaurant with people clamoring to get into the \"scene.\" If one person says it's good, nobody will argue. Nobody wants to be seen as the person who \"has no sense of taste,\" but Cochon is not tasteful. It's a hype train gone wild.\nAtmosphere: 3/5\n\nThis place is so ridiculously expensive, it's stupid. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem dropping mad dough for an experience. I spend like a leaky faucet in a flood; however, I don't see the point in paying more than something is worth. The majority of Cochon's dishes are worth (in flavor) $5.50; however, it charges a 200% premium minimum on its dishes and serves such meager portions that you'll be wondering where the server dropped the remainder of your food and when he'll be admitting this to you. Cochon is a place you go to take the in-laws when they're visiting, your girlfriend when she's mad at you, or your parents when they come for your graduation. It is not a place you go to eat and feel satisfied.\nValue: 1/5\n\nThe service at Cochon was adequate. The waiter came to our table 3 times over the course of 1.5 hours. Enough? Not quite. Was it busy? Certainly, but when I pay over $100 for my meal and give a $30 tip, I expect better service. \nService: 3/5\n\nCochon is such a waste of time. It really made me angry to find that a place so beloved by so many celebrity chefs was so awful. I just didn't understand it. I will NEVER go back to Cochon, EVER. I was appalled.

Last year's winner for best chef in the South by the James Beard Foundation, so it was a no-brainer.  Just before I left for New Orleans I also watched the movie \"Jeff Who Lives at Home,\" and part of the story took place at Cochon so that was another, albeit slight, contributing factor to my patronage here.\n\nI really wanted some alligator on this trip so the fried alligator with garlic chili aioli was ordered for the appetizer.  It was quite good, a little bit of heat, and nice tender morsels of battered and fried alligator.  For my entree I ordered the oyster and bacon sandwich, based on a recommendation by someone I know very close to the chef, which was pretty phenomenal.  The best fried oysters and nice crispy and savory bacon all between two plain buttered slices of toasted white bread.  Mac and cheese on the menu as a side dish so I had to order it.  Very creamy and rich and really good.  The chocolate cake I had for dessert here was probably the best and most decadent chocolate cake I've ever had in my life and it was a massive portion to boot.  Instead of frosting on the top and outer edge of the slice was a nice thick layer of fudge.  The cake was very rich and moist but to cut into the richness of the cake and fudge, in between the layers of cake, was like a light sour cream mixture that looked like caramel which sounds odd but went so well with the cake which was also topped off with some crumbled nuts.  It was a dessert from the heavens. \n\nIn terms of spirits, they provide you with a standard bar and cocktail menu but ask for moonshine and you'll get a different drink menu.  Ordered a flight of the flavor-infused moonshine which I really liked.

By the time we realized it was next door we had already sat down and was browsing the menu. \n\nIt wasn't a bad idea at all to try out this place. The alligator appetizer was amazing! The boudin was okay to me, but the side dish of twiced baked stuffed potato was heaven! I've never had such a delicious side dish of potato. We ordered a bunch of small dishes and a single entree of rabbit and dumpling. My friends loved the entree, but I'm not a person who loves soup like dishes. But for what it was it was pretty decent to me. \n\nI think we were happy campers with doing the family style dining. We were stuffed as can be! Our total was around 69 and a heads up that they do up to 4 separate payments but absolutely no split checks. I believe that's what it said in the menu when you order or it was on the receipt. \n\nIt'll be a while before I go back there again seeing as the cost is a bit much.

That's all you need to know. Of course, there was not one bad thing we ate that entire meal, but those three were the ones that really stuck. \n\nThe oysters are truly like nothing I've ever tasted before. How they wind up with that fiery, smoky kick infused into the juicy oysters, I have no idea, but it's genius. You need absolutely nothing to dress these up with. The rabbit and dumplings made me a rabbit believer- tender, somewhat wild-tasting meat was a great sub for the chicken version. Oh, and the alligator was my first experience eating it and I could eat theirs on the regular. Fried up in a tangy, almost buffalo-style sauce (I understand that's culinary blasphemy, but I can't think of a better way to describe it), they are lightly fried enough that you know you're eating some real meat and they're not just trying to cover it up. Don't miss that dish! Service is outstanding. I could have kicked it with our server Calvin all night, and he was wonderfully discreet in replacing my embarrassingly dirty napkin after my bout with the fall-off-the-bone ribs. \n\nI love that Cochon is doing inventive things with their food while still being really straightforward and not too gastronomically crazy.

Decadent and worthwhile of an entree version, since I could have lost myself in it. \n\nFried alligator with a chili aioli? 3 stars, just because alligator tends to taste like whatever you might coat it in.

I wasn't sure how I would like it, but it was refreshing and quirky.\n\nLouisiana Cochon? What can go wrong with pulled pork that is formed into a patty and crisped, served over a bed of turnips and cabbage and topped with peaches? Not a single thing. I don't even like turnips - or at least I didn't until today. I wish there had been more peaches or larger pieces of peaches, but that would just be nitpicking.\n\nDessert? The banana pudding was glorious and my dining companion said he is going back tonight just to have it again before leaving town. The apple crumb cake with cheddar cheese ice cream was the only disappointment. The cake was wonderful, but I just couldn't get past the sharpness of the ice cream.

I could easily down about 6 or 7 of these bad boys.\n\nAs most people have stated below, the deep fried gator is a star. It's young and tender, and the crust is crispy and not too greasy.

But after awhile, I just felt that the mint in the dish  was just too strong.\n\nThe Wood-fired Oysters was good.  A little bit spicy (which I liked), but it was a little bit on the small size (the oyster).", "date": "2012-10-27 03:58:31"}

The food was amazing, however, if I went again I would skip the cold meat plate and order another hot entree, and I would skip the macaroni and cheese and go for a different side. Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing, but after having the pork cheeks, everything else simple just tasted so underwhelming and it left us wondering what the other hot entrees would have tasted like. Halfway through the meal, the waitress brought us a basket of cracklin from the kitchen, which is pig fat fried so it's crispy like a chip. She gave us sugar cane syrup to dip it in, and it was delicious! The waitress was also spot on in terms of telling us how yummy the pork cheeks were, and how good the cracklin was (we had to have some convincing to try it).

I would suggest trying another dish than this, as it was not utterly memorable like every other aspect of the meal.\n\nFor dessert - we shared a banana pudding, which was simply the best example of the dish I have ever eaten in my life.

The citrus in the vinaigrette went perfectly with the mushroom and the beef jerky was a very nice touch.\n\nFor my main dish I got the cochon de lait, which was served with cracklins. The cracklins were fun but in retrospect they were nothing compared to the fresh cracklins I tried in Lafayette... But the cochon de lait was very good. I don't really care for cabbage (I know, odd for a Korean girl), but the cabbage in this dish was excellent. If my memory serves me right, I think my professor had the ham hock, and he definitely enjoyed it.\n\nI had a great time overall.

Flavor.Clever.            Repeat.\n\n\nThe visit came after a brief walk from the edge of the French Quarter - through the warehouse district that is destined to become \"the next big thing\" and led by places like Cochon.  This is a professional restaurant, well-crafted from the cocktail creations to the small plates and right through to the heart of things.  Chicken hearts, stuffed pigs feet, alligator all show up on the menu in ways that are beckoning you to color outside your food comfort zone.  It's OK because remember - this is a professional restaurant.\n\nA last-meal-on-this-visit would not be complete with out oysters and the wood roasted variety on the Cochon menu did not disappoint.  Follow them up with and order of pork cheeks and you're on your way to flavortown.  A decadent sweet potato mash with hog jowls topped with candied nuts was channeling the whole concept of autumn in one dish.\n\nBut the namesake was incredible - Lousiana cochon - cooked down, shredded and griddled in a cake form.   Cabbage and a uber-crispy crackling worked its umami magic atop this wonderful entr\u00e9e.\n\nCocktails?  Plenty of creativity to select from but the St John's Bayou (Catdaddy Moonshine, local NO dark rum, fig bitters and OJ) rocked my world. Handle this one with care!  There's even Frenet Branca for those who've over-porked themselves and need a digestif.\n\nTable tending team of Mike and Mike was great -asking the order we'd like to have the dishes presented, keeping a watchful eye on the table and enjoying our questioning of local ingredients and preparation techniques.  Professional service.\n\nI think that when a restaurant puts forth a menu that challenges you to choose among so much of what you'd like to try, it deserves accolades.  Professional restaurants do this from start to finish and Cochon was no exception.

About Cochon I wanna say something including, \"All the best from land, swamp and sea.\" And that's probably just cause I wanna mention swamp... and that's just cause I feel need to mention the alligator, just like everyone else. \n\nReally though, that super light and crispy, almost tempura-like, batter-fried alligator with a bright orange, chile-garlic aioli is easily the best alligator I've had. Not to front like I'm a constant alligator-eatin' thing of a person, but I've eaten preparations here and there in my time, and Cochon's unique version is by far is my favorite. It's a completely delicious appetizer. \n\nI also love the wood fired oysters as a starter; perfectly cooked and well-seasoned, juicy juicy. We've enjoyed those before but with a name like Cochon, the pig has to be good. Or it should be as it'd be a cryin shame otherwise. It is great, so have no fear. They know what they're doin.  They cure and smoke their own meats and sausages.The boucherie section of the menu is fantastic. \n\nThe Boucherie Plate of beautiful charcuterie is just excellent. The fried boudin with pickled peppers are great too. The exterior of the boudin balls are fried to a breaded crunch, while the pork and rice insides were so soft and savory. The brininess of the pickled peppers and the creole mustard accented the whole t'do perfectly. The smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle have been tasty, tasty business as well. How many people have noted that you can go, \"Hog wild,\" here? Add me that number, cause you can. It's punny but it's true.\n\nAnd I'm not even done listing pork dishes. The Louisiana Cochon? My husband ordered it as his main course this time. Slow-cooked pork is formed into a golden crusty succulence, in the shape of a hockey puck. Served with turnips, cabbage, cracklins and pickled peaches, it is just killa. Delicious.\n\nReally, a couplea pals could  easily make a great meal out of a selection of the small plates here, and it is a great plan, and one that I'd most likely stick to in the future. It's just that I now know about the rabbit and dumplings too... Served up in a cast iron pan was some tender, shredded rabbit in some glorious pot-pie style gravy and topped with perfect dumplings for the sopping. Well, clearly that was cozy. Damn, that entree was delicious. Lip-smacking, even. I use that term quite literally as I repeated during a recent dinner there, \"This is lip-smacking, I'm literally smacking my lips right now.\" After blurting that out, I made a myself a mental note: Make sure you mention that. \n\nThe food at Cochon is great in that it hits on an universal soul food level which is basically my attempt at labeling the feeling of instant recognition that happens when enjoying a real true comfort-food moment. The dishes we've shared here have been a delicious synthesis of  Southern and authentic Cajun cuisine with a heightened touch of modernization and sophistication. All washed down with a pitcher of Abita. Nice ya can get a pitcher. I feel the need to mention that I appreciated being able to enjoy a nice cold pitcher with our wholehearted feasting.\n\nIn fact, that's the overall vibe of this place, to me, more than anything: Feasting. Passing plates and plates around, geekin on how good. It's true that the rustic-meets-modern warehouse of a restaurant feels more than a little trendy too, but moreso, it's abuzz with what feels like the shared energy of mass enjoyment of good meals.  Of course I can only speak for my man and myself, but enjoy, we certainly did. Massively.", "date": "2012-11-27 05:17:18"}

The roving commitment-phobes of the food world, always looking over the menu to see what we're missing, afraid to order the same thing twice.\n\nBut our hearts are, if we're honest, often most at home in just one place, in the one food world or dish or venue where we know everything is right and honest and uncomplicated and just so good. For me, that world is the vast one of Southern foodways, currently under rediscovery by many who maybe didn't know until just now about Edna Lewis or kale or salt pork or Husk or grits or biscuits or anything. Oh, what they've missed.\n\nAnd what I missed, from my years living in the South, was this, the food, the place with such a vastly rich culinary history and such tiny and fascinating microclimates of cuisine. So lovely to find, then, a home in Cochon, and the genius of Donald Link. But to find them so perfectly, and in ways reinvented such that both my faithless palate and faithful heart were so satisfied that I kept stopping during the meal as I couldn't remember just where in the world I was. West Coast? The South? Home? Far away? New? Old? Not sure. \n\nTake the Catdaddy Carolina Moonshine. (We did, since it was on the house for my dear birthday girl.) I've had some in my day, usually out of a glass jar passed around late at night at some music festival. But this was like drinking Christmas, with some vanilla nutmeg infusion all smooth and sweet and spicy so that my slowness in finishing it had everything to do with desperately not wanting to finish the last drop while at the same time anxiously awaiting the next. (Cochon is credited with putting some muscle and energy into the small-but-growing Southern moonshine industry for the needs of their bar program.)\n\nOr take the pineapple upside down cake, all tiny on the plate and crumbly with cornmeal to add just the right bit of savory. Or any combination of pork, beans, and greens all fancied up in different ways and variations but everything perfectly spiced, fresh to the bite, and just-fancier than I'd make it at home...so it's worth flying across the country for. I wanted one of everything on the menu, not because I was afraid of missing anything lovely (okay, there WAS that), but more because every plate looked like a welcome-back. And although I ate about five times as much as the pretty-much-vegan birthday girl whose celebratory dinner this was supposed to be, she did have a kick-ass plate of grits (butter doesn't kill on occasion!) and some excellent cucumbers, light and vinegary.  \n\nI'd say I'm coming back, but since it's thousands of miles away...oh, hell, I'm coming back.

Our first experience was very good and because of that we decided to go again on our second trip. To say I was disappointed is not enough. From the beginning the waiter showed no interest in assisting us with the menu even though we asked for help. The menu is very small, last time they had specials, this time none. Nevertheless we had a hard time picking an item. When my wife asked if she could substitute the potatoes for something else the answer was \"absolutely no substitutions\" then as my wife looked at him with an incredulous stare because she cannot eat gluten, the waiter said, \"but you can buy a side\". Really? We have eaten all over in high end to hole in the wall locales and never had an issue. This pretentious attitude is just not acceptable. So as it was our last night in New Orleans and we didn't want to deal with a headache or have our night ruined we just ordered something else. I had the pork which was not only salty, it was dry. And don't let me forget the peanut salad that was the biggest joke, seriously if you call four lettuce leaves with a few peanut halves on top a \"salad\" and slap a $9 dollar price tag on it and are proud of your efforts, you seriously need a reality check. We actually had lunch a few days prior at Cochon Butcher and it was pretty good, at that moment we wished badly we had just walked next door and ordered a sandwich. The most frustrating part is we have planned this trip since August and reservations were made since October. We are not food snobs, we just expect good food and great service. Having a waiter completely ignore you, not ask if you needed more wine or beer and never come once to your table to ask how everything was is just not acceptable. We definitely will not be going back and we were left with a bitter taste in our mouth. Hope your experience is better than ours.", "date": "2012-12-27 15:55:11"}

And then it becomes hard to a run a restaurant as a business, which is after all what they are.\n\nBecause if you want to be great, it takes more than talent. To be great, the prices of your ingredients rise, the number of covers you can turn around in any given night drops to the edge of profitability, and you cut things like lunches and brunches to focus instead on evening service with a small kitchen staff and experimental dishes that some patrons will find, well, too adventurous for their palates and pocketbooks.\n\nWhen such places persist long enough to become profitable (which usually takes years and lots on investor patience), then they become \"great.\" They survive because of gastronomers and people with money to spare on food as art. A Michelin star - not mention great Yelp reviews - certainly can help.\n\nCouchin does not aspire to greatness, imo. But it chooses the next best thing: they created a menu and setting with enough space for foodies and for more casual eaters-out, from 20-something couples to families with children to college students on break to conventioneers out for some fun, food, and libations after a long day of sessions and organizing.\n\nYou can definitely get a good and healthful meal here if you order right and avoid the heavy hitters (like the fried gator parts or pork-based sausages).\n\nStart with a really good wine, in the $30-50 range; a Kermit Lynch selection - 2010 Ch\u00e2teau de Lascaux Languedoc-Roussillon red (Syrah/Grenache/Mourvedre) at $42 hit the mark for us;\n\nOrder a plate of oven-roasted oysters as starter; add some of the house sweet potato habanero sauce if you'd like (it goes great on the brioche style bread, too).\n\nSoups and salads are nicely thought out. The kale and beet salad with deviled eggs and a basic vinaigrette was nice, as was a cream of broccoli option. Perfect winter fare.\n\nFor mains, you'd be hard pressed to do better than the oven-roasted Gulf fish, served as a fillet skin-side down with lemon, pickled onion, and parsley on the side; and the rabbit and dumplings, served in a root vegetable and potato stew in a single-serve cast iron skillet.\n\nAll that for about $115 (2/3 for the food), and when you add it all up, it's a really good meal.\n\nNot Craigie on Main great.

I've usually only had the asian way of preparing pork (which i love) or the sorta dried american pork chop (which I don't prefer), but this place opened up a whole new world of pork to me.  I had the  Louisiana cochon (shredded pork reshaped into a patty).  Very tasty  but alittle bit too much pork at one time for me (I'm a small person so I don't eat much each time), but for a normal person, good portion.  My b/f's ham hock....tasted amazing (well at least the small taste I had).  \n\nWould definately come back here again.  Would save room for dessert.

I had oysters at Acme a bit later in the trip and although those were good, I'd say these were still better!\n* Fried alligator with chili garlic aioli: First time trying alligator.  I really liked it but I think it's because anything that's deep-fried well and has a nice slightly spicy sauce to it is gonna be good :)\n* Smoked cobia fritters with apple calas: These tasted almost like corned beef hash in a deep fried ball.  Probably a healthier version than what I described because it's fish (like salted cod), or at least that's what I'll tell myself.  Yum.\n* Cane syrup glazed pork cheeks with mushrooms & roasted corn grits: Soft and sweet and yummy!\n* Pork & black eyed pea gumbo: This was my favorite gumbo of the trip too.  I didn't have enough because I figured I would be having lots of gumbo as the trip went by.  I wish I had eaten more of THIS one.\n\nEntrees:\n* Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage, pickled peaches & cracklins: I actually ordered this one (the restaurant is named Cochon after all.. it must be good?), and some of it was good, but this was my least favorite dish.  The pork was dry and could've used a bit more flavor.\n* Smoked ham hock with baked peanuts & charred radishes: This is sort of what I wish the cochon were like.. the pork was tender, delicious, and complemented well with the elements on the plate.\n* Rabbit & dumplings: Very soft and delicious.  Just had a small bite of this one but the one who got this said she really enjoyed it.\n* Beef pot roast with horseradish potato salad: Sooooo good.  Tender, delicious, great sauce.\n* Catfish courtbouillon: Didn't get to try much of this one but the bits I did try were good!\n\nAll in all, GREAT meal.  Service was just ok.

My wife got the Strawberry Pocket Pie with sour cream ice cream ($8), which was awesome, and the hot pie with the unique ice cream made for an excellent combo.

After stopping by the convention center we wanted some great food to make the run the next morning worth it. One of my friends had heard about Cochon. While we weren't able to get a reservation (it was a Saturday night after all), we were able to walk in as it was just before 5p. Hey - we were going to be running a half marathon in the morning - we needed sleep.\n\nFirst up, the atmosphere was just the right mix of casual and class. While I definitely felt odd wearing a hat (I'd flown in that morning (and boy were my arms tired)) and was still in my travel outfit, I didn't feel that out of place. This is definitely not a \"jacket required\" place.\n\nWe had a conversation with the waiter who introduced us to the menu and the specials. We ordered cocktails and reviewed the menu to figure out our plan of attack.\n\nThere were many, many dishes that found their way onto the table. Here's everything that I remember:\n\nGumbo (my appetizer) - By far this was the best gumbo I'd ever had. It was a chicken and deviled egg gumbo. Now, I'd never seen a deviled egg in gumbo, but who am I to judge. The color was a wonderful dark reddish-brown. The flavor was amazing, with just the right amount of spice. It's the kind of gumbo I'd love to be able to recreate at my house.\n\nThe broiled drum special (my entree) - An amazing piece of fish. Seasoned remarkably well. Just delicious.\n\nFried alligator - Can't go wrong with fried alligator, and this certainly didn't disappoint.\n\nThe oysters - OK, let's get make something perfectly clear - I don't like oysters. Can't stand them. I hate oysters. *These* oysters, however - these oysters I love. If all oysters were like this then I'd be on board. Loved the spice of the sauce they were doused with. The oysters themselves had a very nice flavor as well. All I can say is \"wow\".\n\nThe couple of cocktails we had were good but unfortunately unremarkable. But that was the only complaint we had. Out of the 4 of us (and the 9 dishes that found their way to the table), that was the only complaint. Everyone loved their food. In fact, if they'd have been open on Sunday we'd have gone back again.\n\nThis is a must stop in New Orleans.", "date": "2013-02-28 01:01:10"}

We were not disappointed.  The restaurant itself is very comfortable and welcoming and the staff is very attentive, without being intrusive.  We made dinner from small plates and a shared rabbit and dumpling entree, which was plenty for the two of us.  \n\nWe started with a woodfired oyster roast and the crawfish and green tomato casserole.  Both were excellent, but the oysters took some adjustment.  Being used to Appalachicola oysters, which are smaller with a more intense flavor, these oysters were milder and BIG, not just an oyster, but a commitment.  Still, the Oyster roast was a satisfying start.  The crawfish and green tomatos in the  casserole perfectly complemented each other and the dish was very good, though I thought the crawfish were a tad diminutive.  The next morning we ate breakfast at the Old Coffepot and I had an crawfish omelete.   In contrast to the crawfish at Cochon,  the crawfish in the omelete were large and succulent.  Still we din't know this when eating at Cochon and were delighted with the casserole.\n\nThese two plates were followed by the aligator with chili-garlic aoili.  This was the surprise of the night, with succulent alligator with just the right snap to the sauce. I was suspiscious of this dish, having had enough tough dry alligator to prevent me from ever eating it again, but this was delicate, delightful and perfectly done.\n\nWe finished the main meal sharing the rabbit and dumpling entree.  The rabbit was perfectly done, savory, with wonderful taste and no bones.  The dumplings were fine, not remarkable, but worked well with the rabbit and sauce.  We had ordered an egg plant in shrimp sauce side dish, but somehow it got forgotten, which was fine since this was plenty of food for the two of us, though I was intrigued to see what this dish tasted like.\n\nCochon has very nice beers on tap and serves them by the glass and in pitchers.  We shared a pitcher of pale ale with the meal and it really was the perfect complement to the dishes.\n\nAll in all this was an excellent and very satisfying dining experience.  However, our dinner at Herbsaint  a few evenings later was almost perfect and a much more memorable dining experience than Cochon.  Thus we were lucky to experience these two excellent restaurants in this order. Had we dined at Herbsaint first, I suspect we would have been disappointed in Cochon, which would have been unfair to the restaurant.", "date": "2013-03-04 13:37:29"}

Donald Link is a true restaurateur in NOLA.  I have yet to dine at one of his restaurants where I haven't been blown away.  If you are in NOLA and buy into the hype of Emeril's restaurants (sorry, no offense buddy) you are doing yourself an injustice if you don't try at least one of Donald Link's eateries.  \n\nLocated in the warehouse district, Cochon saved me during a recent visit when I needed to make a lunch reservation for a party of 10 on short notice..... with 150,000 other people all trying to find reservations as well.  First, their patience with me while I changed my reservation 3 different times was much appreciated.  We started out as a party of 10, then increased to 12, and we showed up at the restaurant with 13 folks.  The hostess was polite (even though she was probably beyond frustrated with me) and found a way to get us all seated without hassle.  \n\nThis is true NOLA food..... a perfect combination of French/Cajun that will not disappoint.  Their menu is very \"different\" but if you feel like stepping outside of your comfort zone, you will find yourself in true culinary bliss.  My clients absolutely loved their meals and I wish I had another day in the city to come back on my own for dinner...... that is how impressed I was!\n\nOne of the many unique things about Cochon is that they serve the same menu all day long.... the good thing is that if you feel like an entree for lunch, you will be very happy because their entrees looked killer.  The bad is that if you want to head in for a light lunch, your options are rather limited.  We started out with a few orders of the Boudin, Wood Fired Oysters, and Fried Alligator..... one was better than the next.  All had unique flavor that I wouldn't get tired of anytime soon.  The oysters were probably some of the best I have ever had (that is saying a lot, as I live in the Chesapeake area of Maryland where they take pride in their oysters.)\n\nFor entrees, most of the folks at the table ordered the fried oyster sandwich, which was the only sandwich on the menu.  I ordered the gumbo (with deviled eggs and shrimp) and the braised pork cheeks.  Both were delicious and left me feeling very satisfied.  One person at our table ordered the Gulf Fish \"Fisherman's Style\" which looked delicious (and spicy) and two others ordered the Louisiana Cochon, which was a pork dish that they both raved over.\n\nI may need to fly back down to NOLA soon to try the Rabbit and Dumplings.... it looked amazing, but is served in a huge cast iron skillet and I didn't have the guts to order such a huge entree at lunch time during a business lunch!  I have been salivating at the thought of this dish ever since though!  \n\nTHE GOOD - Every.Single. Item. On. The. Menu.\nTHE MEH - Lack of sandwiches, suitable lunch sized portions.\nTHE BAD - LOL", "date": "2013-03-19 18:47:26"}

I decided to make this one of the rare occasions where I eat meat. Plus the  meat was served in  a balanced way  with vegetables and I  also ordered Lima beans on the  side. (truth be told I gave most of it to my hubby and I ate the  desserts) But I did eat  and enjoy some of it!\n I mostly eat fish/seafood  but I am  allergic to shell fish.  Shell fish is a very common  allergy.   So it made finding dining options difficult for me in  NOLA ! I was not always allergic to shell fish so I have the torment of knowing what it tastes like  and  I can't eat it!\nWhile at  Cochon the  manager came over to me and spoke to me about my shell fish  allergy  and said not to  eat the  alligator because it was fried in the same oil as shell fish.  It  is always  nice when  a restaurant  is aware  of allergies! The  wood-fired oyster roast and  alligator  smelled so tempting  I almost tried it! I did not have  my  Epi pen so the manager stopped me. Pretty  stupid of me.  I never do that but it really smelled so amazing I was  willing  to die to  taste it.  Not really but  almost.\n    I am also not a \"Bizarre\" foods eater.  I like Andrew Zimern.  http://sf.eater.com/tags/andrew-zimmern\nBut it is for his personality not his foods that I watch. \nBut as for as Couchon it was the desserts  that convinced me to go.\nThe pastry chef  has an impressive resume.\nIn  any case all of the  food we had was  superior! For an appetizer he had fried alligator with chili garlic aioli.  I was not able to  eat  it  since it was  cooked in  the  same  oil as shell fish but it  smelled amazing! He also got the  wood-fired oyster roast as an appetizer. He said they  were awesome!\nI had the Louisiana Cochon with turnips, cabbage, pickled turnips & cracklins  and it was some of the  best pork I have ever had outside of Hawaii! I was however  disappointed that it was served with turnips and not peaches. The original menu says  peaches  but  I know peaches are not in  season. Never the less one of the best meals of pork I have ever had!\n My hubby  said so too! I only  eat meat \nWe also ordered  smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle and shared it. The ribs were bursting  with flavor!\nThe  bread served with the  meal was hot and served with  warm  butter! Some  of the best fresh baked bread I  have had  in  a long  time, maybe  ever! It was soft hot and chewy!\nMy  hubby  had cabbage braised pork cheeks with radish, cucumbers & field peas   for lunch. The  pork  was good it  reminded me of Kalua pig.  (Hawaiian luau  food) We shared everything  except the  shell fish.\nHe had for an appetizer alligator.  We have had alligator in NYC  at  a restaurant that  was known as the top Cajun  restaurant  in  NYC  before it closed called Cooking  with  Jazz. He  said  the  alligator tasted nothing like this! He  said  it  was amazing!\nFor me  it was a struggle to choose which dessert   so I got several desserts. :) See pictures.\n I got that  from  Atif I who says he doesn't  believe  in  choosing between  desserts! http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cD_hpkvErXCyQHBQzv8KYQ\nMy hubby  also had Pineapple Upside-Down Cake with Coconut-Lime Sherbet + Dulce de Leche.\n\nI had a strawberry  tart  made with Louisiana  strawberries and sour cream ice  cream. It  was heavenly. I  also had Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie.  It was great  but I was so full already.\n\n \n My hubby  also   had banana pudding  for dessert! It  was awesome! It had sour cherries in it! I ate most of it!\nThey  gave us Moonshine with  our  dessert!\n\nWe never had it before! I can't drink  alcohol so my hubby  tried it! He said  it was really strong! I could smell it. It smelled like  egg  nog! It smelled very sophisticated.  \n\nThe  servers were all professional  and very friendly as well as knowledgeable about food and Nola.  They  all pretended to be shocked at my age  which  is a plus for me.:)\nMy hubby gives me  whatever I want within  his means.

Southern hospitality was definitely on display as everyone was so friendly and welcoming to us.  The kitchen and dining room are well run operations.\n\nEach table is provided with a basket of warm dinner rolls .  Yes, they are very, very good.  I was lucky to be able to snap one picture before everyone reached over and grabbed one!  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#IgYehMsJhBbKXB3TUFOPEw)\n\nWe started with the wood fired oyster roast , fried alligator with chili aioli  and roasted broccoli salad .  The oysters were hot, plump, juicy and slightly spicy, having been roasted in the shell ((http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#yfnek8weX-3Q20AzHCMI6A)).   We really enjoyed these!  The alligator bites were mild tasting and reminded me of chicken ((http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#w8jCGRBx97zJskfq77g3-w)).  It's not my first time eating alligator and to be honest they didn't really stand out to me.  That being said, they were well fried and the sauce was provided a nice balance to the richness of the fried nuggets.  The broccoli salad was delicious and came with green beans, buts and a creamy dressing with a hint of heat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#rXXfMyteQv7AsnGaSaVkyg).  I found this dish to be delicious and appreciated the fact that it was not overdressed.\n\nOur main courses, all shared, were the smoked ham hock, Louisiana cochon and the oven-roasted fish with a side of sauteed kale.  Of the three I personally liked the fish the most, but note that the scales have been left on one side of the fish fillet and they sometimes worked their way into my bites of fish.  The fish itself was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#bUJpMilduelE3c3olERv0Q).  It reminded me of sea bass.  The ham hock came with a mustard cream sauce and was smoky and moist (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#k56cmSs_Ne2Zs1oPrioRVg).  The cochon is a patty of smoky pulled pork (I'm simplifying this dish but it takes hours to prepare) and came with cracklin's (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#pctmKRl9Q5hLsbZSCj7cKg).  All of the dishes were good and I would recommend each of them.  The kale was quite good.  Given that I was the one eating most of the vegetables at this meal, I was happy to eat a simply prepared dish of greens with all the rich meat dishes.\n\nFor dessert we indulged in the strawberry pocket pie, strudel and chocolate peanut butter pie.  Our waiter told us that the first two items were popular but all of us at the table loved the chocolate peanut butter pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cochon-new-orleans#wxpfTfEOHKHQOdRYYUj8bQ).  We LOVED that pie.  It was light, creamy, fluffy and not too sweet.  It was the perfect balance of salty, peanut-y, chocolate-y goodness.

The atmosphere is charming and reminds you somewhat of a German Brasserie. The food is pretty outstanding. My favorite dish is the \"Wood Grilled Oyster Roast\" which is actually grilled/roasted oysters in an amazing sauce. The wood grillling gives them such amazing and unique flavor. We could really just order a couple of orders of this each time, but there are definitely other menu items that are worth trying as well. They have a number of small plates which allow you to try different things, and they also have full entree portions for order as well. I love the crawfish and green tomato casserole and the crab salad. I'm not a person that typically orders gumbo because my mom makes the best, but I tried it here and thought the shrimp and devilled egg gumbo was fantastic. My fiance loves the oyster and bacon sandwich. Keep in mind the menu is seasonal so some of the items change and aren't always available. All of the sides are delicious--mac and cheese casserole, lima beans, eggplant and shrimp dressing are our favorites. My only slight negative was that the Catfish Court Boullion was just average and I wouldn't be inclined to order it again. Service is always wonderful and the food is always great.

My concern with dining by myself at a restaurant with so many tasty looking menu items is that one has limited stomach space (and, at least for me, purchasing power), and can only sample, at most, a few items. By a stroke of amazing luck, however, I was seated next to three friendly nurses from Texas, and we ended up sharing plates across the 4 of us for the duration of the meal.\n\nBetween the 4 of us, we sampled nearly everything on the menu. Service was prompt and attentive, and all of the food was perfectly executed. I could have happily eaten plate after plate of just about everything except for the smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle; don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but the sauce was a little too much salty/sweet for me to fully enjoy them as a meal. I'd recommend them if you were going to split them between 4-6 people.\n\nMy perfect meal just might be the wood-fired oysters to start, Louisiana cochon as an entr\u00e9e (it was like the meal of my dreams: pork topped with pork crackling and served with some of my favorite things, cabbage and turnips) with a side of smothered greens. Not into pork? (blasphemy!) Their braised beef shoulder is phenomenal, too. I'm not much into dessert, but their pineapple upside down cake is divine; if you like very sweet and rich desserts, their chocolate & peanut butter pie will hit the spot.\n\nOverall, highly recommended.

The reason I mention this is because Cochon is awesome by comparison to 90% of the good places out there (no, I am not suggesting it beats the Michelin star achieving restaurants I have experienced).\nFried Alligator: very good, tender and well-seasoned.  I have had this before at a few places, this definitely is tops.\nRabbit and Dumplings: excellent, I almost ordered another portion to take home. Well-seasoned, and the dumplings were moist and fluffy. This dish smelled and looked so good that the two guys next to me at the bar ordered it after seeing what I had, and loved it as well.\nHad a flight of rye after dinner, good mix and price for it.\nOverall, price is in line with the food quality, but a definite steal compared to what I used to pay when living in NYC for a similar dining experience.\nI struggled between 4 and 5 stars. I think this is a 4.5, so rounding up to 5.", "date": "2013-05-01 03:56:00"}

Why one down?  After a long day at the New Orleans Jazz fest with my butt parked on bleacher benches, the hard, flat wooden chairs that are arty at Cochon were not a welcome experience.  Tell the interior designer from TrendyCo that hipness and comfort are not mutually exclusive, and that, while they captured immense visual appeal, some acoustic sound deadening material here and there would make it slightly quieter than a wind tunnel.\n\nThat being said, with the caveat that I HATE starting off a great restaurant's review with that, but they are subject to the same standards of presentation in their decor as their food, the rest of the evening was a TOUR DE FORCE of great culinary artistry.\n\nFlavor, textures, presentation were all exceptional.\n\nThe wood-fired oyster roast was perfection. The oysters just melted in your mouth, and were seasoned so well that they lifted the normally briny after-taste into a cheesy spicy cloud of wonder.\n\nThe rabbit and dumplings were also over-the-top good. They were just spicy enough to remind you that you're in Louisiana, and the skillet that they were served in kept the meal nice and hot, which, for a dumplings dish, is always a plus.\n\nIn most restaurants, the sides are an after-thought and most don't rise to the occasion of mention. All of them are good here. Some green beans with tasso ham that were a side t the special were wonderful, but the macaroni and cheese and the twice-baked potato were rock-star cooking.  The macaroni was not swampy, not too dry, and seasoned well enough to not taste like it was wallowing in fat.  The twice-baked potato has hints of mustard, white and cayenne peppers, and scallions, topped with some sharp cheese that gives it a wonderful crispy crust.\n\nDessert was the only modest let-down. The pineapple-upside down cake with coconut-key lime sorbet: The sorbet was a religious experience, but the cake, which is corn-meal based, came out surprisingly dry and grainy.  It may have been a bad one, but corn meal baked goods are always tricky.\n\nThe bar, if you can get to it in the crowd, is excellent and, for craft bourbon fans, is filled with eclectic amazement.\n\nThe service was exceptionally good without being too in your face.\n\nEven the hostesses were top grade. They were kind and gracious which, in a restaurant frequented by testy tourists that is small and prone to waits, was a great managerial pick for people with the right temperament to be the face of the place.\n\nFix the damn chairs before I come back next year.

Service was so indifferent, you would have thought they were paying us to visit the restaurant, just one of those places where you got the impression that they wanted you out as quickly as possible so they could turn the table. No smiles, no warmth, just robots dropping plates on the table and scurrying away as fast as possible. The small plates were good, but nothing you couldn't find at any decent restaurant around the country, or in soooo many other places in the city.  Then came the large plates, which were simply not good.  The Louisiana Cochon was dry, overcooked, and so overly salted that it was basically inedible.  Seriously, this is not an exaggeration.  Same with the smothered greens, and when we questioned the waitress about the two dishes, there was no attempt to make it right, perhaps switch out the dishes with something that we might enjoy, just a shrug and an off handed comment that the greens are always salty as she disappeared from the table. Really? We know greens are usually salty, we're not food idiots here, can't you take thirty seconds to attempt to show a bit of concern?  Rabbit and dumplings tasted like a tricked out chicken pot pie --why do people love this dish?? Catfish was overcooked and also dried out.  Maybe our expectations were too high, or it was just an off night, but with so many other choices of tremendous restaurants in the city, DO NOT be sucked in by the hype -- our experience with mediocre food and bad service makes Cochon one of the most overrated restaurants we have ever dined in.", "date": "2013-05-20 17:02:40"}

Me as a chef I become very upset and aggravated when people are trying to take short cuts on the expense of the guest/customers.  Moving on... smoked pork ribs. Same story. Oversmoked and if it wasnt for the sauce flavorless.  Chicken and andouille sausage gumbo. Was I thought wrong all this time? Should gumbo have the trinity with the meat and okra in it? Should it be thicker than broth soup? Was I thought wrong? It ddidn't even have the naughty flavour from darkening your roux. And at the end mac and cheese. Bechamel sauce with overcooked pasta and some American cheese for color. Come on now. Give me a break please.

There were a few open tables but those soon filled as we ordered drinks.\n\nThe guys shared a pitcher on blond ale and our female counterpart a cider\n\nWe started out with the:\nComplimentary House Bread: Warm Golden Brown Yeast rolls with a nice creamy butter\n\nCrawfish Pie-Nice app for two people and looked delicious\n\nPork Cheek Terrine-I split this with one of the guys and It was awesome.  The terrine had every bit of rich ever-so salted porkiness that matched perfect with the spring onions and burst tomatoes.  I was amazed at all the different flavors that could be enjoyed in a single bite.\n\nThen the fun began,\nTo our great surprise and already happy stomachs the server brought out an order of Fried Boudin Balls with pickled peppers and creole mustard.  She stated it was a gift from the kitchen. Ive eaten at several fine dining restaurants and had several amuse bouche, but never been treated with such a gracious gift from the chef.  The boudin balls were crispy on the outside while the inside remain moist, flavorful and the rice cooked perfectly.  The peppers and mustard took them to next level.\n\nAs we were eating the boudin the server approached again and said this is a gift from the kitchen.  It was and heirloom tomato salad w/feta olive oil and S&P.  This salad was refreshing and a nice way to cleanse the palate prior to the serving of entrees.  At this point I am a pint into the meal and everything thus far has been tremendous.  \n\nOut came our entrees and sides:\nOyster and Bacon Sandwich- This was on loaf style bread and was lager than expected.  The couple split this and both appeared pleased and content\nMacNcheese-Not over baked, rich, creamy and quite cheesy\nRabbit and Dumplings- Not your traditional dumplings. more like biscuits floating in one of the most flavorful well balanced stews I have ever had.  The rabbit was delicious\nEggplant and shrimp Dressing- This was my least favorite item and it was still tasty.  The flavor was there just the eggplant was a tad bit too al dente for me and the skin on it was a bit tough.  I think this was more a flaw in execution rather than conception.  This side came out a few minutes after we received our entrees so the kitchen was in a bit of a rush. No big deal\n*Special*\nSauteed Soft Shell Crab w/ green tomato vinaigrette and corn- I tried this dish and it was very good. It was nice to see the crab prepared sauteed' rather than overly battered and dropped in a deep fryer.  The green tomato vinaigrette was very flavorful and a nice acidic compliment to the crab and sweet corn. \n\nBring on the Second Pitcher of Blonde\n\nAs we are eating our Entrees the Chef/Kitchen added even more to an unbelievable dinner.  The Kitchen sent us an order of their Sauteed Shrimp and pasta with greens in a preserved lemon broth.  I could not believe the generosity of the Chef/Kitchen.  I would likely have never ordered this if given the choice.  However, after tasting it I surely would.  The Shrimp, greens and homemade pasta were cooked perfectly and the preserved lemon broth was the perfect refreshing finish for the dish.\n\n\nOur meal lasted just over and hour from seating to the check.  I'm not exactly a ball of emotion but this meal and service seemed to make me smile.  This was easily the best meal I have had in New Orleans.\n\nThe food was wonderful, The staff was attentive and knowledgeable and the Chef/Kitchen extremely generous\n\nI will be back it was worth every cent", "date": "2013-06-05 15:30:09"}

Even with this big party the service was on point, and the waiter was friendly even with our complicated split of the bill. \n\nPork cheek taurine over pickled onions was probably my favorite dish. Great crispy texture, tenderish insides, and good balance with the onions. Small portion, good enough to warrant ordering 2 if your party is bigger than 2.\n\nWood-fired oyster roast also something you should not leave without trying. Chili garlic butter sauce with a splash of lime on it not overly spicy either.\n\nOyster and bacon sandwich. Simple, but definitely done right and enjoyable. \n\nThinly sliced toungue was surprisingly good.\n\nThe ham hoc, signature Cochon, rabbit & dumplings, and black drum (on special), were all solid, but I found that the smaller plates generally were more satisfying than the entrees.

Too often, contemporary chefs appear to fear the spicy, but not at Cochon. The fried alligator was perfectly complemented by a blast of pepper in the aioli, which took the dish from great to fantastic. I was also pleasantly surprised by the notes of spice in the Louisiana Cochon, probably as \"signature\" of a dish that you'd find here (although everything could be considered a \"signature\"). The pork was mouth-wateringly tender. The greens were just acidic enough to balance out the flavor profile. There really was not a misstep.\nTwice-baked potatoes were fantastic. Rabbit and Dumplings were heavenly. I could go on and on. The only dish that appeared to miss was the Oyster Po Boy, although I did not try it (so I can't really fairly rate it).\nThe ambiance was laid back, casual. The staff was a bit rough around the edges, but they knew their food and aside from forgetting a few things, they were attentive and pleasant to deal with. The other diners seemed to be occupying the same place in gastro heaven as I. Not a bad word from any of the diners who accompanied me.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about Cochon.

Even with about two weeks notice, the only reservation they had on a Friday was at 5pm for four of us.  I was IN. I had to come here after reading about Cochon in all the magazines and lists that have turned up this year.  I didn't want to read into the menu too much before I got there, but I knew that I wanted something amazing, and something specific to Cochon and New Orleans.  Onto the food!\n\nThe four of us went with the following appetizers:\n-Fried alligator with chili garlic aioli \n-Beef tartare with potato chips\n-Two cocktails for the table: The Swinekiller and one strawberry bourbon drink whose name escapes me\n\nThe fried alligator was delicious, and I loved the chili garlic aioli.  I didn't get to sample the beef tartare, but the reaction was that it was OK (we SF folks are used to outstanding tartares).  I didn't want to eat too much because we had the following showing up to the table:\n\n-Louisiana Cochon (MINE. MINE. MINE)\n-Rabbit & Dumplings\n-Oyster Po Boy\n-Oven-roasted gulf fish \"fisherman's style\"\n-Side of the macaroni & cheese casserole\n\nI didn't share my dish, the cracklins that game garnished with the dish was amazing.  The pork itself was soft and tender, exactly what you would expect from a James Beard award recipient.  Greg ordered the rabbit & dumplings, and was sort of surprised to see it coming out in the form of a stew, but said that the dish itself was delicious.  The other two people at our table said that the oyster po boy was incredible, and there was no additional fish to taste since it was gone.  The mac and cheese that came to the table was INCREDIBLE.  I definitely recommend getting the Lousiana Cochon, you will NOT be disappointed.\n\nFinally, there always has to be dessert.  And Cochon really came through, the red velvet ice cream sandwich was completely on point.  It was incredibly hot when we were there, so the ice cream tasted even better.  All in all, it was an amazing way to kick off our trip in NOLA.  We walked from or hotel in the French Quarter, which was about 20 minutes and got a nice walking view of the CBD.

I usually enjoy smoked meats, but the ham hocks seemed oversmoked...the smoky flavor was overwhelming.\nTo add insult to injury, when we received the bill we were charged for the side dishes and the beef special that we never received. It took three attempts to get the bill correct.\nA NOLA cabbie had warned us not to go to Cochon, just to stick with Cochon Butcher (which we loved!) - We should have listened to her!", "date": "2013-06-28 16:35:41"}

There was definitely some good eatin', so that is saying a LOT!\n\nWe were a group of 8 ladies (1/2 the weekend's contingent) for an early dinner our first night-- thurs-- in the city.  We were only able to get a 5:30pm rez for that many folks, even with making it two (2) months in advance!  To say this is a popular restaurant is clearly an understatement, though it was a Jazz Fest weekend, perhaps the reason for the early fill!  \n\nWith our group size, and a small plate concept, we were easily able to try lots of things and there were only a couple of dishes I found merely 'meh.  Everything else was delish-- fried alligator (w/ chili garlic aioli), wood-fired oyster roast, pork cheek terrine, rabbit with dumplings, oyster & bacon sandwich, choco & pb pie.  There were a couple of dishes that paled in comparison to the previous items-- I wasn't totally digging the crawfish and green tomato casserole, crawfish pie, or black velvet pie (dessert).  But that was definitely a taste and not quality issue-- others may feel differently.  We were lucky in that we were all carnivores-- the vegetarians of the weekend were not arriving until the next day.  Though there are veggie options on the menu, this is definitely a restaurant for meat enjoyers, as the concept is definitely butcher-chic.  Just FYI.\n\nService was perfect-- I don't remember having any issues.  Things came out efficiently and timely and Southern hospitality was def in play :)\n\nI can easily see why this is #14 on the list of Top 20 restaurants in America.", "date": "2013-07-07 17:59:57"}

She suggested that even though we did not have a reservation, it was going to be hard for her to accommodate our party of five. Mind you this is at 4 PM and the place is empty. It was quite the unpleasant encounter and not a great way to begin a meal. Cochon, you do need to go picking through your staff, identify the snooty ones, and then... well, I don't know... put them on pickling duty?

I enjoyed the oyster/BLT, which was a tasty little calorie bomb. The sides I sampled were also pretty decent: a cornbread/eggplant casserole, twice-baked potato, and homemade pickle.

I might've thrown a small fit since I wasn't looking to get spendy, but I was reassured it was a business lunch, and to catch the tip. The fluffy homemade buns they brought out didn't hurt either. \n\nI really enjoy an aesthetically pleasing yet functional restaurant, and Cochon nails it with great textures, lots of blocky wood and an open kitchen.\n\nI will say though if you have any sort of anxiety about sitting on one of those communal booth benches with two seaters arranged fairly close, this might not be your stop sans reservations on a Friday night.  \n\nMonday summer lunch was pretty slow, crowd-wise, to what I've seen in the past. We ordered two appetizers, the louisiana blue crab with buttermilk & chive dressing served in an cleaned out crab shell and fried boudin with pickled peppers. Our waiter also brought out the pork cheeks with baby limas, mushrooms & peach relish compliments of the chef, though I think he was just sweet on my coworker. Either way, the pork cheeks were phenomenal and I could've eaten a boat filled with the crab dressing. The boudin served with a grainy creole mustard wasn't necessarily my bag. I would say if you're trying boudin for the first time, see if you can get it in sausage form 'cause fried doesn't do this Cajun staple justice. I ordered the special, and it was pretty tasty and cooked very well.\n\nI like that the food came out fast despite it being slow in the restaurant since I've found many New Orleans restaurants tend to be slower getting food out when it's not busy.  I know I didn't foot the bill, but the entrees on the menu are a little pricey for lunch, though the special was in considerable range for the quality. \n\nAgain, the buns don't hurt to curb the hangries, and I wouldn't be opposed to doing a few appetizers and a cocktail from their very appealing cocktail list on my next visit.", "date": "2013-07-31 00:03:53"}

The food was good, but the poor service left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nI had a friend in town, his first trip to New Orleans, and I put Cochon on our list of places to eat. We went on a Saturday night (it was busy, but I could tell the night was slowing down because we had a reservation at 9:30). My first impression was that this was trying to be a hip, trendy place, similar to the new and happening restaurants you would find in the northeast. \n\nWe were first approached by our waitress for drinks and ordered two cocktails before placing our meal order. We had been eating so much lately that we weren't sure how much food we could handle. I asked our waitress if we could start with some appetizers and then order entrees, and she told me that she and the chef preferred that we place our meal all at once. I mentioned that if that were the case then we needed to look at the menu again, but before I could finish I was cut off by our waitress who said \"What can I get for you?\" The words sound polite when written, but I could tell she wasn't happy with us and this left me a bit frustrated. \n\nOur appetizers came out: Oysters, Boudin, and Okra salad. All were pretty good, by not mind-blowing. \n\nI noticed all of the other tables were receiving bread. We hadn't received any bread. I wanted to ask if we could have some, but when our waitress came to take our entree order she swiftly disappeared. Then the back server started clearing away our appetizers when we weren't' even finished eating! I was becoming a bit more frustrated.\n\nThen, our waitress received another table next to ours and greeted them. She was so polite and nice to them, and started telling them about all of these specials they had. After hearing all of the specials, I because a bit more frustrated, because she hadn't even attempted to tell us the specials. Hearing a few of the items on the list, I surely would have ordered one or two of them instead of what we ordered off the menu. At that moment, I felt almost unwanted as a guest. Had we done something offensive that would lead us to not receiving the same treatment as everyone else? Perhaps we didn't look like we would be spending big bucks and that is why. Still, I was not happy.\n\nOur entree came out: Rabbit and dumplings. It was ok. Honestly, I was so unhappy at that point that I couldn't be pleased by the food. \n\nIt was at this time that I realized our waitress never came back to our table. The back server was kind to us, and made us feel better by checking on us, but the waitress who took our order never came to see us again. \n\nWe asked for dessert but they had run out of everything except for chocolate cake. We passed. \n\nNeedless to say, it didn't feel like we were appreciated as guests. Perhaps I had high expectations considering how much people talked about this place, but I don't think I'll be returning.", "date": "2013-08-09 12:50:36"}

He slammed all of our plates down on the table and caused the watermelon relish on the ribs to splatter all over my white shirt. He did all of this without saying a word.

Was here last Memorial Day weekend on a trip to New Orleans with another couple.  WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT.  The four of us sat at the bar before our table was ready, bartenders generally ignored the patrons, each of us had to ask the bartenders to order a drink.  \n\nWhen we sat down to eat they were out of one of the main pork dishes on the menu, I was disappointed but understand it happens - what I wasn't so understanding about was how the server told me about the 86'ed menu item \"what do you expect, we are one of the hottest restaurants in town\".  In a normal dining setting most servers are very gracious and apologetic and are quick to recommend another menu dish they think you will enjoy.  After we ordered we asked if the server would mind taking a picture of the four of us as the restaurant wasn't that busy, the guy replied with \"how about I just go and put your order in instead\".  After that pleasantry we were waiting a little bit for our food so the server told us he would bring us some bread.  After 5 minutes without getting the bread we inquired with the server who rolled his eyes and told us it was \"still baking in the oven\".  Again, another inappropriate thing to say to a guest.  Our food finally arrived and was good, but by that time we just wanted to leave.  We left a 10% tip which I thought was generous and left.

Once we were greeted, the service was average but prompt. \n\nWe ended up splitting dishes so we could try multiple things without slipping into a food coma afterwards. We started with fried alligator which had a spicy mayo on it. So delicious and easy to eat for someone who is trying alligator for the first time. We also ordered the braised beef (came with a potato/horseradish/apple salad) and mac and cheese casserole. The beef was so tender and moist- I'm not sure it could have been cooked or flavored any better. This was one of the most delicious meals I've ever had and I was still full by the end. It was a bit salty overall, but I think that was expected with our choices.

Made a reservation online, only a couple of days in advance, and overall had a good experience. Let me break it down for you.\n\nInitially got seated right next to the communal table, which was taken over by a bachelor party of about 15, loud, obnoxious males. Sorry guys, but really? Go somewhere on Bourbon street. Pretty sure you ruined the dining experience of every customer in the restaurant, as it is not an exceptionally large place. Other tables were open, so we asked our waitress if we could move tables, since I couldn't hear my friend speaking across from me. The manager came over to us immediately, apologized, and reseated us. He was very sweet, and apologized for the loud group.\n\nWe were lucky to have the chance to erase that first impression and start over. Our waiter was WONDERFUL. Young, cool, informed, friendly, fast but not rushing. We ordered a bottle of wine, and started with some apps and split an entree.\n\n1. Wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter (app) -- HOLY WOW! So delicious. If you like oysters, this is a must-order.\n\n2. Smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickles (app) -- I mean, the place is called \"Pork\" in French, so ordering it off the menu is a must. The pickles were such a nice touch! The ribs fell right off the bone, so you didn't even have to get down and dirty if you didn't want to. Would definitely order again.\n\n3. Shaved zucchini salad and toasted pecan salad (app) -- Needed to order some sort of veggie to balance out everything else. The zucchini was so good! Something different, and the flavors blended seamlessly.\n\n4. Smothered pork loin with apples and caramelized onions (entree) -- It was alright. Took a bit to come out of the kitchen, and because of that was a little over-cooked. Our waiter did apologize, and made up for it with 2 shots of cat-daddy moonshine when he brought us the check. Wouldn't order that entree again, but had it been cooked better (and not forgotten...) it would have been delicious! The caramelized onions with the apples was an interesting yet tasty combination.\n\nAll in all, we had a great experience. Despite the couple of speed-bumps (stupid, fratty bachelor party boys and the over-cooked entree), the wait staff made up for it both times, which made me feel a lot more comfortable. I did knock off a star for the over-cooked entree, but I still recommend eating here 100%!", "date": "2013-09-27 22:56:08"}

Truly satisfying flavors and textures.\n\nWe preceded that with wood-fired oysters with chili-garlic butter; a salad of thin-sliced mushrooms, fennel, flash-fried preserved lemon, deep-fried beef jerky (!), and plenty of parsley;  coal-roasted eggplant with a kind of tomato compote with crushed herbs, almost Provencal-style; and smoked ribs with a tangy sauce topped with watermelon pickles.\n\nWe ran out of stomach space, but the rest of the 30-item menu sounds equally delicious (and looks it, as verified by the stream of platters going past us to other tables), and we particularly wanted to try the oyster-bacon sandwich.\n\nWe were off to Frenchmen St for music and drinking, so we chose just a couple of glasses from the relatively small (~50) but carefully chosen wine list, which includes everything from Prosecco to cabs, with about a dozen of them available by the glass.\n\nSimple corner room has light wood everywhere.

We didn't make reservations because we weren't sure when we would end our tour so we ended up waiting nearly 40 mins for a table. After we finally sat down, we ordered tons of food. For the appetizers we ordered the fried alligator, chargrilled oysters with chili garlic sauce, stuffed artichoke with crab, a side\nof mac and cheese, and the fried livers on toast. The appetizers were probably the best part of the meal and we were fans of all the dishes except the stuffed artichoke due to the toughness of the artichoke leaves. It was our first time eating alligator and surprisingly, it was pretty delicious but that's probably due to the way Cochon prepared the dish. For the main dishes we ordered the cochon which is similar to a fried pulled pork patty over cabbage, rabbit and dumplings and the braised pork cheeks. Personally, I liked the rabbit and dumplings best because the cochon was a little too salty for us and the braised pork cheeks were just okay.\n\nOverall, the food was good and very rich, which made it difficult to eat as much as I wanted. We were so stuffed from the appetizers that we couldn't even finish the main courses. \n\nI hope to come back to Cochon the next time I return to New Orleans!", "date": "2013-11-04 17:11:44"}

When we got the restaurant it was fairly empty and filled up within an hour. I do not like being seated on a long bench with my husband across from me. I hate this style of seating. There was a couple eating 2 feet on either side of us. As soon as I saw where they were seating us, I was completely disheartened. If i'm expected to spend $$$ for a meal, I want a table and chairs or a booth not a half booth. I actually stopped to ask to be seated elsewhere but suddenly I was under a spell or momentum of the hostess indicating I needed to slide in between to tables, that I  said nothing. Since it's a team, it's hard to know who was doing what. Our dark haired waitress gave us menus, then returned \"do you know what you want?\"  When the couples on either side of us left and a new pair was seated on either side of us, their server told them the great specials, we didn't get told about. Immediately I wanted to change my order, but no employee came our way until our food was served and let me tell you that even through that was likely only 5-10 minutes, it seemed like a cavern of time. A team service person brought out our food, followed with a new person came ask how our food was after it was mostly gone and in looking at the open restaurant I was noticing our waitress was not in the room. The busser was great at clearing away our plates and filling our water and folding my husbands' napkin when he went to the restroom.  Our waitress came back after I had soured, and no mater how wonderful the food was my husband got it in his mind this place was too hipster for him, the terrible waitress and hipster music caused him to announce he didn't care about his meal and was ready to leave. So in a week in New Orleans for Halloween, my only memory of my meal was a great craft cocktail, the apple bobber. The other $75 in food is a blur of disappointment for what should been a top dining experience for the week.", "date": "2013-11-04 20:47:29"}

Cochon is a simple, rustic wood panelled room that serves up simple and delicious classic southern cuisine. The smell of barbecue entices one to venture inside from Tchoupitoulas Street, affectionately called \"Chop Street\" in these parts.\n\nWhat's Really Good? \nChef Link's restaurant offers a number of classic Cajun southern dishes, a style of cooking and food which he has worked at professionally since the tender age of 15. The attention to detail in these slow foods and cooking really shows. A fantastic selection of bourbon and local craft beers from Abita and NOLA really pair with, and elevate Link's cuisine.\n\nAs for the menu, the fried alligator with chili garlic aioli seems like an appropriate start to any southern meal. The breading is light, the flavour of the alligator quite rich, and the aioli is a welcome accoutrement for those looking for a hint of spice. The paneed pork cheeks with roasted corn grits and tomato salad are awesomely succulent and tender; the pork cheeks pull apart with your fork to create a smoky, salty and rich dish.\n\nYou'll Wanna Know\nThough the menu changes seasonally, and frequently, there is sure to be a classic southern dish to all tastes which can be enjoyed. Classic southern cuisine can take a long time to prepare, to braise, to smoke, and Chef Donald Link's Cochon truly shows an attention to detail of mastering the art of this traditional and loved American Cuisine.", "date": "2013-11-27 17:25:06"}

Think that as a whole my Manhattans in this city (all bourbon; no one seemed to have rye on hand) are frothy and strangely more pinkish and girly tasting than I am used to.  Maybe there is a larger proportion of sweet vermouth used and they like to shake it up very vigorously, I don't know the details of making these.

Also was disappointed with fried livers, but don't particularly care for the sweet/savory thing (pepper jelly was sweet pepper jelly), so probably not the best thing for me to get.  However, the baked gulf fish was amazing.  Flaky, fresh as all get-out, and some kind of insanely good Cajun-ish seasoning on top.

The experience was horrible and I regret suggesting this place! None of us (10 people) will be back. \n\n1. We walked in to an empty restaurant (maybe 4 tables were occupied) and were told by the hostess we couldn't be seated until our full party arrived. So instead of sitting, we all stood around OUR table crowding the walkway until everyone showed up.\n\n2. We ordered 2 bean pies and 2 orders of oysters to start and only 1 bean pie was delivered (the second was delivered 15 minutes later because the waiter \"dropped the original one\"). So 10 of us had to share crumbs of the first bean pie and by the time the second came nobody wanted it. By the way the bean pie is gross. Oysters were okay.\n\n3. Every single person at the table received their entr\u00e9e except me (I was the only one to order fish). Out of respect everyone was waiting for me to get my meal, but eventually had to just go ahead and eat because it took over 10 minutes to deliver my meal (we all assume he forgot to put the order in). The waiter compted me a shot of moonshine but that still didn't make up for ruining our meal. \n\n4. Our boss asked for some horse radish for his pork and was literally told, \"there is more than enough already on the table, you can share\". I am not kidding!!!! We all had a good laugh after that because what else can you do after being spoken to like a child when you are paying for a $400 meal. \n\nMaybe my problem was primarily with the waiters we had but the whole place wreaks of poor customer service and unfriendly faces. Our entire Christmas party consisted of, \"did we get what we ordered?\" \"when will we get refills?\" \"did they deliver your meal yet?\". It was horrible and not fun at all.

Rabbit and dumpling - this taste really similar to a pot pie filling.

One of the most popular appetizers with our group was a fatback special.\n\nThe eponymous cochon was a favorite main course, although no one could finish it. It was absurdly rich.

Alligator bites - delicious\n2. Cochon- yummy but very salty and got old fast. There needs to be another flavor to break it up. \n3. Catfish dish- the person that got it said \"decent\"\n4. Bologna salad- two ppl got this and said good and a nice change to blah salads. The bologna pieces are deep fried, it's not a traditional fried piece of bologna slapped on top of a salad. \n5. Sides: Mac and cheese - delicious! \nBroccoli: great\nLima beans: very good, but cooked almost like pinto beans. \nTwice baked potato: almost up there with the alligator bites!! \n\nOverall, the food was good and the wait sucked!

The bake and serve type that come in a 12 or 24 pack for $2.00. Disappointed!\nI ordered the \"special\"  salad that had greens and strawberries and fried cheese curds. It was a smallish serving but tasted pretty good as I started chowing down. When I got to the bottom of the plate, I had to stop eating. The salt level of the salad was so high that I wondered what happened on the bottom of the plate since the top portion was so good. I turned it back in to the waiter with a comment. Was it that the cheese curds were the over salted culprit?\nI ordered the Lousiana couchon dish  of pulled pork with turnip cabbage and cracklings and some kind of sauce. The veggies were soggy and overdone. Even the turnips! The cracklings were just typical of a Mexican grocery store and not what I though a restaurant of this caliber would serve. I thought that they would be the real deal: Real skin, real pork. The pork was a nice portion, tender but so over salted that I felt like cringing and gritting my teeth. The meat was good enough to stand on its own, why were they over salting the food? Not something to serve people with high blood pressure. Over salting to preserve the freshness of the pork?\nLuckily, the staff was attentive enough to call the manager and tell him of my concerns. Will Davis, the manager came to discuss the food with me. He was patient listening to my issues. I ordered one more dish to fill the corners of my empty salt filled tummy, I ordered a shrimp and mirliton dressing side order. It was different, spicy and stuffing like. I could not find but one bay shrimp in there. I thought that since shrimp was mentioned in the title that it would be the main ingredient. Maybe the dish was made of  shrimp that was ground up and seasoned? Didn't quite get that description. Again a dish that  disappointed. It was spicy but at least not over salted.\nI left the restaurant wanting to cry. I felt like I just left the salt lick at the stockyards.

We were lucky to get an early evening reservation during our vacation and looked forward to it for weeks.  The entire day was planned around this meal. The food was good, great even, but so much of a meal like this is about the ambiance and the overall experience.  Unfortunately that aspect of it killed the entire night for me and my perception of this restaurant.  The restaurant was near empty when we got there however even with our reservation the hostess said she had to \"try\" to find us a table and made us wait 15 minutes without another word spoken.  Then she proceeded to seat us in such a way I felt like I was being dragged off to a sentencing.  Now, I don't mind waiting, I know that she could be juggling more than I might be able to see, it was the arrogance and attitude that got me.  No matter, a hostess on a power trip was not going to spoil this for me.  But, the waiter was no different.  We learned as we were leaving that there were specials to be had that night, it would have been nice to be told what they were.  We could hardly get a drink order taken or waters filled.  I asked a question about a menu item but was asked to wait mid sentence.  By this point I was over it.  I had good money to spend on the evening but obviously it wasn't any good at this establishment.  We had a small meal and left.  The only thing that kept this from being a total waste was getting to see a jazz wedding go by while at the dive bar across the street prior to our reservation.

I really really really really wanted to try the bacon-y Elvis king cake before Mardi Gras was over, and looked on the website to see if it was available in small portions or by the slice. As it turns out, the website said that you can buy Elvis King Cake by the slice for $3.50.\n\n( See: http://www.cochonbutcher.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Butcher-Menu-SUN-FEB-2014-WEB.pdf )\n\nI went there today and accidentally went to the nicer dining side of the restaurant asking if I can get a elvis king cake slice to go (specifically that item and \"by the slice\" were details included in my question) I was directed to the deli section of the store where I waited in a long line. Right when it was my turn to get to the register for this simple order, the cashier began taking a multi-person order from a man standing next to the long line of people and ignored me, the one standing in front of the cash register.  After completing his order, she finally got to me only to tell me that they do not serve this Elvis king cake by the slice and it has to pre-ordered and can only be ordered as a whole cake. Since the website AND the hostess of the restaurant did not inform me otherwise, I'm a little disappointed, as well as the cashier letting someone cut in line. Not a fan of this place right now.\n\nLooks like I'll be coming up with my own bacon king cake this Mardi Gras.... :(", "date": "2014-02-26 22:55:35"}

DAMN. GOOD.\n\nWords cannot describe how amazing the food is at Cochon. Pair that with excellent service and you have a WINNER! I came all the way from Houston, TX to give this restaurant a run for my money and it was worth every mile driven and every dollar spent. \n\nCochon does not seem like your typical cajun/creole restaurant that you would expect to typically find in New Orleans. It has a modern/contemporary feel with a cool hipster flare to it. What I love most about this restaurant is that it is in no way pretentious but you get the same quality food and service as you would in a five star restaurant without the ridiculous price tag. We had two servers who were on point and knew exactly what they were doing. When a server can pay attention to the little things like filling your water before it reaches half full or wiping away any crumbs on the table, you're an A+ in my book.\n\nThe food of course is incredible! Do yourself a favor and order these dishes. I promise you that you will not regret ordering a single dish and your stomach will be oh-so happy.\n\n[+] Wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter. The sauce on these oysters are literally like liquid crack it is that amazing. Save the complementary bread they give you and use that to mop up every last drop of this liquid gold.\n\n[+] Fried alligator with chili garlic mayonnaise. At first I was skeptical but now I'm a firm believer. Don't be fooled when you read the word mayonnaise because it does not taste like it at all. Some say the texture can be a little chewy. To me, it has similar texture to that of chicken fried steak. Delicious, to say the least.\n\n[+] Paneed pork cheeks with cauliflower puree & beet relish. The pork cheeks were perfectly charred and crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. I was sad that this was not listed as an entree because I would have definitely devoured the entire plate.\n\n[+] Rabbit and dumplings. Comfort food at its finest. The rabbit was so tender it was practically melting in my mouth. The dumplings were soft and dense- a perfect combination for the rich filling. \n\nCochon is definitely a restaurant worth trying.

I ordered a ribs app that was inedibly salty.

The waiter wasn't the fastest and the food was slow to come out, but when it did, I wanted to eat here every night. \n\nWe started with alligator bites, which were the best thing we ordered. They were in a mild hot sauce, it reminded us of boneless chicken wings, but so much better. The sauce was addicting. For dinner I ordered the Rabbit stew. It came in an individual cast iron skillet filled with plenty of rabbit and homemade sage rolls on top. The vegetables were cooked perfect, and not mushy. My husband got the beef and gravy dish. The potatoes were cold, which I think surprised him, but he said the flavor was really good. \n\nWe saw the parade coming up the street, as they were at the end of the route.

The setting is informal, with a live and friendly atmosphere.\n\nThe menu is a mix of small plates, soups, salads and appetizers, along with an entr\u00e9e section.\n\nThe dinner rolls are some of the best I've ever had.  Served hot and with a cottony soft texture and glazed with butter, these are a great way to start any meal.  One could probably make a meal of just bread and a couple of appetizers, but why deny yourself exploring the menu full of great dishes.\n\nThe boudin balls, are fried to a nice golden brown, super crunchy on the outside, and moist in the middle.  The boudin balls are made with rice and boudin, served with pickled peppers that are full of an acidic punch, and a nicely spiced mustard.\n\nThe oyster and bacon sandwich is a take on the classic BLT, escalated with a New Orleans twist of fried oysters.  Topped with a zesty remoulade and a side of creamy coleslaw to cut through the richness of the bacon and fried oysters, this is a definite winner.\n\nThe smoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad is a must try dish.  Five thick slices of tender and fatty brisket are served with a side of potato salad with a zing from the horseradish.  The brisket is on the verge of falling apart and has a wonderful smoky taste.  Served in a rich au jus, the potato salad helps to cut through the fattiness of the brisket with a brightness brought on by the horseradish.  There may be a hint of mustard in the potato salad as well.\n\nThe macaroni and cheese casserole will be a big hit for cheese lovers.  A generous portion with a nice golden crust is served in a cast iron casserole dish.  The cheese may be a little overpowering for those used to boxed Mac & Cheese. The secret binder to this dish?  Mashed potatoes.  Brilliant!\n\nThe bread pudding may not be a thing of beauty to look at, but is wonderful for those who like \"soggy\" bread pudding, and a heavy handed bourbon sauce.  The bread pudding has a great custard and reminds me of super soggy French toast baked with cr\u00e8me brulee.\n\nThe pineapple upside down cake is deconstructed with a corn meal cake with several strips of pineapple baked into the cake.  There is a salted caramel sauce with a lime coconut sorbet.  This is a light and refreshing dessert, and a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nChef Donald Link was nominated for Outstanding Chef 2012 by the James Beard Foundation, for his other restaurant Herbsaint.\n\nThe price point at Cochon is a steal for the quality of food, execution and taste.  The dishes are primarily simple, comfort foods but executed with great precision and using great local ingredients.\n\nSee blog for pics.", "date": "2014-04-28 01:44:45"}

For those that don't know about boudin, it's really just housemade sausage which is rolled into a ball and fried, instead of being put in the casing.

And those were just appetizers...\n\nFor our entrees, we got the ham hock and their signature dish the cochon.  Man, these two dishes were phenomenal.

We had the pork belly, pork cheeks with grits, smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle, louisiana cochon with cracklins, and then rabbit & dumplings (to represent non-pork options).

I had great expectations, and yes, some of them were met, but some were most definitely not.  This New American style restaurant specializes in pork, as their name suggests.\n\nFor the most part, their flavors are innovative and remind me quite a bit of restaurants in Berkeley and their philosophy on food.  Most of their dishes are best had tapas style, which is another reason why I initially fell in love with this spot.  Growing up in Taiwan, sharing many dishes of food is just too natural to me!  My favorite was their fried alligator with chili garlic mayo (10), which was a battered alligator with a delicious and warm mayo served with parsley.  I must say though, the second time I ordered this dish, I got mostly batter, and the mayo didn't taste the same.  The braised pork cheeks (11) erred on the salty side, and wasn't spectacular.  The pork and black eyed pea gumbo (7) was quite delicious, especially with the kale, but again, was a bit salty.\n\nMy first experience was not bad, but the second time I visited, my whole table had a bit of the stomach flu (4 for 4).  The service was great the first and terrible the second, and so I wonder at the inconsistency.  My biggest pet peeve of a restaurant is inconsistency, and Cochon was exactly that.", "date": "2014-05-10 03:48:57"}

And of course, save room for the Bread Pudding but I wouldn't share a bite...\n\nMy two friends and I split the ribs and the chicken livers as apps. The ribs/sauce probably were the best ribs I've ever eaten. The sauce was incredibly flavorful as was the watermelon pickle topping. Dang!!! Falling off the bonk pork greatness. So we ordered another round of ribs. The livers were ok. Nice jalapeno jelly glaze. \n\nI ordered the cochon for my entree: mega-juicy and tender with a nice balance between the cabbage, turnips and a pork cracklin. TIP: ask for a side of their BBQ sauce for dipping the pork and dinner rolls. \n\nThe mac and cheese app was nice and gooey. Didn't taste as good as Cochon Butcher's mac and cheese that we had had earlier in the day. Still freaking good.\n\nI also tried and loved the small offerings of the Ham Hock and the Catfish courtbullion that my buds ordered. Both were outstanding; almost as good as my cochon.

Maybe New Orleanians are not as sensitive to salt but you could not taste any of the ingrediants - there were clearly carrots, celery and pieces of rabbit but they all were consumed by the salty viscous 'stew'...\n\nLouisiana Cochon - this was good. Tasty au jus poured over stewed pork topped with cracklins surrounded by pickled turnips. The stewed pork was a bit dry but the turnips and cracklins (which melted in your mouth) made up for it.\n\nThe service was poor - we saw our waiter once, he failed to give us the specials and told us there was no bread left all the while the table next to us just got bread from a different waiter. We finally got our bread which obviously was the star of the show.", "date": "2014-05-29 16:30:11"}

The environment is clean, modern, and inviting. The staffs are very friendly. Most importantly, the foods are outrageously good. I'm a food lover and a good cook myself. My first exposure to Cajun food was through a cooking book written by chef Paul so naturally the K-Paul's Restaurant was on top of my must-go places during my stay. The day before I finally went there but left feeling unimpressed. That experience filled me with certain doubts when I went to this restaurant this afternoon. Boy was I surprised! The wood fired oyster was so good I had to order one more plate. It is served on a bed of rock salts and the oysters are juicy and full of flavor. I normally prefer fresh raw oysters with little  spice added, but now I'm a convert. I will choose these cooked oysters over any raw ones without blinking. The fried alligator is very good too. The breading does not override all the flavor and preserves the unique texture of the meat quite well. Eat each piece with the fresh mint leave provided and you will enjoy a quite complex taste unlike typical fried stuff. The fisherman style fish is a masterpiece as well!\n\nAll in all, this is one of the few truly memorable dining experiences I've had in my life. It has been a few hours and I'm still in food coma.

Personally I am not a fan of banqet seating where the person next to me could eat off my plate. There are maybe 4 booths but none were available.\n\nApps/ Small Plates = Fried chicken livers & Boudin balls\nYou get 3 of each for I think it was $9 for each plate. They were good. Not like wow I want more though. We are from this area so we have eaten both many times. So maybe we are biased on those items.\n\nEntrees = I got the gulf fish of the day which was redfish. My wife got the fried chicken that came with a watermelon & heirloom tomato salad.\nSigh..well...I love fish & when the waiter said they leave the skin on & make it crispy, I thought oh good because I like that. Well lets just say he failed to mention THEY LEAVE THE FRICKN SCALES ON!! Needless to say after a bite with a mouthful of scales, I was SO done. It made me sick to my stomach. The waiter was apologetic, saying thats how they cook it. I said Yea well we live down here too & people around here eat crispy skin when its on the fish but I didnt expect the fish to not be cleaned & descaled! He was kind of cavalier about it like Not my fault but continued to apologize. In the end, they took it off our bill which was great on their part. \nMy wife said the chicken was fine. The BEST PART of the whole meal was the sweet yellow watermelon & heirloom cherry tomato salad. She added a small amount of the white vinegar on the table (nice touch by the way) that had a few peppers floating in it & a dash of salt and OMG , we both said we could have eaten a bowl of just that!\n\nEverything is a la carte. My $28 fish only came with a pile of pickled onions. We did get the mac & cheese. I always try mac & cheeae when its on a menu. Not a fan of this one.\n\nWe didnt bother getting dessert. My wife wanted peach cobbler but the waiter said the chef took it off the menu for that night because \" he didnt like how it was looking\". So I guess of he thought it wasnt good for whatever reason, it was best he didnt serve it.\n\nInstead we grabbed the heavenly & undeniably amazing cheesecake from Ruth's Chris steakhouse downstairs at our hotel.\n\nSo Id say it was an experience....one I dont care to repeat\n\nThe feeling of chewing & then realizing I had a mouthful of fish scales is permanently engrained in my mind.", "date": "2014-06-19 03:59:23"}

I wish the dumplings were a little more doughy but they were still great.  I would have never thought to order this there but everyone including the waiter suggested it.  A must to try.\n\nShrimp and eggplant - my God I have never wanted to eat so much eggplant in my life.  It was spicy with a very slight sweetness to it.  Oh I loved it.\n\nCheek - I have had cheek before where it just melted in my mouth.  This was a little dry for me.  I think it was overcooked but I didn't even enjoy the flavor.  Not sure where they were going with this.  \n\nMy advice, try the restaurant, get the rabbit and the casserole.  Adventure with a few other menu items but not the cheek.\n\nWe didn't have a wait because we had reservations.

The hip wait staff are  friendly, accommodating and are definitely proud of their restaurant.  Cochon has a James Beard award which  I'm sure doesn't hurt.  I knew this was going to be a feast so instead of taking the rental car I walked with friends about a mile to Cochon. \n\nNow the cuisine.   What did I think?  Sleek simple flavors, genuine which is  a  stark contrast to bold Orleans flavors.  I am very impressed that there are options other than Emeril's dynasty of restaurants, the Brennan dynasty of restaurants, Arnaud's, Galatoire's,  Antoine's  and K-Pauls to savor flavors of the new , \"Southern\" New Orleans.  Think earthy, savory, spicy yet restrained, distinct and genuine.  \n\nFor starters, I had the ribs appetizer because honestly, if the totem for this restaurant is a pig, you bet your mint julep ima get me some porc.  I had a glass of red Zin with this slightly spicy dish, 3 ribs to an order, enough for 2, 2 going to the pork glutton.  I was tempted to sin but  I shared this with two others.  It was super scrummy, different, with surprising yet awakening flavors of fennel seed  BBQ spices, vinegar.   The spiced melon rind added savory contrast to the vinegar that gave me a lightbulb moment --- why aren't additions like this a standard in our culinary lexicon?    The ribs were served at room temperature  which  threw me off.   I expected something hot off the smoker , yet I quickly realized that by serving them at room temp,  all the flavors and condiments are showcased.    I tasted a barbecued rib that was so different so clean and spicily yummy from any BBQ i've had.  I was in heaven.\n\nThen the crawfish gumbo.  Gumbo, how do I love thee?   I can have gumbo breakfast lunch and dinner.   It was definitely a familiar gumbo but was outstanding in the sense that  I could taste the crawfish tamale in the sauce.... the umami richness was there yet the aftertaste was seafood and green Earth in a bowl, just to die for.    If you're a gumbo fan, this can easily be a 2 bowl order but you wanna move on to the next course.   \n\nFinally, the Main:   Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage, pickled peaches & cracklins.  This dish to me was the bomb of bombs.  If you ever craved a pork on porc stewed, fried, crispy, earthy, cooked low and slow, and sultry all on one plate, this was IT.   The almost provincial presentation of the dish reminded me of eating in a small restaurant in the country.  The glass of Pinot I ordered went super delish with this plate.   My brain immediately thought meat lasagne sans noodles, layers of slow cooked meat, with braised vegetables, simple yet profound.  The very light sauce reminded me that this dish was deceptively cooked for hours to create a complexity of tastes behind simple  techniques.  Was a bit stunned.  To add to the flavor bombs of  this experience, the dish is topped with a crackling, the crowning glory to the plate that made the most obscene statement to me-- this is a celebration of beautiful PORK from head to tail.  Dipped the crackling in banana peppers in vinegar (served table side).....  Awed, started to laugh, SMH.\n\nI  capped my meal with a shaved Brussels sprouts salad with lemon vinaigrette and Parmesan shavings.   Never had raw brussel sprouts.  The toothy greens with a proper French lemon dressing and a minimal addition of sharp cheese was the lightest of salads I've had in a very very long time.    Awed, SMH.  Dining friends agreed, ditto.  \n\nToo full and didn't  venture on to dessert but will next time.   \n\nI've always admired the cuisines of New Orleans for nowhere in this great US of A  is a region steeped in classic French, Creole, Cajun cooking techniques and traditions.   The culinary ecosystem is changing in New Orleans.   Cochon pioneers  the  split from Creole/Cajun/French traditions and reminds us that the changing world of eating in New Orleans is leaning toward simple yet developed, still steeped in multi-cultural gastronomy traditions without forgetting the generational practices of Southern cooking.... LOVE IT.   I do.  \n\nComing back. \n\n\nVisits: 1", "date": "2014-06-26 05:13:21"}

My wife and I went here twice....in a row, it was the good!\n  The first night we were able to sit at \"The Chef's Counter\" which is an area that overlooks the wood burning oven, and a very hectic kitchen.  \n\nThe appetizers that I had (between both nights) were the Fried Alligator, and the oven-roasted oysters.  First the gator...YUM!  It was seasoned just right, and the chili-garlic mayonnaise that was drizzled lightly over the top really brought this dish together.  \nNow for the oysters---heaven.  The compound butter that is put on these oysters is so delicious.  If you think you do not like Oysters (especially if they came from the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean), you need to try gulf oysters.  They are much more mellow, and not as briny as their cousins from the Atlantic.  An order is typically served with 6-8 oysters (depending on size), and this is so worth it!\n\nMy wife had the Heirloom Tomato Salad with toasted bread and farmer's cheese.  DO NOT pass by this small, yet scrumptious salad.  It starts out with a big piece of white bread (toasted perfectly), on top of that Cochon spreads a very simple pesto (without pinenuts!), and then spreads farmers cheese on top of that.  It is quickly fired in the oven, and then topped with fresh heirloom tomatoes that are dressed simply in olive oil.  My mouth still waters thinking about this dish, and it is only a piece of bread with tomatoes on it!!!!\n\nFor the entree, both nights, I had the Rabbit and Dumplings.  Words cannot describe how delicious this dish is.  It is like a chicken pot pie with tender pieces of rabbit served in a cast iron skillet, and topped with homemade biscuits.  I am well aware that New Orleans is hot and muggy, especially in the summer time, but this dish instantaneously brought me back to a snowy New England day.  I also did enjoy a side of their Mac and Cheese Casserole, and that was pretty good as well.  \n\nMy wife had the smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle.  There was a spice that she was not too fond of, but since I married her, I was able to eat some of this dish.  While not my favorite, it was really delicious, and the watermelon pickle complimented this dish very nicely. \n\nI cannot wait to return back to New Orleans, and rest assured, this will be our first stop for dinner.", "date": "2014-06-28 20:45:45"}

The cochon plate was good but not superb. They just serve you the meat but it would've been nice if the would've come with a side like fries, a salad or bunny bread atleast. I felt ripped off. Definitely a tourist trap. \nOn a positive note, the place looked great. Very hip in a trendy part of town. Nicely designed with a great ambiance.

There are not many types of foods that I do not enjoy and usually I try to preserve this by using moderation. I don't frequent on particular type of restaurant to others for the type of food being served. I always enjoy restaurants that pay particular attention to quality of the food without distracting us with pretentious environments. Luckily, Cochon compliments my taste in food with my preferred atmosphere.\n \nConchon isn't really hard to find in comparison to a few other nice New Orleans dining options. Remember to look up when looking for the place; the sign is a little subdued (which fits the restaurant style). If you are anywhere near the tourist-populated areas this shouldn't be hard to find. I grabbed a really late lunch around 4 o'clock on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. I stayed for a couple of hours and noticed that there was a wait when we left just before 7PM. I would imagine calling ahead is probably a good idea on busy nights. There is a bar available and tables outside; I would imagine waiting shouldn't be too painful with a drink.\n\nThe atmosphere is very casual but gives you the impression that it is intentional and not because they didn't have the option to make it less casual. Feel comfortable wearing a T-shirt and something to cover your feet. The atmosphere feels like it encourages you to have a conversation with the person you came with or met there. I think the atmosphere extended our conversation longer that it normally would have been. Expect a trendy talkative environment. I don't have kids but you may be able to get away with it on the weekends if you decided to. (Not sure what kid menu options would be available). \n\nThe menu selection is appropriate; it a great option for foodies and people who just want something safe to eat. I went with a couple small plate and boucherie options as opposed to ordering entrees. I don't live in New Orleans so really wasn't excited about only trying one item. I ordered the woodfired oysters, chili glazed shrimp, fried boudin, smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle, and a side of the smothered greens. I had an Abita S.O.S. and my fianc\u00e9 had a MollyWop (hilarious name). Everything we had was excellent. I prefer my small plates to come out as each one is prepared because I like it hot. The oysters were still warmed but I want them as soon as they are finished. Please note that the chili glazed shrimp comes with the heads; their actually very good when forked with the body and a lemon circle. Don't forget to try one of the sides, some places don't pay as much attention to the quality of their sides as entrees. Conchon is not one of them, the side of smothered greens was exceptional.\n\nService at this place was pretty good. I prefer servers that are accommodating and not intrusive; this place definitely does a great job of walking that line. The price as expected was around $70 for two people. On average that would be about $35 each. \n\nGreat experience and option if you are looking for New Orleans but open to another take on traditional items. Foodies and hungry people should enjoy this place. I will go back next time I am there.", "date": "2014-07-08 17:01:54"}

I feel you get very little for the high price. \n\nAlso, they claim to be Cajun style food well no Cajun style I feel.\n\nThe bathroom was really dirty and waste basket full of paper towels and falling on the floor.\n\nThe manager came to the table and mentioned that it is really hard to find Cajun food in New Orleans well yeah not at COCHON.

I actually enjoyed it. It doesn't have a bitter after taste and the smoked flavor and smell is not strong at all.  It's the right balance.  Surprisingly, it was my favorite out of everything.\nCochon ($28) - it's like eating pork with a crapload of salt.  Seriously, I don't know if it's only that evening, but the chef was heavy handed on the salt. :/  Sheesh.  It was NOT worth the $28 even if you are a pork lover...and I AM a pork eater.  You aint' missing much. Save your money for the smaller plates.  \nPork cheeks - let's just say this...I remember it being sweet and unimpressive. Enough said.  \nGumbo - it was alright. Had better 'nuff said.\nFried livers - TOO MUCH batter. I mean it was like eating batter with a hint of liver. LOL...yeah no.\n\nSo folks, let's just say this. Their main entrees like like around $20 and up.  We sat next to a group of adults and we looked over and they did NOT even finish their food.  I mean, I don't care if people get full or they don't want to gain weight or whatever, but if you have really good food in front of you and you love food, you WILL finish 99% of your food.

Its very rare that I see more than a couple drinks on a cocktail list that look appealing to me. Their mixologist, Hannah, is a genius. Plus the fact they make their own marachino cherries, bitters, purees, etc doesnt hurt either. The wait is usually long ( around an hour) so we ens up finding a seat at the bar hence the reason I know the bartenders name by heart;)  It is pricey but it is quality and also a cuisine you can find anywhere else in the city.

My experience was more deserving of 3.5 stars, but there isn't that option, and it definitely was not a 4 star experience.  \n\nThe service was solid and helpful, offering suggestions and giving opinions upon the popular items and personal favorites.  The host was wonderful and quite welcoming, and also helpful when I was looking at the liquor selection at the bar.  The restaurant wasn't too busy during our time of visit, but we appreciated the time the server spent with us.  The problems were simply with attention and table maintenance, as we definitely could have used new sharing plates more often, and empty plates spent a good amount of time on the table.  The pace of the meal also left a bit to be desired.  The three of us decided to share all of the food so that we could taste more of the menu, but the pacing was non-existent.  Everything pretty much hit the table at once, instead of it being brought out at possibly two or three dishes at a time to share, we had five plates hit the table at once during the first delivery, then another two following very shortly after.  Thankfully, the server/s noticed that food covered the whole table and slowed down the next couple plates.  Pretty big oversight in my opinion, and definitely something that should be addressed, considering it is the food that suffers from just sitting on the table.  \n\nOn to some of the food!\n\nWood Fired Oysters - Delicious chili garlic butter sauce, but over half the oysters had shriveled inside the shell from being overcooked.  It was almost comical how small they looked inside the shell.  Definitely not a plate that should have left the kitchen.  \n\nMushroom Salad - I really liked this dish.  The bright acidity, the great contrast in textures, and that beautiful earthiness of the mushrooms... such a nice combination.  The beef jerky is such an interesting component of the dish.  Some bits are slightly crunchy, while others have that great chewiness jerky is known for, providing this great little dance with the texture of the mushrooms. It's kind of a juggling of the umami flavors that the jerky and mushroom imparts.  The lemon vinaigrette imparts a great finish to those lingering flavors and the dish works so well.  The salad seems so simple, but just has layers of flavor.\n\nGulf Shrimp with Artichokes and Mushrooms - Pretty darn tasty with the earthiness that the roasted artichokes and mushrooms added to the dish.  Nice croutons soaked up a bit of the sauce and provided some good texture to each bite.  My only criticism would be with the discrepancy in size of the shrimp, surely an issue with the supplier, but a chef definitely needs to notice when one of the three shrimp is almost half the size of the others.  Just something really simple and easily fixed, but overlooked in this kitchen.  \n\nFried Livers with Pepper Jelly and Toast - so disappointing.  The livers were fried to a literal crisp, offering very little flavor and just really providing overly crunchy texture.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the pieces just turned out to be fried batter.  The pepper jelly was tasty, but there was far too much of it, maybe the chef was trying to save the terrible toast that was almost cracker crunchy with none of that wonderfully tender middle you find in well executed toast.  Why not just use crackers if you want it to be that crisp?  Probably just another mistake in quality control by the chef, but that seems to be a running theme for this dining experience. \n\nSmoked Pork Ribs - came slathered with sauce.  Definitely didn't compensate for the overly dry ribs.  Watermelon pickles were tasty and the smoke was noticeable on the ribs, but goodness... this dish really tipped the scale and was quite a disappointment.\n\nPeach Cobbler - ended up being the only dessert we had, which was probably a mistake.  The peaches were nicely incorporated, with that nice brightness that you find with delicious peaches that haven't been canned and packed in syrup.  The wonderful crust was tasty, adding great texture without being overwhelmingly sweet, holding up well with the ice cream on top.  The cinnamon ice cream was just over the top.  Deliciously creamy with the definite taste of cinnamon without being too sweet.  Such a simple and great dessert.\n\nWe definitely could have done without some of the other dishes in order to get more of the desserts.\n\nThe other dishes we had were solid, but nothing stood out about them.  Kind of a good thing, because what stood out most about the meal is the errors found in half the dishes we received.  Just not enough attention to detail, and sub par quality and integrity of the dishes.  I'm definitely coming back to try more of the menu, but I couldn't help but be disappointed in how this should have been our best dining experience in New Orleans spoiled by all kinds of oversight.", "date": "2014-08-22 14:48:20"}

I think the meat pie was my dad's favorite.\n\nFried Livers with Pepper Jelly & Toast - I ordered these for the table because Southern Living suggested this dish when it highlighted Cochon in its 100 Best Southern Restaurants. I enjoyed the livers a lot, but, thought the meat pie was the better of the two small plates we ordered. The pepper jelly had a nice kick to it and the toast elevated the dish\n\nSmoked Pork Ribs with Watermelon Pickle - The Pork ribs were so tender; they practically melted in my mouth; the watermelon pickle I would have never thought to add to a slab of ribs and, lo and behold, it was dynamite!\n\nBraised Pork Cheeks with Fried Field Pea & Sorghum Salad & Grilled Eggplant - I thought this dish was very complex and wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it. I'm so glad we ordered it, because all the elements really worked exceptionally well together. The fried field pea added a nice crunch to the dish, while the eggplant gave it this nice smoky flavor.\n\nSmothered Greens - Oh My Goodness Gracious!

How i remembered this recommendation still baffles me.  Anyway, I had the catfish courtbouillon and my friend had the pork cheeks. I was really hopeful and excited about what was to come but then the food came.  \n\nNow I will say the presentation is amazing but the taste was a little meh.  The pork cheeks were tender and flavorful but then the BEPs on top were either fried or dried. Either way I don't think crispy BEPs are appetizing and I must say the catfish courtbouillon needed to have a roux base tomato sauce or some tomato paste added because it was so runny. Thicker sauce please!!!  I couldn't believe the catfish nuggets were fried because  after a while the fish becomes soggy sitting in the runny sauce.  Does that mean I was suppose to eat my food quickly? Don't you hate when your cereal gets soggy?  I've never had fried fish in my court bouillon, ever!  \n\nWe finished off our meal with upside down pineapple cake. Again it was meh but restaurant quality for sure. I might have given 4 stars if they had bread pudding with bourbon sauce on the menu. \n\nDepending on your appetite you might have to order a few dishes but be careful of the prices.

We asked how long the list was and if we would be able to get a table if we came right away. The hostess who answered said, \"There are only seven people on the list right now,\" so we told her we would be coming down in 10 or 15 minutes. \"Great, see you then,\" she said.\n\nSo, we rushed down there by car, and when we arrived ten minutes later around 8:55 and asked the hostess to please put our name on the list, she told us they could no longer seat any more walk-ins and we would have to try our luck sitting at the bar, which was completely full. We explained that we just called 10 minutes ago and someone (apparently this same hostess) encouraged us to come in. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"There's just nothing I can do at this point. We can't seat anyone else.\"\n\nMy problem is definitely not that they don't seat walk-ins after a certain time, as that's totally understandable for a busy restaurant. My problem is that the hostess should have communicated to us over the phone that there would be a risk of this happening if we drove there. Instead, she never mentioned there would be a possibility of them filling up and encouraged us to come down.

That's not what I'm saying.)\n\nI faintly remember getting into a disagreement right before our awesome waitress, Andrea, brought out bread to start. In that moment, our squabble became irrelevant. All that mattered now was how I would go about devouring these hot, sinful, buttered rolls. Between chews, I managed to order the wood-fired oysters, fried alligator, and braised pork cheeks to start.  The fried alligator reminded me too much of General Tso's chicken. Not because I'm Asian, but because they use a similar technique by frying the battered meat, then tossing it in sauce. This did not blow my mind, so skip the gator. The wood-fired oysters, on the other hand, made my eyes roll back so far I could see my backside. Alternating between eating the perfectly roasted oysters, taking the chili garlic butter straight to the head, and sopping up any remainder with that buttery roll - this was my 2nd favorite dish.The braised pork cheeks were no joke either. The cheek gently melted in my mouth, as good pork cheek should, and the fried field peas offered a great contrast in texture. I was embarrassed that during our game of \"Guess That Food\" I identified them as corn nuts.\n\nAfter demolishing 3 starters, it was only right that I split the Louisiana cochon entree and a side of macaroni & cheese with my boyfriend. For the Louisiana cochon, they somehow form this stack/patty out of pulled pork shoulder, then pan sear it. I thought it was a bit dry and bland at first, until experiencing the whole ensemble together: stewed turnips cabbage, some kind of jus, and the cracklins. Holy hell, it was like a symphony conducted by Porky Pig himself. The Filipino in me couldn't help but douse my cracklins in the vinegar offered at the table. Try it, and thank me later. But that macaroni & cheese... it brought tears to my eyes. I immediately wanted to extend my trip in NOLA, and expand my waistline. The cheese is so potent and up-front. The sauce is a creamy molten decadence that can evoke feelings of love. They must have used some N'awlins black magic to make mac & cheese this perfect. This cheese masterpiece was the highlight of my whole trip to Louisiana.\n\nThey would like you to believe that they're called Cochon because of their expertise with pig... but really, it is because you will resemble a pig by the end of your meal. This is just fine by me. My only regrets are not saving any room to dine next door at Cochon Butcher, and not ordering two sides of mac. Expand your doorway Cochon, because as soon as the tourettes-like oinking subsides, I am trotting back to New Orleans just for you.", "date": "2014-10-02 20:58:33"}

I still chose a seat at the bar as I was waiting for my friend, but they have full service and Hanna and Miles are quite entertaining. I hope they liked us as much as we liked them.\n\nI saw a few plates of the oysters come out, and knew they were the first thing I was ordering. The NOLA style seems to be wood-fired. These were outrageous; beautifully cleaned shells with large large large oysters grilled and covered in a balanced chili sauce. I am sure the butter helped temper the heat from the chilis, but they had some kick. Full disclosure, I did sop up every last bit of that sauce with their warmed french bread.\n\nNext, we tried the boudin - which is a New Orleans style pork and rice sausage. Cochon removes the casings, rolls it in a little ball and deep-fried it. Then, they serve it with spicy brown mustard and pickled peppers. I loved these; if you are nervous about boudin - try it here first.\n\nI was intrigued by the ribs because - well this place is called PIG. And, because of the pickled watermelon rinds. I liked these. The bbq sauce was a little thicker and sweeter than I was expecting, but the pickled melon helped cut it. These were fine. Well, more than fine since we quickly devoured them. I probably wouldn't order them again. It wasn't my favorite dish of the night; that award goes easily to the oysters.\n\nI wasn't feeling many of the desserts - but we couldn't pass up the house made ice cream of the day - sour cream and brownie. The sour cream ice cream was incredibly creamy and had natural tartness that complemented the rich dark chocolate brownie chunks; almost an adult version of cookies and cream. Now for real, look at that adorable pig cookie. It was a thin crisp cookie smothered with cinnamon and sugar. I loved this cookie - it easily broke apart, but it wasn't super crumbly. It reminded me of a ginger snap or graham cracker consistency.\n\nThere are a ton of places in this amazing city to try - and we didn't get to many of the celebrity chef ones - but I'll definitely go back here on my next trip.", "date": "2014-10-29 01:07:32"}

The mac and cheese and gooey and rich and a hefty portion - could easily serve as an entree. If you're planning to have it as a side, I hope you bring friends to share or are prepared to go into a heavy food coma. My friend's catfish courtbouillon was complex and flavorful. If you're feeling not pork, or something lighter, I'd definitely recommend that. \n\nIn addition to some interesting cocktail options, they have a vast assortment of sodas including Cheerwine!\n\nService was fast and friendly.", "date": "2014-11-19 17:02:42"}

I wanted something very different,  but very tasty and classy. I came to Yelp and saw Cochon was so positively rated, so I decided to give it a shot.\nWow - thank you for not letting me down, Yelp! Actually,  it's the opposite of letting me down....this place is my favorite restaurant I went to in New Orleans! I was lucky enough to go here for lunch and dinner on separate days.\n\nFor my dinner conmigo (I.e., party of 1), I came right after I got settled into the hotel to a bustling Friday evening.  I had a 9:30 reservation, but 9:50 rolled around and I was still tableless. The friendly, bearded manager was very attentive and offered me my beer of choice on the house (I ordered the clown shoes ipa....amazing!). For an appetizer, I ordered the fried livers small plate.  If you order this to share, order 2....because it is beyond delicious!  This plate is a perfect balance....a great fry on top of stiff toast and the perfect pepper jelly (for sweet and spice) and mint leaves. It was out of this world.\n\nI had the highly rated rabbit and dumplings. I will admit that it was good but did not give me the \"wow!\" Unique factor I was looking for. Delicious,  but tasted ordinary to me.\n\nFor my lunch meeting, we ended up getting a better spread of what the menu had to offer. We ordered the fire grilled oysters to share, and it was the best oyster I ever had. It had the dreamiest, best smoky flavor you could imagine (great freshly charred aroma added to the experience). I had the pork loin sandwich special on a fresh brioce bun and it was delectable (I hate that word but I can't keep saying delicious over and over :) ). No one at the table had complaints....I do wish I ordered a side of the mac and cheese. My colleagues said it was amazing tasting.... another raved about the chili, and yet another loved her pork cheeks.\n\nAll in all, there is a reason why this place is 5 stars. It is amazing and out of this world.  Sure, it's usually overcrowded and you'll wait for a table even if you have a reservation,  but the food is undoubtedly worth it.", "date": "2014-11-29 15:40:00"}

Sounds like a either a Nazi chef or a lazy server.\n \nThe oysters had a nice sauce on them. The shrimp and eggplant gratin was tasty, but unappetizing, too dark on top. The cortbouillon was tasty but a little too spicy. The mac & cheese did not taste homemade and was bland. \n\nWe waited about 30 minutes between appetizers/small plates and entrees.

It's the New Orleans proxy of the \"it\" restaurant in your city that you've come to know so well. It's trendy (everyone wants to eat there). Yet casual (jeans and a t-shirt, a-ok). The ambiance is always bustling. Reservations, if any exist, are hard to come by. Have you dined here before? No? Let me walk you through the menu. There's shared small plates involved. A couple entree options the size of your bicep. Plus craft beer, for sure a full craft menu. Though there's a $2 can of PBR, or High Life, or something of that ilk. Described as something like \"American Lager.\" \n\nThe common complaints? Service staff is a little pretentious. They know where they work is the bomb. That's okay. Treat the place with respect, and you'll win them over. The portions are too small. And/or the plates are too expensive. That's okay. Make food good. Use first-rate ingredients. If you don't like it, go to Krystal Burger. The food sucks. Can't help you there. I award your taste buds no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\nSo, Cochon. Scroll through my photo documentation and drool at your heart's content. We had a big party, and thus were free and merry to order exponentially. I believe we ordered 10 plates in all (for 7 adults and 2 kids), which promptly required the waitress to question whether we ordered enough. At that point, I was concerned about my life choices. But after the lunch, we were more than sufficiently full.\n\nHighlight 1: I got the table to sample alligator. Cochon's fried gator is dang tasty, with a wonderful chili-garlic mayo that's only subtly spicy. Of the remaining small plates, the mushrooms were overtly soupy, and the soaked cornbread that came with the shrimp had to be eaten immediately, lest it get soggy. On the flipside, I loved the simple pan-roasted shrimp, and the carrot-cauliflower salad was refreshingly healthy in a meat-laden meal.\n\nHighlight 2: All right, the good stuff. Ipso facto, the \"cochon.\" Cochon's braised pork cheeks get most of the swine love, but I went crazy for the smoked pork ribs, the best ribs I've eaten this side of Pappy's in St. Louis. The ribs are sweet and tangy with a bit of an Asian punch. Don't get me wrong, the pork cheeks were amazing as well. The grapefruit bits were rivaled only by the inspired pomegranate seeds atop the ham hock, though the winner amongst accoutrements had to have been the ham's underlying sweet potato puree.\n\nHighlight 3: I debated heavily between the gulf fish and the catfish courtboullion, eventually opting for the former. I likely wouldn't have gone wrong either way, but that fish was simply, expertly, and perfectly cooked. The oyster-bacon is a beast of a sandwich.\n\nAs far as ordering goes, I recommend heavily leaning on the boucherie and entrees sections. The small plates are fine, but as long as you're in New Orleans, and as long as you're in as fine an establishment as Cochon, the sole purpose of your trip should be to loosen the belt buckle by a notch. Get the good stuff. Enjoy.", "date": "2015-01-14 18:43:33"}

The absolute best part about the evening were the Grilled Oysters and the Fried Chicken Livers on the appetizer menu and the Mac and Cheese as a side. The rest of the food was tasty comfort food, fancied on the plate but nothing to really write home about. I would go back again which is why it gets 3-stars from me but the reason it goes no higher are these:\n\n1. Reservations are tight and I was only able to get one at 5 pm on a weeknight so I jumped at it. When I called to see if I could add a person to my party I was given a fairly hard time about it (excuse me for trying to increase your business). Eventually I was told that they could accommodate 1 more person on my reservation after I felt like I had to sell a kidney to get it done. On arrival, the restaurant was occupied by 4 customers. That's right, 4. And it stayed that way for a good 2 hours. Now I understand that staffing and turning tables is a tricky science but I don't understand why you would give me a hard time about adding 1 person to my table at 5 pm in the afternoon when the place was completely empty and remained that way for 2 hours. I felt like they were allergic to wanting to fill the place up upon opening.\n\n2. We were told that the Fried Chicken Livers came with 3 to an order. I asked if they could add 1 more to the plate to accommodate the number of people at the table and just charge us extra for the additional liver. The kitchen refused so we ended up having to order an additional full order and had too many. Is it too difficult to fry up 1 chicken liver? We were willing to pay for it and were not asking to change the recipe. \n\nIn the end, it really was the lack of customer-centric service that drags this place down for me. I have no doubt that the kitchen is skilled and that Donald Link is a big name in the hospitality industry in this area but I think they could really benefit from focusing on how their no-can-do attitude portrays itself to the consumer.", "date": "2015-01-24 19:29:24"}

The atmosphere was very classy and elegant with a lot of wood tones. After waiting for a bit, we were seated in the corner of the restaurant at the booth, which was perfect for our party of 7. We ordered a ton of food... even double orders on some of the dishes. For appetizers, we started out with:\n\nWood Fired Oysters with chili garlic butter ($14)- this was the most AMAZING dish of the night. seriously. The chili garlic butter sauce was kind of cajun style... It was so flavorful, and eating the oysters with the hot juice was the best. We ordered more because we couldn't get enough! 5/5\n\nMeat pie with spicy mayo ($9)- Again another amazing dish so we ordered another one... the meat pie was nice and crispy on the outside and the inside was very hearty and the meat was delicious. Another favorite dish from the menu. 5/5\n\nPan roasted shrimp with cornbread and country butter ham ($14)- This dish tastes exactly like the description. The shrimp was well done and the cornbread surprisingly went well with the shrimp. 3/5\n\nFried Alligator with chili garlic mayo ($12)- Wow. After seeing everyone rave about this dish, I finally understand why. This dish with the seasoning and everything combined was perfection. The alligator was the perfect amount of chewy, and the fried part was delicious. 5/5 \n\nFried poached Egg with pickled kohlrabi & goat cream cheese ($11)- Who even thinks about frying a poached egg? It' was actually really good... On top of that, I dont even like goat cheese, but it was a great subtle compliment. 4/5\n\nFried sausage special- We didnt even order this dish, but we took it anyways. It was another solid dish, and the string beans was a nice complement. 4/5\n\nPaneed pork cheeks with creole cream cheese grits and dried figs ($12)- This dish was great. The pork was very tender, and the grits went well with pork cheek. So many combinations here that I have never tried, and all were delicious. 5/5\n\nCarrot, cauliflower and raisin salad with curry mayo and pecans ($10)- A light and refreshing dish compared to everything else. The server recommended this, and I would as well. 4/5\n\nOn to the entrees...\n\nBraised ham hock with sweet potato puree, brussels sporuts & pomegranate ($26)- This was the best ham I have ever had. The ham was so succulent and juicy and tender... Need I say more? 5/5\n\nLouisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage & crackins ($24)- Another fantastic pork dish.. the cochon is basically their specialty pulled pork dish. the crackins also added a nice texture. 4/5\n\nRabbit & Dumplings ($23)- This was another great entree. I love rabbits and dumplings, and Cochon knows how to to make their food. The gravy was thick and rich, and the biscuit was hot and fluffy. The rabbit was hearty, and this plate overall was delicious. 5/5\n\nBeef short rib with potato risotto & fermented beets ($27)- The short rib was so tender- we didnt even need a knife to cut the meat.  The fat made it flavorful, and the potato risotto was yummy. 4/5\n\nFor dessert, we got the king king ice cream and the cochon mess. The king king ice cream was very interesting.. we weren't used to the very rich and too sweet flavor. Didn't really like it. The ice cream was very thick.. it didn't even melt the whole time it was on the table. The cochon mess on the other hand, was fantastic. It is a mix of meringue cream and the baked meringue, so you get soft and crispy at the same time as well as other toppings. Yum. \n\nThe drinks here were also very good (I dont remember what I ordered). Overall, the best dinner I had at New Orleans! Love how the chefs here have a totally different perspective on food than in LA- I know that I will not find this cajun/ creole infused food in Los Angeles. I will miss this; hopefully I'll be back one day!", "date": "2015-02-10 22:33:24"}

I landed at the airport, checked in to the hotel, and then went straight to Cochon. Didn't pass go, didn't collect $200.\n\nInternet research prior to my New Orleans trip dictated that this place was an absolute must and it turned out to be true. Everything on the internet is true. Cochon was great and it definitely set the culinary tone for the remainder of the trip.\n\nThe food was phenomenal. The fried alligator for an appetizer is a great choice, especially if you're not from New Orleans. As a Seattleite (an area far away from any alligator population) it was my first time eating gator and Cochon definitely made me want to eat it more. After that, I made a point to keep an eye out for Alligator on all future menus (I may or may not have contemplated stealing a few alligators and shipping them back to Seattle to live on the Puget Sound, but  I didn't because I'm not a biologist and I'm sure there are legitimate reasons why they aren't already in Seattle...). And the chili garlic aioli... ermahgerd. So good. I would use it instead of body wash every day, provided I could refrain from shoveling it in my face while I was showering.\n\nI ordered the Louisiana cochon for dinner and it did not disappoint. Smoky and delicious. The cracklins were a nice textural porky piece that complemented the cochon very well. \n\nI know Cochon didn't get popular because of its cocktail program, but the reason they lose a star is because I wasn't impressed with the cocktail selection or execution. They're definitely trying to craft unique drinks here, but in my opinion, the cocktails quite obviously pale in comparison to the food. They do have a fairly impressive beer selection though, so pick your poison. I would try the cocktails again, but I would probably get a beer first. Beer probably complements their food menu better anyway.\n\nGet a reservation. Show up hungry. Enjoy. Well worth a visit. I'll definitely be back on my next trip!", "date": "2015-02-13 00:37:52"}

Unfortunately everyone else in the city - or least the near vicinity - seemed to have the same idea. By the time I got near enough to see the line, I had already thought better of it. \n\nSo on the third day we 'settled' for an early Friday lunch at Cochon. Showing up right as they opened at 11am allowed us to be one of the first tables seated, though the place quickly filled up. Our small outdoor table on a temperate day made for a good casual lunch.\n\nOur server wasn't the most enthusiastic, but hey we all have those days. She was still pleasant, but I think wasn't in the mood to explain menu items to some of our more 'inexperienced' diners. Maybe the fact that I was also geeking out over the plethora of pork made everyone else's attitude seem more subdued also. Who knows. But it was Friday, I was at Cochon with nowhere to be, and a world of pork at my fingertips, ripe for ordering. \n\nAt the risk of starting to sound like an alcoholic in the desert, once again I bemoaned the fact that I wasn't drinking as I perused the cocktail, beer and cider list before settling for an arnold palmer.\n\nFood-wise, it was clearly unique. To satisfy my pig craving, we started with the boucherie plate. If you're not familiar with the term - as I wasn't - it's a cajun term often applied to a communal butchering. As far as it applies to the plate though, think charcuterie. \n\nBeautifully executed bits of rillette, pate, cured meats and terrine with ground mustard, toasts, house pickled vegetables (including beets!) Good to share a few starting bites, or to make a meal out of for one. \n\nFor my entree, I selected the Oyster & Bacon Sandwich. Fried oysters, house-made bacon, toasted bread and mayo. Obviously it was divine. I'd revisit Cochon without hesitation.", "date": "2015-02-14 18:36:22"}

She recommended that I wait for a seat at the Chef's counter so I obliged; it was totally worth it because I got to see the action in the kitchen from my seat as I enjoyed my cocktail and waited for my food to arrive. I immediately took a liking to the dynamic of the kitchen staff - they were fun to watch and speak with. It's always a joy to see the inner workings of a restaurant and experiencing how my food is prepared before it gets to me adds to the overall impression of the meal. \n\nI ordered the fried gator and boudin balls to start. The gator was favorite bite of food of the night. It was succulent and reminiscent of dark meat pork and fitting considering the name Cochon adorns the building. The textures were great - crispy yet soft; tender with just enough chew. The remoulade was well balanced and did not overpower the natural flavor of the gator. It was dang tasty! The boudin balls were just okay for me. They were perfectly fried and crisp without being greasy, but the flavor profile just didn't do it for me. I had a certain expectation from boudin especially with Butcher next door. I wanted it to be meaty with a hint of offal and instead got a pastrami fritter of sorts. Good, just not what I expected. The pickled banana peppers that came with it were fantastic!\n\nConsidering it was my first time at Cochon, I decided to try their namesake: the Louisiana cochon. As much as I wanted to love this dish, I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. The entire dish, each component rather, was well seasoned and delicious. It's just that it was overly salty when eaten altogether. They were just shutting down the kitchen as I received my entree so I didn't want to make a fuss. Given that, I would still come back to Cochon to try this dish once more, but only after I get my hands on that short rib dish I originally wanted to order!  I'll give the restaurant 4 stars for the service, decor and that gator dish! The food is definitely delicious; i just came at an off period during service.", "date": "2015-02-24 23:02:16"}

I've been wanting to get to the restaurant for a few years but never was able to get a reservation in time. Luckily, this time was different and got a table for six at a very reasonable time (6:30 pm). \n\nThe meal was excellent. Started off with a Tramp Stamp (which sadly is unavailable where I live) before switching to wine. For appetizers the table shared the fried alligator (delicious), chicken livers (had a sweet jelly which was a nice touch), ribs (oh yeah) and the wood fired oysters. The oysters had a red garlic sauce that added to the taste but made it messy to eat. All four were a nice way to start the meal. \n\nAlso, I need to mention the rolls. Order up on those!\n\nFor dinner, I went with the ham hock where the meat fell right off the bone. Not a big fan of brussel sprouts but these did not seem so bad. I was also able to try the Louisana cochon (think pulled pork cooked like a crab cake) which might have been better than my meal and also the rabbit and dumplings. That had a nice homey stew taste to it though it did not look heavy on rabbit. For sides, we went with the mac and cheese (awesome) and the double baked potato. The potato was by far the \"worst\" part of the meal as it was only good. But there's no way I am knocking any starts off for that.\n\nDefinitely hit this place up when you are in Nawlins.", "date": "2015-02-27 02:25:41"}

We were not seated until 40 minutes later, 20 minutes before the kitchen was about to close, because the only table that could seat seven was occupied. I understand that they had no control over their customers' stay, but they should have been more time aware of our reservation and the party before. The hostess was kind enough to serve us spiced moonshine on the house and try to seat us immediately after the part before left. \n\nNow for the food. For the appetizer we had fried alligator tails and it was good, but not anything special. The wood-fired oysters was spiced perfectly and I wished I ordered more. I had the special which was pork loin with dirty rice. It reminded me of a traditional Korean BBQ and the rice was seasoned nicely, not too salty but just enough to compliment the pork loin. I also had the ribs with watermelon sauce and I give it too thumbs up. The watermelon sauce actually brought out the juices of the ribs. We also ordered the rabbit and dumpling and normally I don't like rabbit because I find it to gamey, but this rabbit just fell apart in your mouth and whatever thick broth it was cooked in made it mouthwatering. For dessert I had the German chocolate cake and I was wondering if I could have some more right now! It was not overly sweet and the coconut just added to the texture and another dimension of sweetness. \n\nOverall, my experience here was lovely other than the wait time.

This farm to table restaurant is full of creativity, exploration of tastes, and fun. Like many establishments in the Warehouse District, the restaurant has given new life to an old brick building and reinvigorated its classic Nawlins character. Underneath the classic sign hanging over the sidewalk are trees planted in containers and tables beckoning passersby to stop for a moment and experience an outstanding taste sensation. The inside has bare red brick walls, eclectic artwork with black and white photos of farms, wood floors, a wooden bar, and open floor plan with visibility into the kitchen and the wood-fired oven. Everything about it has a contemporary, tasteful look and feel. The young staff is attentive and professional, and exudes the energy of a team that sincerely cares about high quality food and fine dining. We ordered an appetizer (oysters), a small plate (grilled shrimp), a salad, and one entr\u00e9e (Louisiana cochon). Everything was excellent, but we decided the taste of the shrimp dish topped everything else. The various ingredients made for an incredible flavor profile with not one ingredient standing out or overpowering the others. It just blended perfectly and would not have been the same without each one of the ingredients. I've looked for this dish on the Internet and have not found it, although Chef Link apparently makes several variations of it. That's the thing with a creative chef - the menus vary frequently.

It was surprisingly good, reminded me of a tougher shrimp and the sauce was spot on, so it didn't matter if it was shrimp, calamari or even alligator, you can fry and dip just about anything in that sauce. We then got a few orders of the smoked oysters also in their spicy sauce. Get these as well as they are delicious, plump and full of flavor.

Then we got a few more orders of their smoked ribs per everyone's suggestions and my mom says that they are the best ribs she's ever had in her life.

Then, wait for it, pork, pig, lardon, greatness hit the table.  I had to tell the Love of my Life I would return to the conversation shortly as I excused my my knife.  It stayed clean the entire meal.  I took the back side of my fork and just lightly pressed until the foliation of evidence unveiled drippings unknown to mortals.  I cannot even express the pressed in parts that touched the sweet potatoes, some had brussel sprouts, some had pomegrante seeds.   He got a sammich.  Anyway, back to me.  \n\nMy Life is Complete.\n\nOh and the decor is spot on.  Light woods and cramped tables that allowed us to share breathing air with an actor on one side and an author on the other.  Super Groovy NOLA is.   Excited to be more and more part of this City.  See you in a few weeks.", "date": "2015-03-18 20:37:17"}

I visited in June 2014. After a long afternoon of walking around NOLA in the humidity and much needed thunder storms to relieve said humidity, my boss and I were hungry and came across Cochon. The place was modern yet still felt very welcoming. We were seated at a bar top right by the kitchen so that we could watch the chefs in action (we're food scientists so we couldn't resist). The server and chefs were so nice and they gave us some homemade headcheese as an appetizer. It was impressive, but I'm not a huge fan of gelled formed meat. I generally don't eat fried food, but I decided that since I was in the south, I would splurge. I ordered fried chicken with watermelon salad and mac'n'cheese. Sadly, I was disappointed with the chicken- the skin was so thick and fatty and although the outer layer was crispy, the chicken overall was just not that flavorful :( The watermelon salad was delish as was teh mac'n'cheese (so creamy and crispy on the top layer!).", "date": "2015-03-19 20:16:17"}

The cocktails were excellent and the rib was fantastic.  Coming from the Northeast, I'm not used to vinegar based BBQ sauce, so this was new to me.  I don't know if I prefer the vinegar base, but it's a really tasty alternative to tomato based sauces.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the Louisiana Cochon.  I really enjoyed this meal.  It came with a few veggies and, oddly enough, a couple of pork rinds on top.  I don't eat pork rinds, but I gave them a try with the pork and I really enjoyed the salty crunch that the rinds added.  My only issue with this dish was that the meat was a tad dry, but hardly enough to be a true problem.\n\nWe opted for a liquid dessert and got a sweet moonshine flight.  I've never had moonshine, but I know now that it's as strong as I've heard.  I'm glad it was shared because it would've knocked me out.", "date": "2015-03-20 18:00:17"}

Unfortunately, the service at both the hostess stand and the table service was awful.  We arrived early for our reservation, but waited about 70 minutes, 40 minutes longer than walk-ins that arrived after us because we were skipped over by the three hostesses. When I went up to check that we were on the list, after a number of walk-ins were seated before us, the lead one/manager told me that we were in the system and we were next. After another four groups were sat over another 20 minutes, I was told it was because she was setting us up with an inside table, even though most people sat, were sat inside, and she never asked whether we wanted to sit inside our out. After we were finally sat, or server promptly delivered water and forgot about us for 15 minutes. We eventually were able to order and the food arrived promptly and was incredible. We had the bouchon plate, fried poached egg with kohlrabi, pork cheeks, grits, greens, and LA cochon with cabbage and cracklins. The food was as incredible as it always is at Cochon. Getting drink refills and the check paid were as inefficient as the hostess stand. With all of the waiting, our quick lunch took over 2.5 hours, and would have been much longer, but the kitchen cranked the food out quickly. As great as the food was, the service killed the experience though. There are too many great options in the great city of New Orleans to return for service like this. The only person who showed great service was the server's assistant. He actually rang our check, after seeing our waitress pass by us so many times.

The nuggets of fried alligator ended up being the most generously portioned dish, without much flavor beyond the aioli. Thin brown crust graced the tops of the plush mound of Parker house rolls. Rabbit & dumplings were rustic and thickened just enough, though I personally would have been happier with smaller dumplings and more rabbit. Pork tongue was surprisingly under-seasoned, but still not as disappointing as the simple braised beef. Desserts were okay: fudge strawberry ice cream was rich and subtle on fruit, the strawberry pocket pie evoked nostalgic strawberry shortcake notes, and the pineapple upside-down cake was moist with a pretty shell.\n\nThree and a half stars.

I'm not docking points for this because we brought it up to the server, who offered to take it back and make us another one, but we declined.\n\n-Crawfish pie (it's like an empanada): My friends really liked this but I didn't care for it, possibly because I don't like crawfish (it was my first time eating crawfish so I'm not sure).\n\n-Grits: ORDER THIS. None of us were grits fans, but this side dish won us over, probably due to the insanely tasty amount of cream and butter in it.\n\n-Oyster and bacon sandwich: Delicious! The bacon was thick, crisp and flavorful -- no wimpy Oscar Meyer bacon here. The breading on the fried oysters was also thick and crunchy, and the oysters inside were creamy.\n\n-Pineapple upside down cake: Good, but I only had a small bite of my friend's order, so I can't speak much to it.\n\n-Butterscotch pudding: My other friend and I both ordered it, and when we took that first bite we almost died right then and there at the table.

It's funny.  I took French for 8 years from Middle School up until college, and I had no idea what \"cochon\" meant until I looked at the menu and noticed all the delightful pork dishes.  Fail #1. What's funnier is that we chose to go to this place on a Friday during the lent.  We're Roman Catholics.  Roman Catholics don't eat meat on Fridays during Lent.  We knew this going in, but we still wanted to try some of their other dishes.  Fail #1.5.\n\nNo, we didn't get to try the smoked pork ribs, nor did we get to try the rabbit and dumplings, or braised beef short rib, etc, etc, etc.  But we did get the wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter, the fried alligator with chili garlic mayo, and the grilled shrimp with roasted cabbage, pickled cauliflower, and jalapeno mayo.  All this, along with some local craft beers and ciders, made for an awesome dining experience.  Let's just say these three appetizers alone were the highlight of our trip.   \n\nNot only that, but our waitress was SUPER accommodating to our religious needs, recommending other seafood dishes like catfish courtbouillon, and the oven-roasted gulf fish.  We were quite full, having sampled some other dishes from Cafe Amelie an hour earlier (Food Marathon, remember?), but we certainly appreciated the effort!

Cochon wasn't on Opentable, so I just called the restaurant. I called 2 weeks before our trip and was able to get a Saturday evening reservation for 4 for either 6 PM or 9 PM - I chose the latter. \n\nWhen we arrived, the place was packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes until a table opened up. The place had a very laid back vibe with the d\u00e9cor and lighting. Their music was awesome; playing 90's R&B and Hip-hop. My friends and I forgot we were in New Orleans for a second since Cochon had a very NYC/Brooklyn-y feel. The service was great; our glasses were never empty! Staff could have been friendlier but they were just really busy and we felt it but our waitress did help point out which dishes could be made Gluten-free for my friend. \n\nI ordered the Louisiana Cochon w/ Turnips, Cabbage, & Cracklins ($24). The Pork was tender and super-flavorful. There was some sauce which the turnips and cabbage were bathed in and the cracklins were on top, which ensured that they'd remain crunchy. Whenever I took a bite, I'd try to get a little bit of the protein, veggies, and cracklins which created a great balance of textures and flavors. My girlsfriends tried my pork and thought it was really good as well! 2 of my friends had the Smoked Pork Ribs and my other friend had the Gulf fish which was Gluten-free. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their dishes and I tasted everyone's and they were all good! \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place!", "date": "2015-04-27 20:15:37"}

It sits comftrably inbetween casual and fine dining to where there isn't a dresscode but the waiters are highly trained and knowledgeable the food presentation is gorgious and there's the little things like silverware replacement after each course and a hot towel for your saucy rib fingers. Myself, my Dad and a friend decided to crush as much of the menu as we could. We all ordered something different and we spared no expense. We ordered enough food to feed a party double our size. We were in town for Jazz Fest and I had been studying the menu for months. It lived up to the hype. \n\n\nWe started off with WOOD FIRED OYSTERS W/ CHILI GARLIC BUTTER and CRAWFISH PIE. These were the best oysters I've ever had. The chili garlic butter was insanely flavorful and rich. Crawfish pie is classic New Orleans and was also incredible! Next came the GRILLED SHRIMP W/ROASTED CABBAGE, PICKLED CAULIFLOWER & JALEPENO MAYO, SMOKED PORK RIBS W/ WATERMELON PICKLES and CORN CUSTARD W/SPRING ONION SABISE & CRAB SALAD. The shrimp dish was pretty different, the combined ingredients complimented each other very well. The same goes for the corn custard with crab salad. Very rich and unique and beautifully plated. But the highlight of the entire meal came with my ribs. Hands down best ribs I have ever had! The sauce was perfect! Incredible BBQ sauce, nice and spicey but not too spicey. My mouth is watering as I type this.\n\nWe ain't done yet! Finally came the final course. My father had the RABBIT AND DUMPLINGS with LIMA BEANS, I had the LOUISIANA COCHON W/ TURNIPS, CABBAGE & CRACKLINS with MACARONI AND CHEESE and my friend slowed it down a bit with FRIED ALLIGATOR W/ CHILI GARLIC MAYO and SMOTHERED GREENS. My Cochon was glorious! A giant lump of pork sat on a bed of cooked cabbage and broth surrounded by cracklins (AKA pork rinds) and sprinkled with tiny cubes of turnips. When you touch the cochon with your fork it crumbles in to juicy pulled pork. When you get a little bit of all of the items on your fork at once it is pure euphoria! Their signature dish is out of this world! The crunch of the cracklins really set it off. The rabbit and dumplings was delicious and my Dad loved it. Which was surprising because he's not one to try new things but I made him cause we're in New Orleans! The gator was great. Not so different from the gator I'm used to but the sauce set it apart from the usual ole gator tail. The sides were also all fantastic! Obviously you can't go wrong with Mac n cheese. It was incredible! I'm not a big lima  bean fan but even they were good. It was almost more of a split pea soup tasting caserole than just your regular lima bean.  Couldnt complain about The callerd greens either. \n\nThere is a long list of restaurants I want to get to in the Crescent City. I have a lot to go yet but I'm not sure if this experience can be topped. Maybe it's cause its just right up my alley. I love it's food and style. There is also the Cochon Butcher next door. It's run by the same company and is more of a sandwich shop and bar... and butcher. It is also super awesome (check out my review) I can't wait to get back to NoLa and try some of the other exciting grub from both Cochon and Butcher. I need to move there so I can eat this incredible food more than just once a year. This city and it's food, music and culture is pure nirvana for me. Now I gotta find something to eat that will satisfy the hunger writing this review has caused. Damn you Yelp!", "date": "2015-05-20 19:17:28"}

The fried alligator was great! It was smothered in a chili chipotle aioli that gave it great flavor! The bigger pieces were a little chewy, so I preferred the smaller bites. I tried a bite from my coworker's cochon dish and thought it was pretty good too! My rabbit and dumplings dish was almost like a chicken pot pie. Slightly heavy on the Rosemary and pepper, but the overload on carrots gave it some sweetness. It was good, but i don't know if I'd order it again, I'd want to try all their other things! After finishing our meal, it took us so long before we could get a server to get us the check. I think the manager noticed me constantly looking around for our two servers - who were both just chatting by the bar - so she went and grabbed them both and pointed to our table to signal that we needed them. I'm glad the manager noticed us, otherwise we probably would have waited 30 min before getting our check!

However, our waiter was one of the rudest, snottiest little snobs that I have had the misfortune to come across as a diner. First of all, he practically ignored us, I assume either because we are a biracial couple or because we are young (both my fiance and I are 21.) However, that does not mean we weren't spending money or weren't worth his time! I had to lean in to hear what the chef's special was when he told the table next to us, as he never told us, and that's actually what we ended up ordering. He also did not bring us bread, and when I noticed all of the other tables received bread I had to ask a different waiter to bring some out. I then ordered an Angry Orchard apple ale and he spent the LONGEST time staring at my ID, then back at me, then holding it up to my face, when the ID picture looks just like me because it IS me. Frankly it was embarrassing and rude as hell. Then, after practically being ignored through our whole dinner, I ordered the chocolate cake and when I saw it had nuts in it, I told him I was unaware it had nuts in it and didn't want it as they make me ill, but would still pay for it. He rudely said, \"Well, the menu says it's German chocolate cake, and German chocolate cake is known for having nuts and coconut in it.\" Excuse my ignorance, Sassypants. All that aside, the chef's special that we ordered that night was the pork shank with corn, snap peas, and chanterelle mushrooms in a lemon sauce and it was absolutely HEAVENLY. The pork just fell off the bone, tender and delectable. We also got alligator as an appetizer that was delicious. Overall, I wish I could say we had a good experience here but it was ruined by our waiter. Really disappointing, especially when we spent upwards of $100 for a meal for two.

The fried alligator in a tangy sauce was very good. The boucherie was also very good.  The pork dish was delicious. My only criticism is the pork and the alligator were heavy on the sodium.

(Edit) Had dinner here last night and the service is awful. Our waiter Vince looks at us like we're an inconvenience. Hasn't checked in on us since he took our order. (Edit: he checked on us once when we were halfway through the entree.  Still not the same attentiveness he gave other tables.  The Cochon was saltier than I remembered and my boyfriend's short rib was also salty). I moved out of NOLA 3 years ago but I lived in the warehouse apartments across the street.  I ate here a number of times and used to take all my visiting friends here. Safe to say that I came here full of hope. Sadly the manager also hasn't checked on us either even when he was just sitting in the front when the rush died down. Our waiter spoke of specials to the table next to us but didn't share the wisdom with us. Oh wells I came here knowing what I wanted. Cochon and Fire roasted oysters. It saddens me that Vince, the manager, and the salty food ruined this experience. I feel I've been very patient during our hour and a half wait (even though we expected an hour originally we sat waiting knowing the food is worth the wait) and then to be greeted with a server who seemed like he lost the lottery when we sat down is pretty disheartening.  Also I had to ask for bread twice. The first time he said it was coming out of the oven and the second time I asked the server who brought the oysters.  She came right back with them. Vince didn't even care if we got the bread or not. Clearly he just wanted us to leave. Never planning on coming back. \n\nThank you to the Cochon staff for reminding me that not everyone in Nola is nice and that  I think unhospitable people shouldn't be in the restaurant business.", "date": "2015-06-02 02:40:23"}

Never had ham that good, pork incredible but would have liked more than one crackling, beef rib cooked to perfection and rabbit dish very nice.  All dishes had small but nice addition of some vegetables done very well.   Okra side dish was tasty and Mac and cheese was very good.

The host kindly offered a table, the bar, or the chef's bar. I sat at the chef's bar, being a party of only one person and not intending to drink.\n\nI ordered a lemonade, the okra and tomato stew as my starter, and two sides for my entree: the mac & cheese and lima beans. The lemonade was listed as homemade, but wasn't anything special. The okra and tomato stew was excellent with a lot of flavor! It was a special that day, so definitely try it if you have the chance. The kitchen also sent me an appetizer with crostini, sweet pickles, pickled beets, and a kind of meat aspic. This also was very tasty--a good balance of flavors. The mac & cheese  was a bigger portion than I expected, but was also flavorful and unique in that it had onions inside of the dish. The lima beans were rich and cooked well, though there seemed to more pork than beans in the dish! I also ordered the butterscotch pudding for dessert as recommended by the server, which was also perfect, because it wasn't too sweet, but also plenty rich. It came with a pecan cookie, which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nAs for the service, I understand that as a party of one that it's not a priority for the server to constantly check on me. However, I was a little disappointed that the server only asked how things were once the entire (3 course) meal. And I noticed that her section seemed to be full the entire time I was there, though about half of the restaurant was unoccupied--making her seem extremely busy and thus harder to get a hold of.\n\nFurther, the foodrunners brought my two entree dishes before my appetizers were cleared. (When I ordered I clarified that I wanted the appetizers as *starters* and then the side dishes as entrees.) This became a little overwhelming to have four plates in front of me. And no one offered to bring me a clean share plate--which I remedied by using one that came underneath one of the dishes. The bussers didn't ever clear away my dishes until I set them aside after a while of not using them. After finishing dessert, I ended up eying the manager to give me the check.\n\nOverall, this seems like a very busy place, for good reason--the food is awesome. The service is okay, but not perfect. I think if you're alone you might be better off at the bar, which is a shame, because seeing the open kitchen was pretty cool.", "date": "2015-06-23 21:12:48"}

The meat was laying on a bed of braised turnips and cabbage in a nice vinegar sauce that cut through the richness of the pork.  And oh yeah...perfect cracklins to top off the whole deal.

It was pretty good. \n\nWe ordered the boucherie plate which had Hog Head cheese which was awful, also had salami, mortedella which was less them paper thin. \n\nNot a place for someone that eats low carb and doesn't eat fried food. Highly over rated.\n\nPlace is crowded, seats are too close together and very loud music. \n\nI felt that the chef was not very good at \"marrying\" the flavors.", "date": "2015-08-02 16:55:04"}

Oh me, oh my, you haven't truly feasted until you venture to New Orleans and venture into Cochon!\n\nWe arrived there on a Friday shortly before 5pm and there were only a handful of patrons dining (everyone was either rushing from work to get home or stuck in traffic trying to leave town). With more than ample seating, reservations were not needed and we were seated immediately in a booth. (Also, casual attire was perfectly fine despite the upscale ambiance. I love dining in this area because of the more relaxed dress codes at many dining establishments.)\n\nOur friendly, attentive server took our orders and then brought a bucket of complimentary mini golden, buttery, toasted, soft, and delectable dinner rolls. For appetizers, wood-fired oysters drenched in chili garlic butter rocked my world! Seriously, the perfectly roasted oysters were meant to be eaten slowly so that each bite could be savored. Those buttery dinner rolls were put to good use as I soaked up every drop of the chili garlic butter. The next appetizer was the fried blue crab claws in lemon brown butter. The seasoned breading + fresh crab claws + lemon brown butter was a great medley of texture and flavor. I've had had crab claw appetizers countless times but never have they been uniquely fried as these were. Cochon has thoroughly spoiled me with their fried crab claw appetizer. Try them and your world will never be the same.\n\nObviously, when dining at Cochon, you order cochon! For the entree, we decided to share the Louisiana cochon with cabbage, cracklins, and pickled peaches, along with a side of the twice-baked stuffed potato. Again, the chefs have created an excellent dish with the harmonious medley of textures and flavors. The cochon was crispy on the outside, but tender, tasty and moist on the inside. The cochon was served atop a cabbage-pickled peach mixture that paired well with the meat. The delicious twice-baked stuffed potato was comfort food, which enhanced the flavorful cochon. For the crunch factor, the cracklins laid proudly on top of the cochon, beckoning you to come in closer for a bite. That crunch factor sealed the deal for our meal!\n\nWith it being another hot summer day, we chose the coconut angel food cake, with lemon peach sorbet and coconut macaroon. The cake was fluffy and not too sweet and paired well with the fruity sorbet. The coconut flavor was subtle and not overwhelming. After such a heavy meal, this light dessert was quite refreshingly welcomed by our palates.\n\nWhen in NOLA, Cochon is definitely a must (and over 1900 reviews to prove it)! I love how incredibly talented the chefs are at Cochon and their use of fresh, seasonal ingredients in their perfectly executed dishes. Hurry up and get started on your culinary dining adventure at Cochon because of their stellar service and fantabulously incredi-mazing food!", "date": "2015-08-15 01:34:22"}

I'm not sure why everyone was raving about the alligator, yes the sauce is tasty but just like any other time I've had alligator it's a tough and chewy and sometimes overwhelmingly fishy meal so I honestly would skip it. The shrimp was also just ok for our tasting but in their defense we had eaten at commanders palace the night before and the cookery there is 2nd to none. \n\nWith that being said you absolutely have to get the Louisiana Cochon entr\u00e9e. It is seriously delicious. They cook pork shoulder and break it down with a pulled pork approach. They then create a sort of pulled pork patty and coat it what seemed to be a dry rub and cook it to a whole other level. It is super tender and juicy on the inside with a completely different texture and flavor on the outside. It reminded me of everything good about breakfast sausage with its flavor profile so there must have been some sage in the spices. SO GOOD!

Each morsel of liver was perfectly fried and placed on a buttered piece of bread. Although the bread and liver were delicious, what tied this dish together was the sweet jam that was spread between the bread and liver. The SMOKED RIBS were delicious, but nothing really that special. The PORK CHEEKS were the highlight of the meal. I had never had pork cheeks before, but this dish will make me seek out pork cheeks in the future. Each piece had the right amount of seasoning and was incredibly tender -- i'm drooling right now just thinking about it.\n\nFor the entree, we all shared a HAM HOCK. There was a good amount of meat in the dish and like all ham hocks, the dish was very tender.

It's shredded meat, breaded, and then pan-fried on a skillet. Three of these round shaped babies are all you get on a small plate topped with mushrooms and fried lemons as they sit on a bed of eggplant caviar. One bite of everything together was a burst of flavor in my mouth. It was rich, it was scrumptious, it was heavenly.

Meh.\n\nRabbit and dumpling - this was definitely the table's favorite.  Flavors were savory with thyme. The rabbit meat was delicious and distinctive.  \n\nHummingbird cake - good, creamy\n\nBanana split - the better dessert of the three\n\nChocolate chess pie - hits the spot for chocolate cravings.\n\nBeer Perish - my friend said it was good.\n\nCrispin pear cider - refreshing \n\nSummary : phenomenal apps. Mediocre nothing special mains with the exception of the awesome rabbit and dumplings.  Desserts good .", "date": "2015-09-27 02:35:46"}

It may be a small detail but I would have chosen something different had I known the bottle doesn't come in the vintage(s) I wanted. \nI wish he'd politely inquire if the different vintage would be okay, instead of just presenting it abruptly in his uninterested attitude.

When our turn came up, we were seated at bar-style seating that faced the kitchen. That was like winning the seating lottery. I LOVE to watch the cooks and the dishes, so my spot facing the wood-fired oven was THE BEST spot in the house. Our server was a local fellow who was welcoming and joyful, and happy to make suggestions. Cochon is a restaurant whose specialty is \"small plates,\" appetizer-sized portions that are fun to share. We chose a mix of tastes - roasted oysters, smoked ribs, smothered greens, and grits with a twist (the addition of roasted vegetables and a soft cooked egg). Our server also brought us a little present - a sampling of the head cheese. We loved sampling the interesting taste and texture combinations. We swooned over the oysters, which had a garlic and spicy creole kick to them. We could have eaten a few dozen of them. They were outstanding. The head cheese (smokey and velvety textured) was accompanied by thinly sliced homemade pickles and buttered toast squares - and this, too was a standout. The ribs were smokey thoughout and chewy, the sauce a little sweeter than I like, but still delicious. The grits / vegetable / egg combination was an interesting contrast to our other choices - and a nice counterbalance to the ribs. The greens were flavorful with shards of smoked pork - the only negative is that I hit some grit in them in one bite, otherwise they were excellent. Cochon made dining out fun and entertaining. We sensed that this place was definitely \"hot\" and \"in,\" and we add our thumbs up.

I came from Baton Rouge to eat here after reading raves about it for years. I don't think I have been this disappointed in a meal in years.  If this is what passes for good food in New Orleans, then it's not the food city it's cracked up to be. I had the Louisiana cochon with cabbage, cracklins & pickled peaches and for $24 for the tiny portion (and it was NOT a small plate item--although it sure should be one) it should have been fantastic considering the reputation of this establishment.  It was totally underwhelming and if I hadn't been starving to death due to not eating all day, I might have given this a 2 star review since hunger is the best spice--but even that couldn't help this flavorless room temperature mess.  The 1 spoonful of cabbage that was purported to contain pickled peaches and cracklins had 3 fingernail size pieces of cracklins that were so rock hard that I was afraid to eat them because I feared breaking a tooth--and I have strong teeth.  The cabbage mix was cold and when I asked if it was supposed to be cold (and this was after waiting FORTY-FIVE MINUTES ON A TUESDAY) they said \"uh no....\" and snatched the plate and returned with slightly warmed veggies and I couldn't find a piece of peach anywhere in it, so it was like eating red cabbage at a German joint.  Here's a hint:  I like my food HOT guys. The also forgot to heat the \"cochon\" which was a small ball of shredded pork like a shredded pork crab cake, the meat was room temperature and was beyond pathetic. I could have done this in a crock pot at home and it would have been a LOT better.  It was apparently premade and stored in the fridge until I ordered it and they apparently consider browning the top and bottom to be adequate to reheat the meat.  It had zero flavor other than some mild heat but it was terrible and this whole mess was criminally overpriced along with being cold and flavorless.  I had to be in the city on other business and have wanted to eat here for years, so it was extremely disappointing to discover that this has got the be the most over-rated and over-priced place in America.  The service was indifferent at best and I would NEVER come back here again.  City Pork and City Pork and Brasserie in Baton Rouge are light-years superior to this albeit similarly overpriced.  I went next door to Cochon Butcher to see if the food there was any better....you can read that review next. (Spoiler Alert: It was terrible too).\nFactor in the horrible lack of parking and you can figure out the rest--the only place to park without walking forever is $10 for \"0-8\" hours.

Crazy.\n\nThis was a highly-anticipated meal during my trip to New Orleans. Having watched a number of documentaries that feature Cochon, Donald Link, and Stephen Stryjewski, I was eager to give it a try. A buddy of mine recently got engaged, so we all went out to Cochon to celebrate for lunch. We were seated right away, and having scoped the menu beforehand, we were ready to order right away as well. We were also greeted with some very warm, fluffy brioche buns, with super-soft, yet dense butter, and a little bit of finishing kosher salt. \n\nWe went pretty much all out and got the wood-fired oysters in chili butter, fried alligator in chili mayo, mac and cheese casserole, pork knuckles, Louisiana cochon (pulled pork), and the beef brisket. Hoo boy. Absolutely everything was delicious. My favorites were the oysters and pork knuckles, mostly because of how unique they were. The chili butter with the meat of the oysters was very interesting, but very delicious. The pork knuckles were like disks of pork meat, fried and battered with pickled veggies and mint on top. Pretty killer. Everything else was great too, it was just those two dishes that really stood out. The mac & cheese casserole was super creamy and decadent, the super densely-packed cochon was pretty much melt-in-your-mouth, and the fried alligator was just excellent and had great contrasting flavors. In all, the meal was incredibly rich and hearty, so let it be known that a meal at Cochon is not for the faint of heart, or should I say the high in cholesterol, heh. \n\nWaitstaff was a bit aloof , and it took awhile to get our orders actually in, but after that, the drink and water refills came by pretty frequently. The prices in general are slightly more expensive than most restaurants in the area, but the quality is all very good, so you can be assured that you're receiving a great meal.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place for date night, or just bro brunch. Note that there aren't really any TVs in here, so you can't catch the Saints/LSU game, but you can try to schedule your meal around those times and then get to the bar as fast as you can, haha. I will definitely be back to try their other dishes and cocktails, or if I'm just feeling a really good meal in New Orleans.", "date": "2015-10-15 21:18:50"}

You may get some real oddball times for dinner (our choices happened to be either 5pm or 9pm, with nothing in between) but at least you'll get seated within a reasonable time. I think the reputation for Cochon exceeds itself. You can get more authentic Creole food elsewhere for much lower prices. \n\nHowever, if you decide to brave the long wait times, I highly recommend the fried alligator with chili garlic mayonnaise. For those who haven't tried alligator before, it's a stringier version of chicken but Cochon brings out the tenderness of each piece. The real highlight, however, is the mayonnaise. Spicy, creamy, and delicious - you can also try it with the wood-fired oysters if you decide that reptiles just aren't your thing. Although the Louisiana cochon (think pulled pork) with cabbage, cracklins (pork rinds), and pickled peaches is supposed to be their signature dish, I didn't think it was anything amazing. If you're planning on sampling a bunch of appetizers, the small plates (boucherie) will be the perfect size for one person.

But when we are there for those reasons, our time is taken up with family things or Mardi Gras parades!!

Never an empty glass so with that, I could never complain about the service.\n\nNow the food is my only complaint. How can you choose just one thing when there are so many delicious choices?!? Simply not fair. And to add to that, the pan fried pork loin sandwich with roasted brussel sprouts. So what did what any reasonable people would do, and chose two thing we both liked and split it! Since that sandwich sticks out in my mind so well, you know that was one of the items chosen. The other was the rabbit and dumplings. The sandwich was incredible! Perfectly cooked but not greasy. The bread was fresh and light and came topped with an incredible slaw that complimented the pork so well. The rabbit and dumplings were a little different than I expected. It was more like a creamy rabbit stew with carrots and potatoes. It had four biscuit halves on top that served as more of the \"dumpling\" than anything. I do wish it had a little more rabbit in it.

I was a bit disappointed with this dish, but I nonetheless I ate it all. I probably won't order it again.\n\nFor entree: I had the rabbit & dumplings. That is one popular dish as I see the chef prepare batches at a time over and over again. It was delicious! There was a bit of a kick to it, and I can definitely taste the ginger needed because of the natural gamey flavor that the rabbit meat gives off. The rabbit meat was tender just like really good chicken meat. The \"dumplings\" were very light, pillowy, little breads. Definitely the ultimate comfort food for winter. I also ordered the shrimp & eggplant dressing that tasted much better as leftovers (as I had it boxed up for next day's lunch). \n\nThe customers next to me had ordered 2 of the wood-fire broiled oysters. It was good. The garlic chili vinegar was delicious and I loved dipping my bread into it. I wish there were more of the sauce. Oysters weren't bad, but I definitely prefer raw oysters. \n\nDessert: I had the coconut lime sherbert and it was the perfect ending to dinner. 2 scoops. It was light and citrus flavor.

Starting with the wood fired oysters, I found them bland and overly saturated with butter. I preferred the Acme ones.

The pork was tasty but would have benefited from an up in temperature. All in all, not impressed with this dish. We ordered 2 coffees and a pineapple upside down cake. Our coffee came immediately but the cake took 10 minutes which defeated the purpose of having coffee with our dessert. What I really disliked about Cochon was the speed with which our experience unfolded:  break neck speed. Our plates from the appetizer had not even been completely cleared when another server appeared with the lukewarm entrees. The coffee and dessert was poorly timed and the absolute worst part of all of this was the placement of the bill on our table while we were finishing the pineapple upside cake (which was ok but nothing spectacular, by the way.) I didn't request the bill and I find it incredibly rude to have the bill placed on my table while I'm still eating, unless of course I'm sitting at a counter in a coffee shop/diner. This is especially true in a restaurant where the combined bill with tip  $140. It is obvious Cochon is supremely interested in turning the tables over and not providing the diner with an experience warranting a repeat visit. My final comment is this: Both my sister and I spent half the night in the bathroom with stomach aches and digestive \"episodes,\" something that can only be attributed to the food at Cochon. A friend in New Orleans shared she had heard of others having a similar gastrointestinal postscript after dining at Cochon. I cannot recommend this restaurant.", "date": "2015-11-15 18:13:51"}

My wife and I ordered the fried alligator, smoked pork ribs, rabbit & dumplings and an oyster and bacon sandwich. The pork ribs were absolutely fantastic; tender, juicy, flavorful - among the best ribs I have consumed anywhere! The rabbit and dumplings were like a gourmet, deconstructed pot pie. The garlic chili sauce for the fried alligator tasty, possessed a kiss of heat and balanced the slight gaminess of the gator. The only miss was the sandwich; the oysters somehow seemed to have become water logged and had an unpleasant texture and off taste. Service was adequate,  though not so good as to enhance the dining experience. Definitely a venue I'd like to return to next time I am in NOLA to partake in more of the menu and possibly check out next door sister venue, Cochon Butcher.", "date": "2015-11-17 05:06:34"}

I swear I can just pour all that butter into all my seafood platters and it'll do the job.\n\nThe alligator bites were amazing too! These were the best gator bites I've had in N.O.

I think the kitchen tried to play up the batter and I could taste a little kick, but the alligator meat itself wasn't tenderized enough (is that even possible?). I think if the alligator was pounded out and served as a katsu, it might have been better? We didn't finish this dish.\nThe gumbo was served with wilted kale, but it was so salty that the taste of kale, let alone any other ingredient, was lost. We probably had half of the bowl between the two of us. \n\nWe were very excited about the baked oysters because we sat by the kitchen and saw them prepare this. The oysters themselves are quite fresh... if you can get over the salt-content of the sauce. I think oysters are too delicate to hold their own against a sauce like that.

The wine list itself, while just one (two-sided) page, certainly had enough for pretty much anyone to find something nice, without breaking the bank.\n\nThe ambiance was lively, but not so loud we couldn't talk. People all around were friendly, talking, and laughing. The settings were comfortable, but not pretentious or otherwise off-putting. The wait staff were attentive, knowledgeable, prompt, and friendly. One of our guests found her meal to be too cool for her liking.

Sure there are new delicious and inventive dining that can be experienced at R'evolution & GWFins for example, my  visit here was rewarded with great comfort food, unencumbered, original but modern.   I love it here.  The vibe at Couchon is comfortable, user friendly and the smells from the kitchen make my day fantastic.  \n\nThis visit, I tried other items on the menu:\n\n1)  Fried alligator with chili aioli and mint.  This dish was meaty, hearty, lean and deliciously 'gatory' with a crisp crust.   If you haven't had alligator, the flesh is hearty very lean with a consistency between swordfish and chicken breast.   The aioli gave it that tease factor, the mint sent it to the level of sophisticated dishes in Thai cookery.  Sprinkle that with the pepper/vinegar served tableside and you smile.  You just do--  it's really super good.\n\n2)  Rabbit and dumplings.  This beautiful Southern serving came on a cast iron skillet, hot off the oven with browned biscuits, the pan had a rich country white gravy with  bold fresh herbs, thyme, maybe oregano, veggies, nicely done  'chickeny tasting' rabbit meat.  Definitely soul food albeit  a little salty.  Again, I wonder if the chef or person who made this dish smokes cigarettes.\n\n3)  Fig Tarte with Marcarpone Ice Cream---  Geesh God Almighty, how does a Southern resto make a genius Italian-ish dessert.  It was...nicely crusty brioche with figs and apples straight from the oven to table with a genius scoop of mascarpone ice cream.  It was, bite after bite a very satisfying dessert.\n\n**Minus one star.  While the service was attentive and friendly, the chef who made the Rabbit and dumplings overpoured the NaCl or they smoke.   Smokers oversalt  food.  I have this constant problem in Europe and Asia and can tell immediately if the chef is a smoker.    I sent it back and the resto was good enough to comp me.  Chefs who smoke should have a non-smoker taste their food/sauce right after the first seasoning.\n\nBecause the food at Cochon is so delicious and inventively good, the service totally fine; I will return.  \n\nVisits:  3\n\nTip:  Remind your waitperson to make sure your plate is not salty.  Love the vinegar/pepper bottles on tables.  This condiment is perfect on fried plates like the alligator, even the ribs appetizer. They have great cocktails here :))", "date": "2015-12-09 01:54:26"}

It did not live up to its reputation at all! And we chose to come here over Commanders Palace... Big mistake. We were quoted a 20 minute wait time for a table of 2 and waited over 40. Now I know it's technically a Holiday so I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Plus I'm in the industry and I know what it's like to quote a particular wait time and have it go over because guest just sit at tables longer than expected. But with that said a little sincerity and an apology would have gone a long way. But we received neither from her. Just an excuse and a promise that we would still be able to eat even thought they were closing extremely early. The hostess did however offer us a seat at the chefs counter after about anther 10 minutes of waiting but we were already sitting at the bar and could have eaten there a long time before that. And I like eating at a table and drinking at the bar.  Plus the bar is boring. You're just looking at a wall of liquor bottles inattentive bartenders. We ordered the grilled oysters to start but they were lukewarm at best. The shells were hot though. I'll give them that.  We sent those back and received another order. But those were also lukewarm. When we informed the bartender that they weren't up to par she immediately notified what looked like a manager. But all that Manager did was bring us a basket of bread that was already advertised as complimentary. When we decided we had had enough and canceled our order, another Manager showed up offering no apology and very little concern for our situation and looked more annoyed that he had to talk to us and offered us more excuses. He just promised that our next course would be better. But judging by the apps. We didn't want to take a chance that our entrees would be as sub par as the oysters. All in all I will never go back and am very disappointed in this Donald Link concept. I've heard so many good things about his cooking and his reputation for creating great southern inspired dishes but it looks like all he cares about now is the money and not the product he stamps his name on. We are actually rethinking visiting his other concepts now because of this really bad visit. We did however enjoy our $100 bottle of Champagne.", "date": "2016-01-01 00:08:18"}

However, I actually felt that this lack of flavor was very intentional. I was left savoring, slowly chewing, and experiencing the texture of the cheeks as each bite nearly melted in my mouth without resistance.\n\nThe rabbit and dumpling dish felt like soup for the soul. It felt like mom's healing chicken soup but a bit creamier with more substance. I liked it but didn't think it was worth $23.

This is my kind of restaurant. Everything is superb (food, service, vibe, booze), and the overall effect forms up (like Voltron) into one of my favorite places to eat, in one of my favorite towns to eat. I don't make that statement lightly.\n\nLast time we came in we didn't have a reservation because I'm a dimwitted ignoramus (stop your protests, it's true). The hostess said, \"We don't have any tables available, and there's nothing at the bar...would you be OK sitting at the Chef's Counter?\"\n\nWait, what? That's the best thing that ever happened. Hostess, you're making dreams come true.\n\nSo for our entire meal, we sat in front of that wood-burning oven and watched and smelled as mouthwatering plate after mouthwatering plate was finished and sent over to be expedited, all the while wondering why the hell we didn't order whatever happened to be walking by (the rabbit is foremost among these dishes, and the first thing I'm ordering when I come back in).\n\nSpeaking of which, order the oysters. Slathered in chili-butter and wood-fired (like everything else), nothing smells better than these, and not much tastes better. Other things I absolutely adore about this place:\n\n1. They sent a full order of hogshead cheese to us, on the house. (I'd like to believe I'm special, but everyone else got it too.) I'm a sucker for lagniappe, and a HUGE sucker for lagniappe that also happens to be charcuterie of the highest quality.\n\n2. Just about everything in this place is so very, very porky. As is fitting when the name on the door is Cochon. That hogshead cheese, the ribs, the pork cheeks (essentially a cassoulet that is perfect in cold weather), even the grilled broccoli salad (incredible) was porky as hell. I also appreciate the acid-forward flavors; the ribs especially are quite vinegary, and I loved it.\n\n3. The details matter. Everything from the music playing to the bread is carefully thought out, and it all fits. With regard to the bread (perfect little buttery dinner rolls), we thought we'd missed out, or our waiter hated us. It just turned out that they only serve the bread to you when it's hot and fresh out of the oven...the way bread should be.\n\nThe only thing I don't appreciate:\n\nThey kept trying to clear my wife's plate while she was in the bathroom. I realize you thought we were single diners because she's entirely out of my league. And I'm sure it looked like she'd left and it was time to take away her food...but it hurts that everyone on your staff came to the same conclusion that I don't look like someone who has a date. Accurate, but it hurts..\n\nIn the end, Cochon is all about hearty, unfussy, stick-to-your-ribs, absolutely fucking delicious food that I ate entirely too much of (which is OK because I'm putting on a layer of fat for winter). Pair that with a rye or bourbon cocktail, and I'm a happy, happy man.", "date": "2016-01-07 14:46:55"}

Meat plate was really good, but not much nothing outstanding. The alligator was not good. Tough and way too spicy. Had to put it down as to not over power the rest of the meal. I got the catfish courbollion and eggplant/shrimp side. courbollion was really good. Big portion. Side was amazing. Cooworkers got the off the menu special pork chop. Had a very nice flavor, but lacked any sear. Can't hold a candle to Perry's in Houston. We started with beers and the wait staff never approached us to order a second round. They did however keep our waters full. Took awhile to get the bill also. Solid place, but due to a few missteps, couldn't give it a 5. I would definitely come back.", "date": "2016-01-16 19:51:02"}

Had seen it rated on the internet as a top 10 place to dine in New Orleans.\n\nOur first time in New Orleans & the first time to Cushon.\n\nThe service was a bit rushed and not all that friendly. The bench and chairs were not all that comfortable.\n\nWe asked our server for before dinner cocktail recommendations - for a vodka drinker and a rum drinker.\n\nPer his recommendation - my wife had a COLD BLOODED vodka cocktail - it had an interesting spice flavor and subtle heat to it. Very interesting and quite different than her usual martinis.\n\nI had an ABOUT THYME rum cocktail. It was interesting but not all that memorable,\n\nThe buns that were included with the meal were very tasty.\n\nThe SMOKED PORK RIBS WITH WATERMELON PICKLE was excellent and a good sized portion to share as an appetizer.\n\nThe HAM HOCK WITH SWEET POTATOES was very good and a large portion. Maybe a little over done.\n\nThe special that night was a PORCHETTA that sounded so good - but was just average in flavor and overall experience. Just way too much pork fat left on the plate after trimming what even I would eat.\n\nWe shared a side order of BROCCOLI BACON AND a SAUCE that was very good. We were glad to have a few more vegetables and so tasty ...\n\nWe shared a HUMMINGBIRD desert which is a banana bread knock off of carrot cake. The nuts were very much like carrot cake and the creme fresh icing was similar to the cream cheese icing on carrot cake - but much lighter. A very tasty desert.\n\nEveryone seemed to be having a good time. We had a nice conversation with the couple sitting next to us.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit noisy - making conversation more strained than usual.\n\nA good meal out after a busy day driving to and visiting a couple of Plantations. It seemed too expensive for the lasting flavor and experience impact. Maybe we were just too tired.\n\nWe just happened to run into the last 3/4 of a Mardi Gras parade on the 12 minute walk back to our hotel.

The restaurant has a tapas style and ambiance with its extensive wine selection, bouchiere platter (similar to a charcuterie board), and tapas dishes. \n\nWe were first served complimentary corn bread which was the best corn bread I had in New Orleans. It was buttery and grainy. The top was baked to crisp.\n\nFor appetizer, we shared the alligator bites. It was prepared such that you could taste the difference between gator and other meats. The meat itself was a bit tough at first; however it immediately softens up once you break through it on the first bite. The gator bites were topped with slightly pickled white onions and a fresh herb. I also liked the chili garlic mayo which was mild and creamy.\n\nFor our main courses, we shared the Louisiana Cochon and the Rabbit & Dumplings. I recommend both dishes. The two were very hearty, earthy, and plentifully seasoned.\n\nThe cochon was pulled pork formed together as a patty and stove fried. The pork was still succulent, yet it now had a crispier outer layer providing a textural contrast. The cochon patty was platted over slow cooked cabbage and turnips. The ingredients married together well. It also had a few small cubes of apple which added a little sweetness to an earthy and savory dish.\n\nThe Rabbit and Dumplings was an interesting take on Sheppard's Pie. Instead of having a pie crust at the top, there were four small biscuits placed throughout the dish. The rabbit was soft and tender. It was best preparation of rabbit that I've had. All in all. this dish was extremely filling. \n\nThe service was attentive and knowledgeable. I liked the offerings of local and craft beers.\n\nI would rate it four and a half stars.", "date": "2016-02-18 23:24:39"}

You might be plain bewildered, or even discombobulated.  See, you're going to scan that menu and want to order EVERY last damn item on the menu.   Trying to decide what to omit is going to be a painful process.\n\nA week or so later, I'm still regretting stuff I didn't get to try.\n\nAnd yet, because my wife had suffered a nasty case of food poisoning a couple of night before, we went a little easy on the throttle when it came to fully sampling the porktastic greatness in which Cochon specializes.\n\nThe first thing we ordered was the best:  the onion braised pork cheeks (served w/with grits, radish & crushed herbs).  It's not all that much food for twelve dollars, but this is some of the most concentrated pork flavor you're going to get.  Hugely delicious.  We ordered the boucherie plate, which apparently is a Cajun term that refers to communal butchering of hogs.  As a plate at Cochon, it basically means charcuterie.  Here, the sausage items seemed best, along with an excellent bit of hogshead cheese.  The cured ham was good, but maybe too subtle to stand up to some of the other pork items.  Same deal with the rillettes:  smooth and creamy, but not very bold flavor.  There were a few pickles (tomatoes and cucumber) as well, which were a super-tangy contrast to the pork.  In addition, we ordered the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar off of the \"soup and salad\" section of the menu:  It was so vibrant, bright, and simple a dish as to suggest that Donald Link could open a damn good vegetarian restaurant if he wanted to.  (And that's probably a mild form of blasphemy to some when it comes to this guy.)\n\nFor entrees, we got the rabbit & dumplings and oven-roasted fish (which I'm pretty sure was redfish).  The rabbit & dumplings is basically the best rabbit pot pie you've never had (until now).  But I have to say that, by the end of it. it's flavors and textures were coming off as slightly one-dimensional, if bold and tasty.  The fish dish was fine, but did not compare to what we had at Peche a night later.\n\nSo regrets:  As I glanced at tables around me, I was already feeling them.  The fellas next to us had the ham hock and cochon entrees, which were making the rabbit and fish seem a bit light and conservative.  But across the way, a foursome had ordered one of the specials, which was a half pig's face.  That looked like just about the greatest thing ever, and the first time we'd seen it in a restaurant since a visit to Au Pied du Cochon in Montreal a few years back.\n\nThe table on our other side, with eight or ten folks was celebrating a birthday and sharing a bunch of items.  That really seems like the ideal way to go at Cochon, if you have that many folks who can join you and can score a reservation far enough in advance.\n\nAmbience-wise, Cochon is a raving, cacophonous madhouse, and it's not for everybody.  (And this was a Monday night!)  The restaurant's look--lots of wood and concrete, a sharp modern look--is pretty common these days, but not so much in New Orleans when Cochon opened a decade ago.  Tables are mashed close together, and, when you walk in, the front of the house seems to be totally disorganized.  But the staff was excellent:  Despite the appearance of chaos, they ran a smooth show the whole way through; servers took time time to answer questions about the menu over the din.  \n\nExcellent list of various types of alcohol (esp. bourbon)!\n\nNot a perfect restaurant (as suggested by some of the above commentary), but with enough distinctiveness and highs to warrant this score.", "date": "2016-03-08 13:56:12"}

Everything was fantastic... I have to even admit the oysters were better than the Acme oysters... That's right I said such blasphemy. Though, it's a different kind of preparation-- I still would say I would line up for these oysters than the ones anywhere near the heart of the French Quarter. To top it off, we had apple and fig for dessert and basically died again. \n\nAll in all, I loved the food and I also enjoyed seeing the somewhat up and coming modernity of NOLA. though some might argue against its growth killing the culture. However, I'd like to think this place thrives due to the fact that it pays homage to the NOLA culture which cultivates the idea of growing from the roots to disrupt the norm and create beauty, delicious forbidden-fruit level beauty, out of it. \n\nI pray I will return to this place in the future!", "date": "2016-03-10 15:52:52"}

Fluffy, light, the way that rolls are supposed to be but never are.\n\nCONS:\n\n- I liked the fried alligator, but to be honest I felt like it was a little too expected. There wasn't anything particularly special about it.\n- Service is a little hit or miss. Sometimes the server stopped at our table every 5 minutes, sometimes we would try to flag him down and couldn't find him at all.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience. Thanks NOLA!", "date": "2016-03-28 00:13:55"}

Since I'm in town to get around a bunch of food and drink spots, I gotta go with some \"only in NOLA\" fare, which meant the alligator bites and the cochon. \n\nFirst off they bring delicious hot yeast rolls which I believe are sourdough. I eateds two. I did not anticipate the complimentary \"amuse boche\" head cheese, if I did I would have probably stuck to one roll. The headcheese was quite excellent. Not too fatty but fatty enough to make it a marvelous, savory spread onto toast bits. Think vietnamese head cheese but a lot richer. It was accompanied with mustard and sweet pickles, which is like c'mon, are we trying to channel banh mi here? (The answer is yes.) \n\nNow the alligator bites- wow-e, fantastic! Never had alligator before, but it was surprisingly mild. It's like if fish, chicken, and frog had a baby it would taste like this. The batter was nice and crispy. The sauce quite frankly tasted like sriracha mayo which I am not hating on. The parsley and sliced raw white onion cut up the richness with some aromatic, sweet punches. \n\nNow for the crowning dish, the cochon. Omg. The cochon. This cochon will probably make Cochon my #2 favorite restaurant in the world. Tender, succulent pork packed into a a cake, pan seared, served on top of beautifully perfectly braised cabbage, big pieces of cracklin, and pickled turnip pieces. Flavor and texture perfection. I don't even like pork! The cabbage really was the star here though, I have never had better cabbage in my life. It was so flavorful and tender without falling apart. the flavor married well with the pork. Funny enough once again, it channeled some asian dishes- braised cabbage and pork is a Chinese staple and the sweet and sour element is often found in our cuisine.", "date": "2016-03-28 04:18:23"}

I have visited NOLA once before, but have never eaten at Cochon. My friend recommended that we all must eat here because it was super delicious. I have read the wonderful reviews prior to eating here, and did not have much expectation. But man oh man, this is hands down the best meal I had in NOLA! Everything was mind blowing that we all had to order seconds! Now I know why Cochon was inducted into the Nations Restaurant News Hall of Fame and was listed in The New York Times as one of the top 3 restaurants that counts. \n\nWe were a party of 10, and reservations were made weeks ago. The decor was lovely, and the staff was so attentive, friendly and wonderful. But most importantly, the foods were outstanding! The foods we ordered to share were:\n\nWood-fired Oysters w/ Chili Garlic Butter ($14) -- This was my most favorite. It was so delicious that we all got 4 orders of this. This is a must order! You won't regret.\n\nFried Alligator w/ Chili Garlic Mayo ($12) -- I have eaten alligator meat in Thailand once by mistake (someone lied to me and said it was chicken), and I got so disgusted ever since that I vowed not to eat it ever again. Well, I may have eaten my word because I ate that fried alligator ball & it was so damn delicious! That sauce was so amazing. The alligator tasted like chicken & squid. Delish!\n\nFried Livers w/ Pepper Jelly & Toast ($8) - I didn't eat this b/c I don't eat organ meats, but my friends loved it very much that this was also reordered.\n\nFried Boudin w/ Pickled Peppers ($9) - This was my 2nd most favorite! Tasty, Savory & Crunchy. The dijon mustard sauce complemented the boudin so well. We also reordered this because it was so damn good!\n\nOnions Braised Pork Cheeks w/ Grits, Radish & Crushed Herbs ($12) - This was very tender and tasty. The group loved it so much, it was also reordered.\n\nHam Hock w/ Sweet Potatoes, Picked Greens & Black Eyed Peas ($26) - The ham was so tender & the sweet potatoe pureed complemented the ham so well (like a sweet & salty combo). We liked it but it wasn't our most favorite.\n\nLouisiana Cochon w/ Cabbage, Cracklins & Picked Turnips ($24) - This is another must order! Since the restaurant is named \"Cochon\", this entree must be ordered. It was so tender, tasty, and we loved it so much we ordered seconds!\n\nOven-roasted Gulf Fish ($32) - Fish was tender and meaty, but it was a bit lacking in flavor. I wouldn't order this again.\n\nMac & Cheese Casserole ($7) - One of the best mac & cheese I have ever eaten. This is also a must order. We ordered seconds! YUM!\n\nCoconut Snowball w/ coconut cream & meringue ($8) - Couldn't leave w/o ordering desserts. I was so shocked that their desserts were that good. This is a must order! I have never eaten something so unique like this, and it was so tasty (not overwhelmingly sweet). It was also so fluffy. Damn good! This was my top dessert out of the 3.\n\nPineapple Upside down cake w/ coconut lime sherbet ($8) - This was also delicious, and not overwhelmingly sweet (b/c pineapple upside down cakes can be too sweet). This one was my 2nd fav out of the 3 desserts we tried.\n\nChocolate Hazelnut Pudding ($8) - For big chocolate lovers, you would like this very much. It was very rich, smooth, and tasty (not too sweet). It was very tasty, but not my most favorite b/c I don't really like pudding textured foods that much. But I would recommend chocolate lovers to get this.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend Cochon to anyone visiting NOLA. This is a must eat place. After eating here, I can't stop preaching to other people on how delicious it was. Wish they would open a shop in NYC one day...if not I guess I have to save my vacation days and come back to Nawlin' again.", "date": "2016-03-29 17:00:11"}

For meat, our \"smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle $12\" was amazing! So stewed down that we accidentally bit in the bone. Super sweet but maybe a bit dry.

It really does. I went to school in New Orleans. And when I get back, there's really only one thing I want to do. Eat. The last time I was here I wanted to get to Cochon. But couldn't. This time - just before Easter - I was here with my wife and two daughters. We were lucky to get an early reservation and we were psyched. The entire experience was kind of weird. New Orleans is known for its hospitality and easy spirit. The vibe here felt contrived. The food was great. It really was. From warm yeast raised rolls to the rabbit stew. Well done. But from the beginning, we felt like something was off. Our server never smiled, though she was cordial. There was definitely an attitude lurking (let's get it straight, this is Cochon, not Commander's). And then one of the server helpers (bus lady) - after attempting to clear my plate too early, spilled an entire glass of ice water into my lap. It wasn't a splash. It was a deluge. I was soaked and cold. And I laughed it off. And did my best to move on. The helper said sorry. But our server never returned. Not once. Never to say sorry, to see how we were doing, to ask if she could help. She walked by our table several times and wouldn't make eye contact. Maybe she was embarrassed. But it almost felt like she \"gave up on us.\" As if, \"well they're a lost cause so I'll move on to other customers.\" In fact, the helper who spilled the water was now relegated to finishing the service. She was now taking our dessert orders, etc. As if, \"you screwed that one up so you take them now.\" It was weird. The manager came over and apologized - but only after he realize our dessert order was taking so long. They said the Chef wasn't happy with the presentation and wanted to do it over. Bullshit. Come on. What would you expect for all of this inconvenience? A comped entree? A comped dessert? A comped meal? Well, they offered a comped glass of wine. Seriously? I didn't ask for anything, and the bill came back with a comped glass of wine. I didn't want to make a scene...I was with my kids. But I felt as if I were the one who inconvenienced them. Not the other way around.  Ultimately they settled on comped desserts (which they should have done anyway given we waited 20 minutes for them) and a comped 2 glasses of wine. It is amazing what bad service can do to ruin a great meal. We won't be back. And I'd recommend you try it only if you think you won't have a glass of ice water spilled into your crotch and only if you're willing to feel like you're dining there at their pleasure, not yours.", "date": "2016-04-02 14:52:49"}

I even came here for my bday dinner no less. Sadly it was a very lackluster and annoying experience. My first impression of the place is that it's absurdly loud. Absurdly. You can't even speak with your dining partners, you have to yell. This applies to the waitstaff as well. And that's only when they're available. Could someone please tell Mr. Link to hire more waitstaff?? These people are ran ragged trying to serve the entire dining room, I counted about 4 of them that night. What is the rationale to having so few waitstaff on the floor? It's not as though they are saving money. So strange and disappointing. This would never fly in NYC, people would laugh you out of the city. \n        Onto the eating...... So, we were served by various waitstaff throughout the evening. None of them could hear us, nor we them. Orders had to be repeated at a yell. Their beer list appears wonderful, sadly the waitress couldn't tell me the first thing about their rotating tap list. When I ordered a rare local IPA in a magnum bottle she brought out a shot glass and flung the beer into it. Absurd. There was no beer, just a shot glass of foam. A shot glass. Completely full of foam. Yes, and I paid $15 for that bottle. Again, absurd. To the food.....\n        We ordered starters- boudin and the oysters. The boudin wouldn't be a starter for a child, disappointment. The oysters on the other hand, whoa. My God, the food of the evening and perhaps the one saving grace. They were delicious, it was the taste of the sea with smoke. A genius dish. Our mains were the Rabbit and dumplings and Louisiana Cochon. Neither were very good. The Cochon was a salty overkill and the Rabbits tasted of cloying fall spices- mace, thyme, and whatever else they put in the roux. Weird, and again disappointing. Dessert didn't offer much better, chocolate pudding was well, plain old chocolate pudding. And the pineapple upside down cake, I could honestly make it just as well. Nothing you can't get in other restaurants way better. \n       After tip it was a $180 meal. That was more than Atchafalya, Brennan's, or the Upperline. All three of those were by far better meals.

Super delicious and would highly recommend it.\n\nService was great, food was delicious and we're glad this was our last meal before hopping on the plane back home.", "date": "2016-05-01 20:22:13"}

This was our first meal we had when visiting Nola, and I'm more than happy it was this place that introduced us to the authentic Cajun flavors that New Orleans had to offer.\n\nWe started with the fried alligator and the wood-fired oysters. Having never had alligator before, we didn't really know what to expect. The alligator bites were drenched in this delicious chili garlic mayo, but still retained a slight crisp on the outside. It didn't taste as \"gamey\" as I expected, but it was still very meaty and hearty. I'd describe the texture as a chewier version of chicken breast. The wood-fired oysters were amazing. They were dressed in chili garlic butter and came out piping hot. Definitely one of my favorites of our meal. A little after the appetizers were served, we were given a sample of the boucherie plate as a compliment from the kitchen. It came with really good hogs head cheese with a side of pickles and a mustard. \n\nFor our entrees, I went with the rabbit and dumplings, and my boyfriend went with their oven-roasted gulf fish. My rabbit and dumplings were served in a cast iron skillet and had about six \"dumplings\" in it. The dumplings were more like biscuits honestly. The stew was everything you imagine Southern cajun food to be - bold, hearty, and soul-warming with tons of flavor. It was a great dish to start off my Nola adventures with. I can't comment too much on the fish my boyfriend had since I had just a bite, but it was a really generous portion and well-seasoned. \n\nI'd suggest Cochon to anyone who decides to visit Nola.

From the first visit, the food has called to me, beckoning me not only to return to New Orleans, but to this restaurant to re-infuse with the flavors that I love. \n\nMy first time at Cochon was a lunch. I was sat at the bar in front of the kitchen and I got to watch the guys cranking out food in cast iron pans and their wood-fired oven. It was spectacular. And the flavors of the food were unparalleled. The crawfish pie was awesome. The gumbo was the best I tasted in the city. For me, the biggest disappointment that trip was that I couldn't bring my wife there for dinner as we ran out of time.\n\nI returned to New Orleans three months later for a work event. During that trip, a colleague and I went to dinner at Cochon. Again, the food, the service, everything was spectacular. The waitress had quit working in New York to come down and work for a time at Cochon. We had the gumbo (incredible again), and the alligator dish as my colleague wanted to try that. While it was probably the best alligator that I've had, it felt more like a check mark on a tourist list, but my colleague was happy. And then came the rabbit and dumplings -- such incredible flavor we were scraping the cast iron pan to get any last remnants we could. Again, an awesome experience.\n\nSo it was with some excitement that we booked Cochon again last night. This time, my wife and I on vacation. I was finally going to bring her to the restaurant that, for a period of time, had us planning our wedding here in New Orleans. We had actually considered having the reception at Calcasieu, the private space above Cochon, simply based on my experiences with the food. Perhaps that helps describe how enamored I was with the food at Cochon. Needless to say, we were excited to finally visit together.\n\nUnfortunately, our experience was not the awesome experience we'd hoped for. First, the restaurant was crowded, perhaps some conference or other event was in town, creating a larger crowd than you might expect for a Monday night. Twenty minutes after our reservation time, we were seated. Recently they've expanded the dining room at Cochon, so we were brought into the larger back room dining area that had lots of seats. and a number of empty tables. Overall, it looked as though they were attempting to manage when people were sat in order to avoid overwhelming the kitchen. \n\nThe food started out great. The crawfish pie was as exceptional as I remember it. The boucherie plate was spectacular. My wife loved it. And when rolls arrived, they were as good as you could imagine dinner rolls being. Somewhere late into our small plates, we placed an order for gumbo and an entree of the rabbit & dumplings. It was shortly after this, that our waiter must have started his second job at one of Donald Link's other restaurants. We sat. And we sat. I ran out of beer. At one point, a woman in a dress who looked like she might have a second job as a hostess came by, refilled our water and asked about my empty beer. Then took my wine order. My wife and I soon found ourselves on the crossword app on our phone. Some time after my wine arrived, our original waiter came back by and told us there had been an error and somehow they lost our order. He then speculated that we'd ordered something different and we re-placed our correct order. The two women at the table next to us -- a similar experience. Although the waiter did apologize to us and the other four tables around us, we were surprised that none of us received a visit from the restaurant manager. \n\nNow the problem with service issues like this is that, when the food does arrive, you start to question your palate. The gumbo, while still the best that I had in New Orleans this trip, tasted slightly burned to my wife. And the rabbit and dumplings, while quite good, tasted a bit less peppery than I remember. My wife loved it and there was pepper at the table, but the service had already stomped our buzz. We wrapped up, and eventually managed to wrangle our check from our waiter. I grabbed my card, ready to pay, and we watched our waiter go by twice without picking it up. Finally, I turned from my wife and sat, looking bored and facing to the side and staring at the restaurant manager in the corridor between the two dining rooms. Eventually, this was enough to prompt them to pick up the card and process the transaction. \n\nIn short, this is another service review and your mileage may vary. If I was in town again, I would probably try and go to Cochon again -- the food is that good -- but our experience with the service has certainly given us pause. I'll also say that I'm going home without the same craving to return that I once had. You could say that, after years of using Yelp, I was so scarred by this experience that I felt the need to write my first Yelp review.", "date": "2016-05-24 13:44:54"}

Cochon is one of the most heavily reviewed and highly rated destinations in New Orleans and for good reason.  Aside from sporting a trendy look with great wood paneling and exterior brick as well as nifty indoor balcony seating overlooking the restaurant, the cuisine is stellar as well.  Start with glorious bites of alligator drowned in a thick mayonnaise based sauce featuring notes of chili and garlic or maybe the house boudin balls (essentially, a deep fried pork and rice ball) for a Cajun treat to start.  Or, for those seeking a more seasonal treat, we also enjoyed a wonderful pork cheek dish paired with tender slivers of yellow squash, English peas, and green onions.   \n\nThere are a number of excellent choices for dinner though one would be hard pressed to beat the beef short rib over corn grits.  The tender short rib absolutely melts in the mouth and pairs perfectly with the grits.  While I only sampled the rabbit and dumplings, the meat was exquisite and this warm hearty dish would make a lovely choice especially for a cold day.  The catfish courtbouillon also impressed with a flavorful base subtly adding layers to an already nuanced preparation.  \n\nDon't miss out on dessert either (I think we ended up trying all of them).  While the pineapple upside down cake was absolutely devoured by our party, I was perhaps most partial to a rather decadent chocolate hazelnut pudding.  \n\nAt least on this visit, Cochon ended up being my favorite overall meal (even besting general favorite Jacques-Imo's).

I'm guessing some combination of brine and buttermilk before roasting, but this merits investigation.\n\nStrong hipster vibe on the staff (ink and creative facial hair) which is fine.\n\nWine list is what I like - lots of choices and variety, but one page, not a book.", "date": "2016-05-29 10:57:39"}

The wood fired oysters are every bit as delicious as people say. Big and meaty, with a nice kick.\n\nThe fried alligator was definitely worth trying (my first foray with gator). It was deep fried to the point where the cliche \"tastes like chicken\" applied, but nonetheless excellent.\n\nThe short rib was excellent, and I love pickled veggies on anything. It was served atop slow roasted grits, which was a great combination.\n\nThe pork cheeks were also a winner. You can't go to a restaurant named cochon and not get pig. We also did their namesake dish, the Louisiana cochon. The cracklins and cabbage together made for an interesting contrast between crispy and tender.\n\nHonestly, there wasn't anything I wasn't a fan of. Of course, at the end of the meal, my friends ordered me a key lime pie and they got half the restaurant to sing \"happy birthday\" to me.

The peanut vinaigrette salad dressing was light. \n\nChicken & Andouille Gumbo, $8 prior to tax- This gumbo was also kind of on the small side, but I liked the shredded chicken in the soup. The andouille sausage was good and I liked the rice in this gumbo. But I didn't think this gumbo was as good as gumbo that I have had during our vacation. \n\nLouisiana Cochon With Cabbage, Cracklins & Pickled Peaches, $24 prior to tax- This pork dish was a little bland. But the pork was soft and tender. Wasn't a fan of the cracklins (fried pork skin) though, it was missing flavor. The pickled peach was really good and made for a sweet like relish/ salsa. Without the pickled peach, this dish would truly be a waste.\n-----------------------------\n(Total= $59.40 after tax, prior to tip)\n\nService was pretty poor by our server. It seems that this restaurant is really pushing alcohol drinks (as we saw our server tried to promote their drinks to other tables and the hostess seating us also suggested drinks with our meal). After we told our server that we were fine when asked if we wanted any drinks, she said 'so you are not going to order anything else beside water?'. I thought that was pretty rude. \n\nAnyways, when I had asked our server about the chicken andouille gumbo before ordering it, she seemed annoyed with my questions. She also seemed a little annoyed with me when I asked her about the crawfish pie too. \n\nAlthough she did take away some of our dirty dishes towards the end of the meal and also refilled our water glass once, I still thought she provided some poor service. The other employee (I would have to guess that she was equivalent of a bus boy since she only refilled our water, brought us another refill of the dinner rolls and took way the dirty dishes) helping us was very friendly and attentive. \n\nSo the 2.5 star rating that I am awarding this restaurant is for the poor and rude service and also for the bland dish we had. \n\nI wouldn't come here and would have preferred to try their Cochon Butcher around the corner instead (you can just go pass their kitchen through the restaurant).", "date": "2016-06-22 04:25:48"}

While the portion is extremely small, 3 pieces of liver on 3 pieces of bread, it was extremely delicious. The liver itself was extremely crispy, and the addition of jelly really added some flavor to it. For entree, we had the Louisiana Cochon, braised pork cheeks, and smoked pork ribs. The Louisiana Cochon was so soft and so juicy that it just melted in your mouth, and the chicharron gave the dish a little crunchiness to it. The braised pork cheeks, surprisingly, was not as soft as the Louisiana cochon, and the portion was quite small for an entree. However, the eggplant was delicious as it was grilled and flavorful. The smoked pork ribs was my favorite entree as it was the most flavorful dish we had. Very well marinated, good portion of meat, and spicy yet sweet. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place for any out-of-town visitors out there.

More of a tourist gimmick.  \nPork cheeks. Awesome dish and prepared with peas.  I don't like peas but WOW.  So good.  \nBoudin.  Best boudin I've ever eaten.  Not your traditional boudin.  More like an Italian rice ball with sausage but it is amazing.  \nRabbit and dumplings.  Very good. Very much French inspired so you must like French spices. Black pepper, thyme, fresh oregano.  So good.  \nMac and cheese.   Good but nothing special.  \nCollard greens.  Best I've ever eaten.   It's a MUST to order.   So flavorful\nBlueberry pie.  One if best desserts ever.  Not too sweet and the star was the blueberries.  Fresh and not too sweet. The entire pie was basically blueberries with the ice cream being the sweet component.  \n\nThis place remains my favorite restaurant.", "date": "2016-07-21 13:41:19"}

We asked friends and family for suggestions on where to go, eat and things to do. Cochon was provided as a must place to eat by a few people. We had a hard time deciding if we wanted to go to the restaurant or the butcher. We finally decided on the restaurant. First thing I noticed was that it was absolutely freezing inside. I understand the need for AC in a place like New Orleans but I was shivering. The shivering either stopped or I was so distracted when the food arrived. We decided to go the small plate route in order to try multiple things.  All items were delicious.  We were most excited to try the pork cheeks, and were very surprised when that quickly became our least favorite plate. Not because it was bad, but because the lobster rice, ribs and Mac n Cheese were OUT OF THIS WORLD. Im not kidding, this mac n cheese could win a world wide contest! If we were to order again right now I think we would order two orders of the ribs and a side of the mac n cheese.

They took the time to explain what our boucherie plate was composed of as well as to see if everything was to our liking. This meal is and maybe will always be in my top ten tastes. The mac and cheese was creamy with a nice crust, the alligator was wonderfully accented by the tasty garlic sauce and the boucherie plate (made up of pickled squash and carrots, head cheese, pate and other tasty things) was a great tasting experience.

This served as a wonderful side dish for our dinner.\n\nThe boneless catfish had flavors I couldn't describe, although we figured out there was a heavy helping of mint which contributed to the whole mix of spices. The pork cheeks melted in my mouth the way ice cream does, and the flavor profile had a bit of a north-african vibe to it with sultanas, finely chopped almonds, and lightly pickled zucchini bits.\n\nThe pumpkin cake was also delicious, although just a tiny tad dry.

Since it was right around the corner from our hotel, we figured it was worth a try. The restaurant smells great and is both lovely and roomy. We were seated immediately and I was given a good recommendation on Bourbon, a Jefferson Reserve with one rock. \n\nWe ordered the fried gator and the blue crab rice to start. The rice was very tasty with a good balance of crab and the seasoning was enhancing rather than flavoring. \nThe fried gator was like a wet dream that buffalo popcorn chicken has.  Great flavor and perfectly cooked. \n\nI ordered the Cochon which is served over cabbage with the fried pork rinds.  Initially I was not impressed until I started getting these perfect bites of pork that melted in my mouth with a bark that added just the right chewy crunchy feel, balanced against the cabbage as well as pickled turnips. The turnips weren't particularly great but everything else was.\n\nMy companion had the short ribs. The waiter discouraged the folks next to us from having them which I consider a disservice as it was the best short ribs I have had. Smiley with a perfect bark, legitimately melt in your mouth. If it doesn't melt in your mouth then slow down.  She kept closing her eyes. The accompanying potato salad was modest and just right.  \n\nWe had to ignore the desserts for our own safety but they looked great. \n\nService was very good.

Also, there's something home-y and familiar about all the dishes here. \n\nCame here for both lunch & dinner - menu is the same for both meals.\n\nMUST ORDERS: \n*Wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter: Everything is amazing with butter and oysters are no exception. I like this better than other chargrilled oysters in town (other restaurants make it almost like oysters rockefeller) \n*Smoke Ham Hock with Pinto Beans, Apples, Sage & Jalapeno Buttermilk: Fall. Off. The. Bone. The smokiness in the ham hock was so beautifully developed. I also appreciated that the pinto beans were very flavorful and complex (vs. typical one-note bean taste)\n*Fried Livers with Pepper Jelly & toast: I'm not an innards person but the pepper jelly really helped to balance out the liver. It leans a little on the sweet side from the jelly but I surprisingly liked it. \n*Mushroom Salad with Deep Fried Beef Jerky & Lemon Vinaigrette: Not a leafy green in sight - just a beautiful pile of mushroom. So, if you're a mushroom fan, recommended! \n\nNICE TO TRY: \n*Fried Alligator with Chili Garlic Mayo: This oddly reminds me of orange chicken - bold, tangy flavor - but with alligator. When I've had alligator in the past, it was really gamey and tough. This really tasted just like chicken! \n*Smoked Pork Ribs: SO flavorful and the heat definitely builds. I prefer my ribs less saucey but it was still a solid dish \n*Cucumbers & Herbs in Vinegar: This is only a nice to try because this is pretty popular in asian cuisine. Cochon does this dish justice though! If you want something light and refreshing, it's fantastic! \n\nThere are no \"eh skip it\" on my list.

But I can't judge a place based on those two factors, they are minute points after you consider the food.  So what do I say about the food - some creativeness here but nothing out of the ordinary that I was amazed about.  The wood-fire chargrilled oysters, they were good but not the tastiest oysters I had this trip.  The chili garlic butter was good but it lacked the kick I wanted on the oysters and the oysters themselves were small.  The fried liver with pepper jelly and toast was probably my favorite dish this meal - it was unique with unique flavors and the combination went very well together.  We also had the fried alligator with chili garlic mayo and it tastes exactly like it sounds. Nothing dramatic, just good, not spectacular.  The fried boudin was rich and good flavors - also lacked the kick and mediocre at best.  We also got the mushroom salad with deep fried beef jerky and a lemon vinaigrette.  Good flavors and unique as well.  And we couldn't go to a place called cochon and not try something with pig so we opted for the smoked ham hock with pinto beans, apple, sage, and jalapeno buttermilk.  The ham hock was smokey and fell off the bone, however it was a little salty and I didn't feel like there were any flavors infused into it but the smoke.  Unimpressed with cochon and thought the whole experience was just A-Ok.. Wouldn't crave this place or go back again..", "date": "2016-11-03 21:05:31"}

It's rare to find the dining experience that is worth an hour or more wait. That said, I didn't plan ahead for dinner on a recent road trip through New Orleans and I found myself facing an hour wait to be seated at Cochon. C'est la vie. \n\nTo pass the time my girlfriend and I grabbed some drinks: one round at the Cochon bar and another at nearby Barrel Proof. After just over an hour had passed, we found ourself back at Cochon with promises that our table would be ready any moment. Okay. 15 minutes passed and we still hadn't been seated, so I again asked the hostess for an update to be told that \"there are tables being cleaned off right now.\" Umm, okay, fine. Another 15 minutes passed, bringing our total wait time to 1 hour 40 minutes, before we were finally given table and then only after I again asked the hostess for an update. Ugh! We were then seated only to find multiple empty tables. Moreover they sat us, two people, at a table for four when there was an empty table for two next to it. Huh?! Were we waiting for no reason? Were they just mismanaging their table situation? Or did we get bumped down the list earlier? In any case it seems like unacceptable service. Don't quote a wait time of 1 hour and then have someone waiting for 1 hour 40 minutes.\n\nSo why am I still giving this place 4 stars? Because the food was just that impressive. From the Wood Fired Oysters with Chili Garlic Butter to the Catfish Courtbouillon to the absolutely amazing Rabbit and Dumplings, everything was prepared to perfection. The beautiful decor with its exposed brick, cool background music selection, and the pleasantness of our actual server also helped mitigate the horrible experience with the hostess. So, yes, do yourself a favor and add Cochon to your list of restaurants to try, but make sure you secure a reservation or be prepared to face waiting hell.", "date": "2016-12-31 18:04:42"}

I order the ribs, twice baked potato and pickled cucumbers. The ribs were good. Nice smoky taste with a pickled watermelon rind on top. Amazing. The twice baked potato had a great taste. While I'm on my last rib, the star of the night Becca, came over with some towels she heated up for me to clean my hands. When our meals arrived there was an entree missing.  The manager came over about 10 minutes announcing this dish is on me. As a former server i was always told \"bad news travels more than good news.\" Nice call! While my mom was eating Becca brought a knife over saying \"I noticed you didn't have one.\" If that's not customer service I don't know what is.  The fish was cooked just right still juicy and very fresh. The shrimp and eggplant had a taste similar to stuffing. Great for those that don't like their veggies.

I started off with the popular Fried Alligator with Chili Garlic Mayonnaise. It was a fried alligator bites mixed with the mayonnaise and accompanied with mint leaves. I loved how the batter didn't become soggy even dressed with the mayonnaise. It was my first time trying alligator so it did have this fish/chicken-like texture. Also, it was a little chewy. Don't know if that's the case with all alligator but I'll have to try another alligator dish to compare.\n\nNext were the Fried Boudin with Pickled Peppers. They were fried to golden crispy deliciousness. You could taste the rice, the pork, and the veggies. It was sublime dipped with the mustard and the peppers cleansed the palate from all that richness.\n\nThe entree I chose was the Louisiana Cochon with Cabbage, Cracklins, and Pickled Peaches. I thought the meat was nice and juicy but the sauce was a little salty for my taste. The cracklins were like pork potato chips. Excellent. \n\nI wasn't planning to get dessert but my awesome server convinced me otherwise. The Chocolate Hazelnut Pudding seemed like something that wouldn't take too much space in my stomach. I liked it and it seemed like a satisfying Nutella-style pudding. \n\nThere were a few subtle misses but overall the experience was great at Cochon. \n\nOverall: 4.5 stars", "date": "2017-01-20 05:39:57"}

The food here is amazing.\n\nMy wife & I shared 1 appetizer :  the wood fire oyster and it was so tasty and amazing that my wife ate 4 of them and I only ate 1.  We also shared the Cochon signature dish which have soft pork as the center piece and some cabbage on a nice source underneath the pork and mix in with some really crispy & crunchy octopus (I think) .  Also we shared their special of the day which was a burger.  This is so different from any burger I had at 5 guys or shake shack.  The meat was moist and so much favor.  You have to try it as I cannot really do it justice with words.\n\nI was so full but since the appetizer , entrees was so amazing , I had to order a dessert to try. Since I love the banana pudding at Tao in NYC, I wanted to get the banana pudding here as  a comparison and Cochon's version blew Tao's version away.  It was so beautiful and so warm and tasty that even my wife who is not a big fan of pudding cannot stop.\n\nI also tried the barley & south perish beer and it was really good and washed all the food down in a really satisfying way.\n\nThe food itself already justify its 5 stars.

The crispy casing, to the blend of their pork and rice sausage was so delicious. I've tried boudin balls at other Cajun restaurants and they didn't amount to these ones since the others were bland, but this one just tasted so right. My favorite thing on this menu are the smoked pork ribs. The meat was fall of the bone, oh so tender, and the flavor was perfect with the right mix of spice & rub, and then topped with a watermelon pickle. Loved this dish so much, I wish I could've gotten a second round. As a side, the mac & cheese casserole was a nice add to the table.\n\nLocated outside the popular French Quarter, this restaurant is worth making a trip for.

A 20 minute walk from the French quarter will take you by Harrods's ($50 on black?) and Emeril's New Orleans (if you win on black). Not great for big groups, but intimate and super friendly (typical southern hospitality)!  Portions are on the smaller side but each is unique (not all are easily shareable).  Everything we had was great; fried alligator, rabbit,  dumplings, oysters, braised pork cheeks, grits, cheesecake,\n\nRecommendation: gnarly barley radical rye p.a + fried alligator + rabbit & dumplings + bourbon flight + the Cuba cigar that you smuggled through customs (if only....;)", "date": "2017-03-06 02:47:09"}

In the past it's made me feel comfortable, relaxed and glad I was in town. Best of all the food is always very very good.  It's been a while since I've visited and in that time they have expanded the restaurant considerably. I'm not sure on size but to me the warehouse expansion seems more than double the footprint from the original restaurant - this isn't scientific though so I could be wrong. \n\nAt any rate, my experience this last weekend was pretty disappointing. It's too bad too because the food is awesome still. Don't get me started of the tastiness of the fried alligator or wood fired oysters. It seems to me that through expanding so large they've lost a lot the magic of what they used to be and now the place is a money maker. The warehouse is too loud, dark and most of all COLD. So cold that every waitress/waiter were wearing hoodies and a few tables around us had to ask that they turn on the heat. You have to understand if you haven't gone that this is polar opposite of how you'd feel if you went to the old Cochon. Don't get me wrong, accidents happen and as soon as a few tables asked about the heat they took care of it but should multiple tables need to ask? I guess this was a taste of how service has changed here because it didn't stop there. \n\nThe overall menu doesn't change too much, a few things here and there but that's totally fine as it's beyond tasty. However, when you go out of the way to clip a specials menu to the main menu you'd think there would be some explanation. Tri-tip reads interesting but at $80 seems pricey. On my way out I saw one in the pass and it was clearly a family style serving. I might have been interested in that or the goat neck had I known this. I also don't think it's appropriate after serving drinks to immediate ask if we're ready to order entrees, then ask every.. single.. time... you return to the table after if we are ready to order entrees. I'm all for trying to turn a table but I think a Beard level establishment should do it in a subtle way that the guests don't feel like they're being pushed out. Never would have experienced this at the old Cochon. \n\nIt's weird, I'm more sad about this recent visit than pissed or whatever. I feel like this is a breakup or something. We've just grown apart. I just don't understand the need to totally change the mojo of a place just to make more money. Gold digging girls driving me crazy I can't take it no mo.", "date": "2017-03-06 20:17:36"}

This was a solid choice to kick off our visit and first meal there. 'Cochon' is French for 'pig', and what an aptly named restaurant because we sure waddled out of there!\n\nFOOD (4.5 stars):\n------------------\nEverything was outstanding, even beginning with our first choice of the **wood-fired oysters with chili butter**. The sauce was perfect with just a mild kick to it, and the oysters were meaty but not chewy. \n\nFrom the boucherie, we went for the **pork cheek country captain with raisins, turnips, & almonds** which had a unique flavor and were deliciously tender.\n\nBecause of the namesake, we had to order the **louisiana cochon with cabbage, cracklins, & pickled turnips**. Now, the South is big on their cracklins and turnips, so expect to see them on many dishes. That pig sure was juicy and enjoyable.\n\nFor sides, we got the **macaroni & cheese casserole** and **smothered greens**. The mac & cheese was cooked perfectly! And any southern meal could always use some greens.\n\nSERVICE (3 stars):\n-------------------\nTo our great surprise and disappointment, our server was strangely cold. Not the warm Southern hospitality we were expecting. Maybe because it was during Mardi Gras week and everyone is just exhausted during that time, but still. It put a damper on our festive mood. Also we noticed that the busboys and other tables' servers were super friendly and greeted us warmly, so I don't know why our server couldn't put on a smile. Don't you know that bigger smiles = bigger tips?\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR (4 stars):\n-----------------------------\nWe appreciated the open airy feeling of the interior due to the wood paneling. It's nice to dine in a space that is light and not claustrophobic. The vibe is very warm and is conducive to socializing. Great group spot!\n\nTIP: Make reservations during Mardi Gras week! We didn't know any better, but we got really lucky on timing. \n\nDATE TIP: You and your Cochon companion might feel stuffed on the way out.

We watched a clip on Eater, and since my babe loves all things barbecue, we wanted to drop in for a meal. Surprisingly, we ended up eating everything BUT the pork entree which people raved about on Eater. \n\nThe space is awesome, with a handful of tables outdoors, and an excellent bar stocked with a vast array of Bourbon. My babe ordered a $30 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (Stagg) Bourbon which he said was really hard to find. He took a lot of pleasure in sniffing and sipping upon it. Me? Well, I'm a cheap date. I ordered an old fashioned with Rye whiskey. I chose the Michter's which was only a $13 cocktail. Still, it was our last night, and we wanted to have an indulgent send-off.\n\nWe put our names down for a table, and the wait was 45 minutes, but the bar has open seating. So, we ended up timing it perfectly when a couple vacated two spots for us at the bar. We opted to stay at the bar because it was lively, and gave our table away.\n\nWe started with the fried Boudin, and it was excellent. The Dijon mustard and pickled onions were perfect accompaniments. I also wanted to try the shrimp and deviled egg jambalaya. I had jambalaya the night before from Oceana, but it didn't not hit the spot, and it definitely was not spicy. Thankfully, Cochon's was expertly rendered because it had a heat that was subtle but present.  \nIt also had the signature dark roux which to me signals authentic Cajun flavorings. The deviled egg actually worked to quell some of the spice. \n\nMeanwhile, I ogled a fish dish that someone else nearby was eating. I asked her if it was good, and she couldn't say enough nice things about it, so I literally ordered the same meal as her, even down to the macaroni and cheese side dish that she had chosen. This method worked out. I'm usually hesitant to order a whole fish, skin-on, but this one was blackened and cooked perfectly and didn't have a single stray bone left behind. It was delicious, and I ate the whole thing like a #champ. \n\nThe mac and cheese is next level, but it also filled me up. Like so much so that it was both my side dish and my dessert. Haha.\n\nMy sweetheart had the rabbit stew, and every bite I stole was impressive. They use biscuits for dumplings, the broth is thicker like a gravy, and the meat was plentiful and tasty and very tender.\n\nAll-in-all, we had a great night at Cochon. Many thanks to the expert bartenders who were also our servers. We appreciated his knowledgeable and talented they were. I also love supporting a local business that is trying to be both Cajun and Southern because these two genres make for an excellent hybrid.", "date": "2017-03-18 21:29:18"}

I went in expecting a fine dining experience, when really this is more of a contemporary fusion of local cajun/creole, BBQ, gastropub, etc. like I said, a bit confused on exactly what that wanted to be. Had the food and service all been amazing, this would have quickly faded to \"no big deal;\" but, not to be. \n\nWe had early 5:3.. Hostess was pleasant and reserved  table was ready when we arrived. A nice detail. But service went downhill from there. We could hear about half of what our waiter was saying and he was constantly referring to his order book for details on the day's specials which he had not yet memorized\n\nWe got our cocktail orders in and I was excited to take a dive into the local cuisine. We ordered  gator bites and roasted oysters with hot chili oil. Man, these local oysters are huge! I usually eat my oysters raw and haven' had gator in over 30 years; so not being an expert, I can't really compare or contrast; but would say they were very good; but amazing or memorable. After dropping off the apps, we were told the bread for the table was still not ready in the kitchen. \n\nFor the main course, I had the beef brisket and my wife the Cachon (Pulled pork shoulder shaped  into a patty and seasoned on the outside with a spicy dry rub). Oddly though, as our waiter was taking his now 2nd smoke break just outside the door by our table, they brought our main course plates while we  were still halfway through our appetizers and cocktails. The asst manager apologized for the timing but just left it at that. No wine orders were taken and, why? We still had half our cocktails left. The overwhelming flavor on the brisket was salt.  Really not much more of interest beyond that. And, oddly, served only with a cold and average potato salad. The Cachon was surprisingly dry which is not what I expect from pork shoulder; but maybe that is how Cachon is supposed to be. Our bread arrived about  1/2 way into the main course.  Odd for sure, but, must say, possibly worth the wait?!\n\nNever did get a wine order in as the timing was just not right, but did order dessert. The German chocolate cake we shared was amazing! Maybe the best I have ever had. Unfortunately, they didn't take a coffee order at the time and by the time I could  put it in, I did not get it until \u00be of the way through the cake. And, when they did bring it, they forgot the sugar. He never did come back with it and I asked them to take the coffee off of my tab. \n\nOverall, with so many great restaurant choices in NOLA, I'm not sure this makes the \"must\" or even \"should\" list for me.", "date": "2017-03-27 16:42:01"}

We made a reservation a day or two before for 8:30pm and actually tried to come earlier since we had some extra time but weren't able to be seated until the reserved time. Not a big deal since there was a bar across the street we waited at.\n\nThe food and drinks at Cochon perfectly matched our palette - bold flavors, depth, unique combinations. We got quite a few things but here were the memorable moments:\n\n- Wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter ($14) - we fell in love with wood-fired oysters at Felix's the night before so we wanted to see how Cochon did theirs. These were great as well, with some Asian flare and sweetness - but I think we all preferred Felix's simple, indulgent, charred-forward flavor.\n\n- Rabbit & dumplings ($23) - Cochon's take on Chicken & Dumplings, and this was a favorite of our table. It tasted so homey and comforting, like it had been stewing for hours. I couldn't get enough of this.\n\n- Shrimp & deviled egg gumbo ($8) - Loved this take on gumbo, because it felt nostalgic to our Chinese heritage with there being notes of fermented shrimp paste. It just added a lot of depth and umami.\n\nI can't remember the name of the cocktail I had, but it was so good that I had probably 5 of them. It had passion fruit, which I love and was probably reminiscent of a hurricane and maybe had mezcal. But if you want a perfect drink on a hot day, keep ordering the drink that has passion fruit.\n\nHuge Plus: the bathrooms have amazing acoustics.

I didn't try the alligator but it looked good. \n\nEntrees: Three of us had the Catfish Courtbuillon, one person had the Rabbit and Dumplings, and another had the Louisiana Cochon. The Courtbouillons were extremely salty. Two of us tried to muster through because the flavor of the dish was amazing but the salt was very overpowering. A lady came around, like seriously I have no idea where she came from, and asked me how the dish was. I said mine was too salty, actually all of us did, but one of us had already powered through the dish and two of us sent it back (the woman first offered to correct it with out us even asking to send it back) as the lady assured us they would fix it. First, the remake came out super fast. Impressive. Still a smidge salty but less salty than the first and much more tolerable. The dish is really good but be mindful of the salt. The catfish was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Somewhere the broth seems if the put a extra pinch of salt in the dish it consume the flavor with salt. To the managers credit, hence the four stars, she explained they were training new cooks and it was very possible that someone was unknowingly heavy handed with the salt. I mean, I am one for transparency and flaw acceptance, it could save the world alot of turmoil if more people did it, lol.

Don't waste your money. You're in Nola, there are so many better options.", "date": "2017-04-09 14:15:36"}

Feels upscale but relaxed and well worth checking out if you're in the area. I don't know if this is really quintessential Cajun cuisine but it was pretty delicious. More like 4.25 or 4.5 stars than  4.\n\n\nThe Long Version \n\nI came here during Mardi Gras with a group of friends and this place was well reviewed and close to our living accommodations. The night before I went to their Butcher shop right next door and it blew me away (read the review on that to hear more high praise or just stop reading and go!). \n\nWhen we arrived the place was pretty full but we were able to quickly get a table outside and the weather was beautiful although still hot. The service was great, we were given waters quickly and I started off with an Arnold Palmer which looked better than it tasted. For starters we went with hush puppies and fried gator tail which came out relatively quick and tasted pretty great. There was a bit too much sauce on the tail for my liking but other than that - no complaints.\n\nFor my main I went with the ribs and they were pretty good. They weren't fall off the bone sadly but the flavor profile was outstanding, I'd recommended them no problem. The portion size was pretty healthy too and could easily be shared with one other along with a side. \n\nSpeaking of sides, the Mac and Cheese is not to be missed. I ordered some at the butcher shop the night before and again here. Usually I'm not very big on Mac and Cheese but this one was unreal. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the cheese didn't make me feel overly full with every bite (well not at first, it is hot cheese and carbs after all). Every bite I took was phenomenal and I can confidently say it was the best take on the dish I've had in my life and that includes the attempts with truffle (Why Steakhouses? Truffles or their oils don't make everything better). I even ended up leaving some ribs on the plate to finish the Mac and Cheese, it was that good. Long story short, get the Mac and Cheese - you won't regret it.\n\nOverall this place was great, not perfect (aside from the Mac and Cheese which is a gift from the Gods), but I'd come back here. The atmosphere, service, and food make this place worth a stop. If you're with a group, try to split dishes as they are big and heavy. I was a hungover gluttonous fool and ordered/horded too much... Opps...", "date": "2017-04-09 18:19:41"}

This place was recommended seemingly everywhere -- other people I knew who'd visited NOLA, articles, and so on -- so I was super excited to check it out on a recent visit to NOLA.\n\nI made a reservation about a week in advance for 9:15pm.  We arrived a bit early and it was busy, so we weren't able to be seated until a little after 9:15 (which was a bit of a struggle as we were approaching hangry by this point in the night, but understandable!).  \n\nThe space is surprisingly large inside, with ample seating in the main area and upstairs.  The restaurant has a modern, upscale-ish/trendy sort of feel.  Service was great.\n\nThe highlight was, of course, the food!  Standout items were the crawfish pie, which was basically like a big empanada full of crawfish and other delicious things and had a great flavor; the boudin balls; the macaroni and cheese (which was almost impossibly creamy and flavorful, so good!  A must-try!) and the banana pudding dessert, which packed a TON of flavor and had warm cookies/cake/something amazing mixed in with the pudding.  I had the Catfish Courtbuillon for my entree, which was delicious and flavorful (and a welcome lighter alternative to some of the more rich food we had ordered) as well.\n\nPrices were pretty reasonable given the trendiness of the atmosphere and the reputation of the place -- for 1 drink, 2 appetizers, 3 entrees and a dessert shared among 3 people we came in at about $40/pp.", "date": "2017-04-10 02:15:04"}

This Cajun/Creole oasis on Tchoupitoulas Street is absolute heaven for anyone who knows anything about food, or just likes to taste things that are yummy. It does not deserve anything less than 5 stars, and I'd give it 6 if I could. I guarantee you that my descriptions don't do justice to the orgasmic eating experience that is Cochon.\n\nThe bar is very classy and serves a variety of cocktails in addition to their beers on tap, in cans and bottles, and a great wine selection. The ambiance is exactly what you're looking for no matter what you're looking for. It's classy without being stuffy and casual at the same time without being divey. I don't really have a word that quite encompasses the feel except for perfect.\n\nAll of that aside, you're here for the FOOD, so let's get to it.\n\nWood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter ($14) - undeniably the best $14 you'll ever spend. I had a ton of wood-fired oysters on my trip and none even held a candle to holding a candle to these. They are perfectly cooked and swimming in this chili garlic butter that I want all of my food to be drenched in for the rest of eternity\n\nFried alligator with chili garlic mayonnaise ($12) - this is the one thing that might be better than the oysters. They're crispy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside..perfectly fried in all the right ways. I'm a huge fan of all aiolis/mayonnaises, and this is one of the best I've ever had. They pair perfectly together and throw a veritable party in your mouth. I don't mean a high-school kegger in your friends backyard, I mean the parties people who win the Oscars go to after dropping off their gold statues.\n\nSmoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad ($29) - wow was this perfectly done. My mouth is watering just thinking about this and I just knocked back 4 bowls of cereal (don't ask). This is how brisket should take. I don't know how long they smoked it for, but they nailed it. You didn't need a knife to cut the brisket, it practically fell apart as the juices oozed out elegantly onto my plate and subsequently onto my lap (through no fault of the waiter's or restaurant's, it was all on me). The potato salad was a perfect pair and I'd highly recommend you try one of my patented \"perfect bites\" which is when you get a little bit of everything on you fork and devour accordingly.\n\nSeriously, I could write a book on this place because I have volumes to say about every dish and the 4 of us ate quite a bit of food. I would fly back to New Orleans just to eat here and then leave. Seriously. Hmm maybe I will. Let's check Travelocity.", "date": "2017-04-10 20:52:00"}

For entrees, we had the rabbit dumplings and fried oyster sandwich. Both stellar but the oyster sandwich was sooooo flavorful. A little heavy on the sauces but def the most memorable of our experience at Cochon.\n\nWe didn't mind, but some might have been seriously turned off by how long the process took.

Cochon has a trendy atmosphere with minimalist industrial decor that has become very popular within the last few years. The bartender, Wyatt, is fantastic and truly great at making drinks and feeling out how much he should talk to his customers. He gave terrific recommendations on beer and food.\n\nI had the alligator small plate to start. I have had alligator tail several times, but this was a different cut that was much better. The spicy aoli was amazing and the meat was very tender. I had the Louisiana Cochon as my entree because when in Cochon, eat Cochon. It was the most well seasoned and delicious meat I have had in a long time, and they some how managed to elevate cabbage to a hole new level. Pork crackling added great texture as well. Awesome-sauce. I was going to stop, but I couldn't so I ordered dessert. I had the spicy peanut chocolate pudding pie, which was as good as it sounds. Perfect finish to a terrific meal. \n\nThe great part is that I didn't even mean to eat at Cochon! Serendipitously, I ended up here after a long search for Cochon 'Butcher' that took me on a long trek through the streets. After Google Maps failed me once, I ended up at Cochon, but not the butcher side that was next door. I was in the mood for a muffaletta, but decided to stay since the butcher closed in 15min and I had already ordered a drink. A little pricey, but worth it.

Unfortunately, you can tell the restaurant is trying to turn people around quickly. I get that, but it ruins the experience when a host is walking about and noting your progress on an iPad every five minutes. That's not an exaggeration. I think it's part of the restaurant's training because we also went to Pesce where they did the same. I get that you have to do it, but at least practice some subtlety.\n\nOk, the food. We started with the oysters. I'm from New England where they pride themselves on their oysters and I have to say NOLA has New England beat if you like meatier oysters. I didn't even know people grilled them because I'm just used to shuckin' and slurpin'! We ordered the crawfish empanada because we wanted to try crawfish in New Orleans. It was good, but I wouldn't order it again and we didn't finish it.\n\nWe also ordered the boudin, which reviews recommended and they were definitely right. When you google boudin, it looks like an uncooked sausage so we were a bit skeptical, but that's not at all what they brought out. The fried ball of meat was delicious and I highly recommend it to anyone going.\n\nNext up were the ribs. The meat fell right off the bone and had a complex mix of spices that I really enjoyed. My wife found it to be rather spicy so if you're not into spice, you should probably shy away from this dish. Last, but most certainly not least was the mac and cheese. We ordered it hoping for the pancetta mac and cheese at the Cochon Butcher, but pancetta wasn't on the menu. The mac and cheese was still a very satisfying side dish. It was well portioned with a perfect balance of cheese and cream.\n\nOverall it was good, but we probably wouldn't go back.

I didn't want to eat both the potato salad and the mac n cheese, but all the reviews said the mac and cheese was legit, so I ordered that too. The oysters came out, and I will concur with EVERYONE that said they were amazing. They really were great. Our entrees came out shortly after we finished the oysters. I was initially pleasantly surprised by how soft the brisket was when I went to cut it up. HOWEVER...I soon realized that there was a lot of fat in the brisket. I know...I know. Fat?! On brisket?!?! No sh*t! I eat A LOT of brisket, so I know the routine...I know the deal. This was an inordinate amount of fatty brisket, but like the fat kid that I am, I ate it all anyway. I was starving.  (My sister and I drove from Atlanta today and i'd only eaten a breakfast sandwich at Dunkin Donuts and some Haribo gummy bears all day!). The horseradish potato salad was really good though! Next up was my mac and cheese, and it was ok. VERY VERY ok. Even though i was full after eating my fat boy brisket, if the mac and cheese had been great, I would've eaten every bite of it. I had about 5 bites and then threw in the towel. My sister let me taste a bit of her catfish and it wasn't bad. It was slightly above VERY ok, but slightly below good. I could taste the salt in it, which isn't difficult for me since I rarely cook with salt or eat salty foods, but I think it was what an average would consider the right amount of salt. \n\nAnyway...I'd actually come back.

Cochon had 8 local beers on tap ranging from $7-9 per pint. I had the Strawberry Canebrake from Parish Brewing which was a fabulous Louisiana beer with generous hits of strawberry - solid fruity beer for the hot NOLA weather and very sessionable at 5%.\n\nWe had the:\nWood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter $14 - I'm allergic to shellfish but my dining partner said this was bomb!\nPork cheek country captain with raisins, turnips & almonds $12 - Such a pretty dish but tasty to boot! The combination of all the ingredients gave it such good balance between flavors and textures.\nMacaroni & cheese casserole $7 - Creamy, southern style mac & cheese that came in a generous portion.\nSmothered greens $7 - Neither of us loved this dish and I would definitely skip it on my next go around at Cochon.\nFried boudin with pickled peppers $9 - Deep fried goodness filled with everything nice! A slight kick to them but in a very good way.\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience though it didn't knock my socks off. Solid food & beer, excellent service and very accommodating to us.

YO! MAMA! GOOD!\n\n     I recently had the privilege to travel through NOLA for about a week. The prime reason for the destination outside of Jazz Fest was food. We had reservations booked at all the big ones (Commanders Palace, Brennans for brunch, Irenes, Mr. B's) among others. The food was amazing everywhere, but my wife and I discussed our favorite places the other day, and mine was without a doubt cochon. \n     For starters, the smell of the building alone is BBQ heaven. It smells like oak wood, smoke and meat. Ahhhhh just thinking about the smell now is putting me on cloud 9. As a group, we started off with the crawfish pie, wood-fired oysters, cucumbers and herbs in vinegar and the mac and cheese. My personal favorite was the oysters. I don't know if I've had tastier grilled oysters anywhere... and damn I do love me some oysters. The crawfish pie was also amazing and unlike anything I've ever had. We order 2 for a table of 6 and we could have easily ordered 2 more. The cucumbers and herbs were simple and refreshing. The mac and cheese was lethal. I urge you not to order and eat it before your main course or you may find yourself full and unable to eat more. I didn't have that problem but some of party did. It is damn good. Creamy cheesy heaven. \n     I went with the pork cheeks for my main course. It was simple and rustic but incredibly complex at the same time. The flavors were amazing and the pork cheek melted in your mouth. The rest of our table tried the rabbit and dumplings, 3 order of cochon with cabbage and one order of the brisket. We were all incredibly satisfied. We are a loud group and aside from silverware scraping plates and peoples lips smacking there wasn't a lot of other noise or talking. The Food was amazing and the atmosphere only added to it. I enjoyed all of the food in NOLA, but Cochon, ya'll stole my heart!\n\n#flavortrain approved and 2 hands on the belly", "date": "2017-06-07 20:00:52"}

Every part of our experience was truly worthy of five stars.\n\nWe arrived on a Thursday night without reservations and found that the wait would be about 45 minutes, but the hostesses were extremely kind to fit us in and recommended we go to Butcher (still part of Cochon but more casual, two doors down from the restaurant) for small bites and drinks while we waited. It was a great suggestion that we followed before returning when we received a text that we could be seated. \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is warm and modern. It's a welcome change from the busyness of the town. The menu is small but  works in their favor, because the food was unforgettable! We tried several thing from the menu, but our favorites were the grilled oysters (so good we got two plates), the pork cheek (so tender and flavorful), the mac and cheese (rich and creamy), the red fish (huge portion), and the collard greens (perfectly cooked). Our waitress Colleen was especially helpful to our group and made sure our experience was superb. \n\nOne of the best parts of traveling to New Orleans is the incredible food, and Cochon exceeded my expectations.

This was late lunch and my companion and I were hungry.  This was not my first experience at Cochon.  I already knew the food was delicious and practically everything is made by hand.   But this time I was hit with a huge lunch bill - 1 appetizer, two plates and dessert = $100+ dollars and two people who left hungry.  We should have not had to go out to dinner that night.... that late lunch should have lasted and we only required a few tapas to get us through.  Not this time.  We left Cochon hungry.  That's why we had dessert at Lunch because the portions for our meat plate and signature dish were small.  The crackling in my plate was soggy, but the desserts we fantastic - my pineapple upside-down cake was great, but again not large enough to fill my tummy.  The appetizer was $15 for 5 char-grilled oysters in garlic and chilli oil.  Only two of the oysters were decent size, the rest were tiny.  We only drank water, no booze.\n\nWe're not fat, grotesque, nor are we gluttons.  We expect to eat a meal and leave satisfied.  \nMy companion and I did not feel that way after our departure.\n\nStaff was nice but constantly walking around to empty plates saying \"that must have been so good, that plate is clean.\"  The plate was clean because there was hardly enough on it to start to fill us up.  And we later started looking around at tables who got bread before the meal and realized we never got bread or anything for the table before our meal. Staff left no room for criticism.  Multiple waiters bragged about the food to us and left no room for us to say \"we're still hungry.\"  \n\nFor the fine flavors, I'm willing to give this place another chance.  For the tiny portions on main course meals (not just \"small plates\") - shame on you.  I'll wait for someone else to offer to pay for the next meal and try again.", "date": "2017-06-18 15:33:02"}

The popcorn alligator was just average; not much in the way of creative seasonings.  The texture was good, the coating was light and crisp and the drizzled sauce is what gave it a nice kick of flavor.  It was good enough to eat it all, but nothing to write home about.  The fried oyster and bacon sandwich was extremely delicious.  The sourdough bread was fresh and grilled to crunchy perfection.  The sandwich was filled with lightly fried oysters, bacon, lettuce, tomato and other goodness, including  a nice, tangy aioli sauce.  Unique, awesome BLOT (bacon, lettuce, oyster, tomato)!!  I opted for the mac-n-cheese, because it was raining outside and the mac-n-cheese photos looked so comforting...and it was indeed comforting, with a modern twist.  Tasted like a good amount of roasted garlic included in the bechamel sauce, along with a touch of cayenne and baked to a succulent internal creamy consistency, and browned on top to give a slight crunch. \nThis is one of those places where there are so many uniquely prepared dishes that you want to return several times to try different things.

The second time I went back as my wife wanted to try the food based on the reviews. They asked if we had a reservation, we did not, they told us the wait was 30 minutes. At almost 30 min we were seated at the back, we saw approximately 15 tables available along with an upstairs totally unoccupied. I guess they were trying to create a waiting line for people passing by. Our server was rude and inattentive. She failed or made it seem too difficult to explain the items on the menu when asked. The ham hook was not bad but was dry. The mac & cheese was good. My wife indicated the shrimp was a 3 out of 5. Not sure if I will return due to their poor service.", "date": "2017-06-28 23:41:32"}

We stopped here on our first night in New Orleans as it was walking distance from our hotel room. I love the location in the Industrial/Warehouse/Arts District with all the old-world New Orleans charm and character. There are many wonderful museums in the area too, including the WWII Museum. \n\nHeading up the kitchen is the highly decorated chef, Donald Link, who brings Cajun comforts and house-cured artisan pork and meats to the denizens and visitors of New Orleans. While the menu is pork-focused there is a nice selection of salads, fish, shrimp and oysters to feast upon. \n\nI had my first foray into fried alligator here at Cochon. As the saying goes, the alligator to me \"tasted just like chicken,\" except it was quite a bit chewier. I must say it was much better than I anticipated and fun to experience but it wasn't something I would need to order again. The chili garlic mayonnaise helped moisten the meat and lend a nice fiery flavor. \n\nThe Louisiana Cochon (French for pig) dish was really something else. This one was a real crowd pleaser. The flavors complement each other perfectly. The meat is so fall-apart tender and the addition of the turnips, cabbage, cracklins and pickled peach just made the pork all that more enticing. The cochon was one of the standout dishes on my trip...the ultimate comfort food! \n\nWe didn't like the Shrimp & Eggplant Dressing. We thought this one would be a showstopper because my dining partner loves eggplant, shrimp and dressing. It was really mushy and lackluster and didn't excite either of us. I focused on the Macaroni 'n Cheese Casserole which was ultra rich withl the right mix of cheese, cream and butter. Normally I would finish all the mac but there was so much food I didn't stand a chance, plus I wanted to make it to my first day of training the next day lol. \n\nWe definitely had a great time at Cochon. This is the perfect place to nosh and drink authentic tantilzing New Orleans food in a lively rustic setting. Head next door to Cochon's spinoff, Cochon Butcher, for a hearty handcrafted sandwich, cheese plate, deli meats and some wine or beer.", "date": "2017-07-05 22:23:20"}

On return we were excited about being sat right away,  less exciting was the hipster waiter who was clearly less than amused to wait on us.  He tried on friendly for size while answering our menu questions but realized it just didn't fit when we asked if he could bring bread to the table..... smug would be putting it mildly. \n\nWe shrugged it off, it was a busy weekend so.... whatever!  Drinks always lighten the mood and ours were damn tasty, our  waiter sucks but the 'porch swings' were a hit! We placed our order with little help from the hipster but again... the drinks ... \n\nSo, when I felt wings a fluttering under the table and jumped from my seat with Holy Ghost gusto.......there was a huge Cockroach beating a hasty retreat;  our waiters' , hell, the entire establishments nonplussed reaction was disheartening and ... honestly,  suspect! \n\nSuspect because no one moved, no one responded, no one  reacted;  I was seated at a table so close to the food prep station that to miss the commotion would be a dereliction of duty of both the front and back of the house.  \n\nMy waiter, in the immediate moments following my ankles molestation by the hissing cockroach, DID NOTHING!! He scampered away as quickly as his freeloading friend la CockaRoacha.  \n\nAt no point did our waiter offer up empathy nor sympathy for what was happening to a guest at their establishment. I sat there for several seconds expecting a member of management to provide me with the usual song and dance that comes subsequent to episodes of horror in business such as this.  My background in corporate salon management taught me to perform that song and dance with Motown efficiency...this team could use some Berry Gordy training because they dropped the Mic on this ... big time.. and not in a good way!\n\nUnfortunately an apology never escaped the lips of my waiter... WHY? Are roaches such a regular occurrence in this place that they don't register a reaction or was I a deplorable... as an African-American female.... the wrong demographic??\n\n\nIt took an eternity for management to acknowledge the incident even as they witnessed it happening and immediately removed the traveler's carcass from the dining room floor.  \n\nWhen the 'official' apology finally did come, it came in the form of 'I've been here for three years and this has never happened before' not 'I'm sorry this happened to you, what can we do?' Sadly, as a consolation prize, the manager offered up the food we'd ordered to take home since it was in the window waiting.... well what the hell else could they do with it? Smh, I declined that offer... too little too late;   I believe there was a second roach citing while I was using the facilities.  Thanks, but no thanks!\n\nListen, shit like this happens in businesses all the time;  it's not the offense that rankles ....mostly, it's the lack of acknowledgment and reconciliation.  A simple human exchange, not gratuitous,  but a display of genuine humility that demonstrates a remorse for your experience and restores the trust that makes me, the patron, feel good about spending my two very limited resources in your business; TIME & MONEY!!!\n\nCochon may have been voted the Best in New Orleans but the way they made me feel was the worst part of my trip! \n#EssenceFest #NolaFood #pighouse #warehousedistrict #gardendistrict #butchershop \n\n;", "date": "2017-07-06 01:28:19"}

I can't believe I've lived in Nola since 2009 and haven't dined at this Food Network feature--but better late than never! \n\nWe were meeting some friends and their out-of-town guests on Monday night after a big weekend (Essence Fest/4th of July) and didn't have reservations. I was nervous that our party of 6 may not get a table but it was no problem for the host. In fact, she was wiling to seat us without our entire party present but my hubby and I opted to sit at the bar until the rest of our party joined us. I had a delicious glass of rose and he had the Porch Swing which he enjoyed. \n\nOnce our party arrived, we were greeted by our server Jacob, who politely took our drink orders and gave us the rundown of the specials. He helped with drink choices and immediately let us know what the house was out of (no prob for us).  We started off with the oysters which were divine. As a not-a-huge-oyster fan, I highly endorse these! Also, please please please ask for the bread basket--it is filled with heavenly pillows of buttery goodness. Seriously, the rolls kicked my keto diet's ass! \n\nJacob kept the drinks flowing and we ended up ordering a couple of bowls of gumbo, another order of the oysters, the crawfish pie, the mac-and-cheese, and the ribs. Y'all, everything was ahhh-mazinggggg! The gumbo (which is how we actually ended up here..if you google Gumbo, Cochon nails the ranked list!) features a thick roux; I can't recall if it was seafood or sausage gumbo but it definitely was a hit with everyone. The $13 (!) crawfish pie was jumbo sized with a flaky crust and abundantly filled crawfish which totally made it worth the price. Mac and cheese was definitely more of a \"a little mac with all the cheese\" not that we were opposed to at all, very rich and delicious! I didn't try the ribs but there weren't any left overs so I suspect they were delicious. We finished off with the peach dessert--can't quite recall the name of it as (I was 3 glasses in at this point!). \n\nOur bill came out to about $50/person but we all felt the food and ambiance was totally worth it. Jacob's service was casual and consistent with the ambiance of the restaurant which I'd describe as casual but the food is definitely gourmet.

I'm positive that if any of the restaurant staff reads this review, they will most likely write it off as a typical angry Yelper.  That assumption would be far from the truth.  We love dinning out, especially at restaurants with great reviews, but tonight fell short of the considerable hype Cochon has received.\n\nOur meal began with a server who spoke so softly we had no chance of understanding.  We were dining with our daughter and inquired if they had a children's menu or children's options.  In hushed tones we faintly heard our server's disdain for even asking about children's options.  She whispered that our daughter could have the macaroni and cheese or the alligator tossed in a spicy mayonnaise with mint (obviously our server understands deftly the palette of a child).  We settled on the macaroni.\n\nUpon her next visit to the table, our quiet server asked if we were ready to order.  I asked if we could order our first of several courses and she informed us the chef prefers only full orders.  Instead of arguing, we ordered two courses instead of the four I had hoped for.  Before our first course we were served dinner rolls with a very dry/tough exterior - like the bread had been microwaved.  Our first course was the alligator, the special porchetta, and the ribs.  We had to send the alligator back because it was so tough it was impossible to chew.  The porchetta was served cold, which was a surprise, but it could have been explained that way in the near-silent-verse of our server.  The ribs were very good!  \n\nThe entree courses were the cochon and the brisket served with sides of greens and twice baked stuffed potato.  The brisket was fine (a little heavy with smoke, but that's a personal preference).  The cochon was disappointing at best.  The pork was very dry despite it's  wonderfully moist braised cabbage and turnip accompaniments.  The twice baked stuffed potato was also very dry.  It desperately needed butter and/or sour cream to bring the over cooked potato back to life.\n\nWe left a great deal of food on the table, something that is a first for a heavy set man like myself.  The fact is the food was for the most part very dry and lacking the panache that I've heard about from the likes of Alton Brown and Anthony Bourdain.  Our post-Nouvelle-Creole-Southern meal left us wishing for better sourced products, careful cooking, butter/fat/sauces, and outstanding, audible service.  I don't mind spending money on good food (we just dropped $800 at Per Se for two), but tonight I wasted $143 on a mediocre at best meal.\n\nI would suggest skipping this restaurant and server 201 T (we never heard her name and this was how it was listed on the bill).  Enjoy one of the New Orleans classics instead.", "date": "2017-08-02 01:37:10"}

Luckily I got a chance to grab some lunch there on a recent vacation with my family.  I have to say that everything exceeded my expectations and I'm wondering when the next time I will be able to come back.\n\nTo start, the entire staff was awesome.  Beyond great table service, a lovely girl (want to say her name was Hope, but my memory is bad) assisted me in selecting some whiskey and beer to accompany my food.  She was very knowledgeable and went as far to pour me a couple of tastings to help me make up my mind.  There was a gentleman, who I assumed was the floor manager, checked on us at least a couple of times.  Lastly, we were able to catch up with Chef Stephen in Cochon Butcher next door.  He was super cordial and took time out to take a picture with my daughter and talk food with me.  I've met many famous Chefs and not all of them are so accommodating let alone, genuinely sincere.\n\nGetting back to beverages, they have a nice selection of bourbon, rye and other whiskeys.  They also do whiskey flights which would normally appeal to me, but I wanted to try something different and perhaps rare.  I ended up with some Weller 12 with a tasting of the Weller Special Reserve Cochon Selection and the Elijah Craig 12 Cochon Private Barrel.  All 3 did not disappoint.  My wife ordered to the Hurricane Ophelia to get in the spirit of New Orleans.  She said it was the tastiest Hurricane she's ever had with quality rum and fresh fruit juices.  My daughter was super excited that they offered Dang Butterscotch Root Beer which is very similar to Butter Beer in Harry Potter World and Universal Studios. \n\nWe had a party of 4 including my 11 year old daughter and we decided to order a variety of plates and share family style, just so we could sample as much as we could in this one sitting.  I don't want to critique every dish, but there was nothing that wasn't very good.  If I had to pick a couple of favorites, it would be the pork cheeks with corn and chilies and the rabbit and dumplings.  These two dishes are seemingly simple, yet so perfectly executed.  I don't typically do dessert, but my daughter ordered the spicy chocolate pudding pie which didn't survive long.\n\nAt the end of the day, the meal was fantastic and the experience was even better.", "date": "2017-08-15 21:32:48"}

Filled with lots of chicken, but far from gumbo flair. This would make a great chicken \n\nWhile this place may be trendy, being tagged teamed by multiple servers and having them hover was more than I could stand, seemed like massive over kill.\n\nBeer was cold and yummy.\n\nIf you want to drop $40 for lunch and get a snack on the way back to work, this place is for you.

Great appetizer to start off with. Tastes a lot like fried popcorn chicken but a bit tougher. No unpleasant taste to gator meat for a first timer and the aoili sauce with chiles and parsley made for nice aromatics. Loved this dish\n\nRabbit and dumplings - 4 dumplings served in a cast iron skillet with slivers of shredded rabbit meat in a thick stew/gravy heavily seasoned with wine and scent of bay leaf to help cut away at the gaminess of the rabbit. A hearty stew but I'm not a huge fan of gamey meats.\n\nBraised Pork cheeks - recommended. I love the tenderness of braised pork cheeks. Just get it.\n\nSpecial Pork Porterhouse - recommended. Came to be about 60 dollars for the dish. Was expecting a large tomahawk sized piece of pork but received a presliced porterhouse steak with a great smokiness to it. Because the porter house has two different cuts of meat, the short loin and the tenderloin, there were two great textures. The tenderloin was more lean and still had the rich sweet smoky taste that reminded me of a very nice ham, but without the overly salty taste. The short loin portion had a nice rind of fat and pork skin over it, but I chose not to eat this as it was too tough for me. Came with cheesy scrambled eggs and crispy well cooked potatoes.\n\nLouisiana Cochon with cracklins and cabbage - I ordered this because it seemed like a local dish and was named after the restaurant. I had to look up what cochon was because I thought it was the name of a new regional dish or something. I was surprised to see that it was a puck-sized lump of cajun seasoned pulled pork that was pan fried, resting on a bed of cabbage, jus, and topped with pork cracklings. The pulled pork was not my favorite but it was an interesting dish overall\n\nSauteed greens - recommended. I'm new to southern cooking but I have a soft spot for seasoned collard greens infused with pork belly bacon flavors.\n\nMac and cheese - recommended. the side of mac and cheese on a skillet was delicious. Richly cheesy. Not the Kraft or Velveeta type but a real high quality cheesy taste to it.\n\nPrice - reasonable for the quality of ingredients and food prepared with care. Appetizers are around 10-15 dollars, entrees between 20-60, and sides at 7\n\nService - Excellent. Can't complain. Received all our food at once though appetizers did come out first.\n\nOverall - Interesting contemporary american take on classic southern fare. Love the vibe of the restaurant and the nice interior decor. Cochon butcher is right next door as well if you like sandwiches. Highly recommended stop.", "date": "2017-08-22 16:56:45"}

Going for lunch, I had no wait. I sat at the bar and had terrific service from the bartender, who was the perfect blend of friendly without being obnoxious. The cocktail I ordered (vodka rocks with a splash of cran) was a solid pour. I started with the chargrilled oysters and I don't know if there is anything I've eaten in life that was better. Coming from New England where the oysters are small and sweet, and having been to New Orleans many times where I know the oysters are big and succulent, I usually find them only good for being fried. My apologies on the assumption. These were phenomenal. Well seasoned, perfect heat, great charred flavor, with delicious light dinner rolls to sop up the extra butter sauce. I was worried the garlic chopped on top would be too aggressive, but the char grill cooked it perfectly. I then ordered the meat pie, which was like the hot pocket of your dreams. Stuffed with pork, rice, and trinity, with an etouffee-type gravy, it was heaven. I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't the crawfish pie I had read about, but deeply appreciate that they change items up seasonally.

Ended up sitting at the bar facing the kitchen, which was kind of neat. Service was good, food was not impressive.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the firegrilled oysters. There, I said it. First off you get 5 which means you always get to have the awkward conversation if you're sharing. They had more of a muscle-y texture to them. GF liked them a lot, maybe they just weren't my style. Drago's still holds the number one spot for me.\n\nWasn't really impressed with the gumbo either. Wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away either.\n\nBrisket: to quality this review, I should have known that ordering brisket outside of Texas was a mistake. They give you the lean cut, which was the first mistake, then they try to keep it moist with drippings, which doesn't work. There is no crust on the outside and the smokey flavor doesn't permeate the meat itself so you get a bite or 2 that tastes like roast beef. Best part of it was the horse radish potato salad, which was awesome.\n\nOverall there is better food available at better prices. I do like the sandwiches at their butcher shop, but I wouldn't bother with the main restaurant. Maybe I ordered wrong, but it's a pricey place for some of their limited menu items to be sub par.", "date": "2017-09-25 02:12:05"}

The server came out and poured large glasses of each wine for each guest. Half the table got Tempranillo, and half got CDP, although I had specifically requested that each guest get a half glass of each so everyone could taste both wines.\n\nWhen the beverage server came around a second time to freshen everyone's wine, he began to pour the Tempranillo into guests' glasses of Chateauneuf du Pape, and poured the CDP into the Tempranillo. I caught him on the first pour and asked him to stop pouring because he was mixing the glasses of wine that I paid for. He stared at me, continued to pour, and said \"Well, I guess they're all a blend now.\"   He promptly walked away, refusing to reconcile the problem by freshening the glasses he ruined or offering to remove the bottles from our tab.

No meters it seems. Otherwise free after 7 [2017]\n\nOverall solid. Butcher is actually a fav in the city.

I love how they have alligator and rabbit dishes which can't be found at every restaurant. I first ordered the fried alligator which I really enjoyed. It's true what they say about gator, it tastes like chicken. Or maybe it's just because they breaded the meat pieces and put it in a sauce, that to me tasted similar to a buffalo sauce for chicken wings. I still enjoyed the dish, but would have liked an experience where you could really taste the meat itself instead of just the sauce. For my main entree, I had the rabbit & dumplings. This dish is what I'm giving the established five stars for. All of the vegetables included in the stew part of the dish were cooked perfectly and were seasoned to perfection. The dumplings were cooked to a firmness that I prefer where it is easily broken with a fork and able to be tasted by itself. There were also decent sized bits of rabbit so you can get a clearer taste of the meat. I would love to order this again, especially on a chilly evening when I can let the warmth of the dish warm me up. Also if you're looking for a restaurant that has some handsome waiters, there were quite a few on my recent visit. I particularly found the bartender to be quite handsome so make sure to get a seat with a view.", "date": "2017-10-27 05:58:19"}

Make sure you get some of the complimentary bread to soak up that buttery oyster sauce!! We also had the boudin ball... it came with this spicy mustard that made for a well balanced bite. \n- Sadly, it all fell apart with the entree. We decided to split a main and a side since we doubled down on apps. We did the brisket with horseradish potato salad and the shrimp/eggplant dressing. Both dishes were unbelievably salty. The brisket had this brown gravy that was so salty we honestly thought someone made a mistake. The old drop the salt shaker into the pot move?? And the dressing was a shrimp flavored salt bomb. I would not recommend this side. We wished we got the mac and cheese since that looked really tasty. \n- Dessert was redeeming.. we got the hummingbird cake which came with a delicious cream cheese icing... yummy. \n\nOverall, Cochon is a cool spot with some nice plates.

Pork cheek with corn- pork was nice and tender on a light dill vinaigrette with corn. It was nicely composed and the ingredients were really complimentary, especially the corn. \n\n5.

The spicy mayo was interesting tho.\n\nPork Cheek (5/5): Tender bits of pork in a wonder braised sauce. The sweet potato \"cake -like\" side was interesting. Maybe not my favorite but the sweetness goes well with the pork.\n\nRabbit and Dumplings (4/5): This was kind of like a chicken-pot pie. The bottom is a rabbit stew with carrots and turnips, and it's topped with 4 \"dumplings\" which are essentially just pieces of thick bread/ pie crust. \n\nDo yourself a favor and give this place a try.

While a bit early we got a drink at the bar and by the time the drink arrived, our table was ready. We asked both the bartender and the servers about their fave dishes and they recommended the wood fire oysters, smoked ribs, ham hock and rabbit & dumplings, all of which we proceeded to order plus a side of roasted squash.

Perfect for soaking up excess juices from the wood fired oysters!\n\nWood fired oysters- seemingly the Star app and they did not disappoint. These oysters in Louisiana are HUGE!! And each oyster had two chunks of oysters on it. Such buttery goodness!\n\nSmoked ribs with watermelon pickle - hands down the best ribs I've ever had! Great flavor, lots of meat, chunky and super tender. It had all the elements - sweet, savory, slightly spicy and sour from the pickled watermelon. I think I would have been happy to just eat this all night!\n\nHam hock - this was good but not the best thing ever ordered. The ham was quite lean and the goat yogurt as quinoa was a nice balanced complement to it. But after the ribs nothing compared...\n\nRabbit & dumplings- the only disappointment of the night. Really bland and the dumplings didn't taste as good as the bread rolls. My date said it tasted a bit like something you'd get out of a can. We noted to our server that it was a bit bland and he kindly took it off our bill. Great service!!\n\nRoasted squash with seeds - amazingly good!! Should've ordered more!!!\n\nSuper yummy dinner!

Stop laughing and keep reading, for there is so much more to Cochon than cochon!\n\nThe thought of Cochon's wood-fire roasted oysters is a major stimulus for my salivary glands, and makes me want to fly from the Big Apple to the Big Easy just for a plate of these oysters. OK, I know you oyster snobs insist that oysters must only be eaten raw; go eat your raw oysters and leave these for me. The oysters are plump and juicy, and the chili garlic butter makes them deliciously fattening. \n\nThe fried chicken livers are served on toast with a pepper jelly that has a splendid flavor profile combining the sweet, the savory, and the spicy. The crawfish pie here is a great rendition of the Louisiana classic. \n\nThe rabbit and dumplings dish at Cochon is an interesting take on the traditional Southern chicken and dumplings, and the short ribs are tender as a fond young lover's dream (let's see who gets the reference to obscure poetry!). \n\nThe most interesting small plate item I've had at Cochon was the fried poached egg. I don't know how they did it, but it literally was an egg that was poached and then deep fried, and it did not lose the consistency and runny yolk of the poached egg. I've been back several times, but this item has not been on the menu again. If it ever makes an appearance again on Cochon's ever-changing menu, I will have to undertake a trip to NOLA just for a chance to enjoy this rare treat. \n\nThe menu changes frequently, but if you find the butterscotch pudding on the dessert menu, don't miss it. The pineapple upside down cake, served with a scoop of sorbet, is another great dessert. \n\nWhen I dine solo, I take a seat at the chef's counter; it's a great opportunity to watch them prepare and plate the dishes.", "date": "2018-01-05 06:50:41"}

We were a little late, but they still had our table ready for us. This restaurant is huge! There is a second floor in the back of the restaurant. I loved the ambiance there, with the muted lights, wooden tables/chairs, decorative bar with drinks lined up against the wall, it definitely reminded me a bit of the restaurants you can find in Los Angeles.\n\nTo me their menu is a mix of the traditional southern dishes with a twist. All together we ordered:\n\nFried Alligator 3/5\nPork Cheek 4/5\nPork Belly 5/5\nDuck & Andouille Gumbo 5/5 (perfectly seasoned and flavorful)\n3 lb Pork Shank 4/5\nRoasted Beet Salad 5/5 (people that don't like beets, liked this dish)\nRabbit & Dumpling 2/5\nMac and Cheese Casserole 5/5 (creamy with a kick)\nSmothered Greens 3/5\n\nSo to recap on the lower ranked dishes: the fried alligator had too much breading in it. I could not differentiate from the breading and the actual meat. The rabbit and dumpling was probably the hugest disappointment out of the batch because the flavors were just lacking. It reminded me of a pot pie but the flavors were muddled and nothing stood out about that dish. The smothered greens were a bit too salty/citrusy for me. That is saying something because I love both very much. \n\nWith the pork cheek, it was very tender but it also tasted a bit gamey to me. I don't think I've ever eaten pork cheek, so I am not sure if that's normal but everyone else seemed to like the dish. The 3lb pork shank came with this sweet potato souffle that was to die for. There was definitely a hint of butter in there and it was whipped to a smooth and fluffy texture. It was delicious. The pork shank was fall off the bone, but for 6 hungry people, there definitely was not enough meat in it. \n\nWith the higher ratings, you'll just have to trust me that they are pretty damn good. My husband also loved his drink, and said it's his favorite drink now. I can't remember what it's called but it has moonshine, salt & pepper, and root beer in it. If that's your thing, you should try it.", "date": "2018-01-16 16:23:27"}

We wanted to have a great meal on our last night in New Orleans and Cochon delivered.

This was one of the best single bites of food I have had in a while. The oysters were meaty and plump, and the garlic chili butter was to die for. I'm pretty sure it would make a shoe taste good. There are 5 in an order, so it's a difficult dish to share with two people. Who gets the last one? I would have been willing to fight for it, but my fianc\u00e9 is an angel and let me have the last one willingly. I chose well.\n\nWe also had the fried alligator. The alligator was tender and the chili mayo was flavorful, but I would have liked more heat. Overall, this was also a solid choice.\n\nWe decided to split the cochon for our entr\u00e9e. The pork was moist and so delicious. I also really enjoyed the cabbage. I don't know how, but it had a nice smoky flavor. We got the mac and cheese as a side. It was creamy and cheesy without being too heavy. It is also a must.\n\nWe finished everything with the malted chocolate cake. It was very good, but not a standout like the rest of the meal. I did enjoy the cookie crumble topping. It offered a nice balance to the chocolate.\n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive throughout our meal without being overbearing. They offered some great recommendations. The restaurant is inviting and has great southern charm. It is no surprise that Cochon has done so well for over 10 years.

It's all about the chili garlic mayo sauce in this, which my friends were a huge fan of (it's not exactly to my taste). \n\nPork cheek - Quite tender meat. \n\nRoasted beet salad - I'd probably skip this unless you just want something lighter to cut the heavier dishes, because the rendition here was fine but nothing noteworthy. \n\nWood fired cauliflower - Very yummy and flavorful. Nice use of vinaigrette and pork to add flavor and a pop to the dish. \n\nRabbit and dumplings - I was worried I wouldn't like this because everyone kept describing it as a riff of chicken pot pie, which I dislike. But I was pleasantly surprised. The dumplings were more like large chunks of dough and the rabbit was strips of rabbit in the gravy. I liked that there wasn't pepper, which I think is one of the main things I dislike about chicken pot pie. Was it my favorite dish? No. Am I glad I tried it? Yes. \n\nDry rubbed ham hock with quinoa, herbs & goat yogurt - The ham was nice and smoky and tender, and actually came on the bone which was a surprise. Favorite dish for one of my dining companions.\n\nAt the end of the day, none of this is food I necessarily crave / would be dying to eat again, except the wood fired oysters, but that's because I'm not generally a huge fan of heavy foods.

The alligator is perfectly crispy on the outside & tender on the inside-- the bite with the sauce & mint made us pretttty damn happy. It seemed like every single person in the restaurant had an order of the oysters (5 per order), so we decided to see if they lived up to the hype: they did. \n\nFor dinner, I wanted a simple piece of fish, so I got the fire roasted fisherman's special with a side of collared greens and bacon. The fish was perfectly cooked, and I was SO impressed that I didn't have any bones in the fish. I could bathe in the collared greens. \n\nFor dessert, we shared beignets. They were also delish.

The pork cheeks was my favorite dish of the night I'd say. \n\nWe shared two entrees: the Louisiana Cochon and the braised short rib. Both absolutely delicious.

I am sure people are crazy over these dishes, I think Nola people eat hella salty (probably the way they prepare the food) but I felt like I didnt enjoy these 2 because it was too salty for me - So for those who are aware of sodium intake, prepare yourself. \nBut the way they prepare it, I think it's very well crafted. \n\nPricing is reasonable, I need to give a non biased review on this despite my experience. :) it is worth the experience & food quality. \n\nIf I come back, I would try the prosciutto plate & cheese of theirs", "date": "2018-03-07 18:48:40"}

There were 3 of us and we ordered quite a bit: 5 drinks, 4 appetizers, 3 entrees and 3 desserts.  Being underwhelmed is an understatement.\n\nI always keep fairness in mind and I truly hope that our experience is not the norm at Cochon.  Cocktails were solid.  Well balanced and spirit forward but not overwhelming.  Wood fired oysters were the best food we had that night.  Plump and juicy oysters, baked to perfection, with just the right amount of toppings.  But food overall was over seasoned and overcooked.  Ribs weren't tender, and they were soaked in heavy bbq sauce.  Vegetables were cooked to death and very salty.  Other meat dishes were all pretty much along the same profile.  Desserts were nothing special.  Similar to what you can get from a decent deli.  Fried alligators were ok.  I've had it few times before.  It always tasted like leaner meatier fried chicken to me.  it's not bad if that's what you are craving but I could get the same thing in NY. \n\nAnother thing that threw me off was the service.  Southern hospitality didn't exist here.  Or did it only exist if you looked Caucasian?  Dare I wonder the fact that we were the only non-white party at the time had something to do with how our service was given?  I couldn't help not to notice that other patrons received warm greetings and farewells.  We got none of that.  I couldn't overhear the interactions between other servers and their tables but our waitress didn't seem to want to speak more than she had to and was not attentive.  She had the persona of a crass diner waitress.  \n\nSure, price wasn't bad for someone who is used to coastal living cost.  But it is on the higher end in the NOLA spectrum.  We had way better food and more thoughtful services at cheaper prices.  Maybe I'm actually being lenient for giving the experience 2 stars instead of 1.  Good cocktails & oysters could do that to you.", "date": "2018-03-19 16:42:55"}

It was a Wednesday around 3pm. Had to be back by 6pm to do some work so we decided to get a quick bite. Not sure how long we would be able to stay in NOLA since we were only able to reserve the RV park we were at for 2 days. So I did not want to waste the meal. \n\nLogged in to Yelp and saw Cochon was highly rated so we hit the road. Was able to find some street parking fairly easily around 4pm, not sure how the parking situation may be during busier times.\n\nService was great, we were sat quickly and everything came out promptly as it should. I'm not big on uppity fine dining type places. One thing I liked about Cochon is that it was almost like being at a fine dining restaurant without the fine dining uppity atmosphere. It was very casual.\n\nWe started with the baked oysters... amazing. Perfectly cooked and the sauce/seasoning was so good. Their bread was also very good.\n\nFor our main course I had the short rib which was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. The flavor was insane, the sauce, the mushrooms the fried onions all worked perfectly together. My girlfriend had the Cochon which while not as \"intense\" as my short rib was also very good.\n\nSo happy with the food we had so far we decided we had to try the dessert and what else could we choose on our first day in NOLA but the chocolate beignets. Now I've never had beignets so I honestly can't compare it to any other beignet. What I can compare it to is other desserts I've had and this was by far one of the best. The beignets were very sweet and you put that together with the amazing coffee ice cream which has a very good coffee flavor but is not overly sweet and it was a perfect match.\n\nTwo entrees, one appetizer, dessert and two drinks came out to just under $100.

That's also the last good album he's released, so its been a good 15 years since he's dropped any real knowledge. I like to throw random shots at Nas' biggest fan from time to time to rile up his \"Stans,\" so here's the obligatory But I Digress...\n\nI bring up the aforementioned gem because I argue with a friend about pork all the time. For some reason he doesn't partake in the beast for archaic reasons. He thinks pigs are filthy animals, and I hope he didn't get that reasoning from Jule's in Pulp Fiction. He's not a religious fellow so I can't surmise that's his reasoning either. Not that eating pork would have kept us from passing through the Pearly Gates...we both led seedy lives in our youth, and the shenanigans of 2001 could solely keep us out #neverforget. \n\nRegardless, I don't argue with him anymore about it. I just tag him in every picture I post on social media that includes pork. Hey, I'm petty like that.\n\nI bookmarked Cochon via recommendations online. I'd say I got it from Eater, but then I wouldn't be a company man...and, I want another Review of the Day, so let's just say I used Yelp.\n\nCochon is a french word for pig, dirty swine, or something along those lines (maybe my friend was right). You didn't think your boy was cultured huh? I learned that in France, as boucherie plates are my thing, and if you hang out in butcher shops long enough you pick up a few things here, and there. You're welcome.\n\nI got here right as it opened at 11am on a Sunday, and a line was already forming. I'm not sure that's a good sign or not as people line up those for highly overrated beignets on Bourbon Street. Give me savory over sweet any day.\n\nThe first thing that was ordered were the wood fired oysters with garlic chill butter, and boucherie board. The clams came out first, and they were smokey, and as advertised, a bit spicy. Definitely good, but I think I prefer my mollusks al natural. The board had pickled veggies, pate, head cheese, sliced pork/hams, and toasted bread to put them on. This is what I came here for. It was all excellent, especially the head cheese.\n\nLastly the Cochon was ordered. I didn't know what it was at first, so I had to ask the waiter. He told me it was shredded pork rolled up into a ball, and lightly pan fried. It was accompanied with cracklins, pickled turnips, and cabbage. Cracklin's are like upscale pork rinds, and mixed with the meat were great. The cabbage was flavorful, and also complemented the pork well. I can't say I've had something like this being a gringo from Alaska, but I am now a fan. \n\nYou know, I'm not sure my friend is on Yelp. I might have to ask him to join, and follow me (as you should all be doing), so he can see pork is a thing of beauty. While I do that, get the boucherie board, and check out my other reviews of New Orleans cause I got a few coming people. Until next time, salute!", "date": "2018-04-06 02:04:22"}

Felt very welcome and at home here. \n\nThe Wood-Fired Oysters with Chili Garlic Butter are an absolute must!!! \nI mean even if oysters aren't your thing, the flavor, the texture, the tast will definitely change your mind. I was so sad when I was done with my appetizer that I wished I had ordered a second plate. (Yes, they are that good). Also the shrimp and deviled egg gumbo is a must too. Just add that to the list. \n\nI'd say skip the Cochon plate, it had a unique particular flavor to it, and stick with the small plates and boucherie to share with someone. We had the Smoked Pork Ribs with Watermelon Pickle and these were pretty tasty, flavorful, messy, definitely going to see some hand wipes later on, which they actually give you after!\n\nWe also tried the Boucherie Plate, which was filled with crouton crackers, pickles, and prosciutto like meats. Excellent Plate to Share!\n\nI also want to make sure that if you haven't already guessed that this restaurant is called COCHON, so plan on a lot of pork dishes.

They do not sing together as one, they overpower and attempt to one up the others leaving you slightly nauseous.\n\nTo start off our experience we tried the fried alligator with chili garlic mayonnaise. The alligator was delicious, but the mayo felt cheap and used far to liberally. I wanted to wash it off.\n\nNext up came the poached shrimp. Not to mince words, it was straight up terrible. One bite and I refused to go back to it.

Had I stuck with just that plate and not tried any other dishes I would have probably had a higher review.

After attending WWE Axxess nearby, I decided to take my friends here to dine on some legit southern food. If you've ever seen the Netflix show, you can say I was making the same faces that Phil makes when chomping. \n\nChomped:\n1. Fried Alligator - tasted like chicken.\n\n2. Boucherie Plate - came with an assortment of ham, head cheese and pat\u00e9. I didn't figure out how to properly chomp this to balance out the flavors until I combined everything and stacked them on the crouton crackers. The saltiness from the prosciutto was balanced by the bitterness from the mustard and sweetness from the pickled veggies. \n\n3. Smoked Pork Ribs - smoky and tender af. \n\n4. Louisiana Cochon - a pulled pork dish. Overall, I thought this dish was on the salty side. \n\n5. Rabbit & Dumplings - rabbit also tasted like chicken. Make sure to soak this up with some bread (other than the dumplings). \n\n*Notable mention - sliders; this reminded me of the bread they sell in the Chinatown bakeries (\u5976\u6cb9\u9910\u5305). So soft and buttery!\n\nOtherwise, the decor was hip and trendy, and they even had a wood oven in the back with an open kitchen! Overall, I would come here again when I come back to NOLA to try all the other offerings. I saw the cooks making wood-fired oysters which looked absolutely mouthwatering.", "date": "2018-04-11 20:34:11"}

The second best item we had. They had just the right amount of bacon, vinegar, and kick. \nRabbit and Dumplings - served in a small skillet, but definitely heavy enough to be a main course. Comes with four dumplings each about the size of an egg. The dumplings had excellent texture. Unfortunately, my serving only had one piece of rabbit that was about half the size of one of the dumplings. The texture of the rabbit was also excellent, I just wish that there had been more of it. Also, although the gravy had a silky mouth feel and was well salted, the herbs in it were so overpowering that you could not actually taste the rabbit, dumplings, or root vegetables.\nHouse Lemonade - tart and refreshing, just a tad on the sour side, mellowed as the ice melted. Did a good job of cutting through the richness of the dishes and working as a pallet cleanser between plates.\nBlueberry Buttermilk Sorbet - The highlight of my meal. Amazing blueberry flavor with an ever so slight tanginess from the buttermilk, sweet but not overly sweet, and great texture. A perfect dessert.\nThe service was great. You have two servers in your section so there is always someone available if you need anything. Both of our servers were extremely pleasant and helpful. \nFinal thoughts, I was really hoping for an amazing meal here and, though it wasn't awful by any means, it wasn't $100 good.", "date": "2018-05-05 15:09:33"}

Our waitress was extremely friendly as well! \n\nFor starter, my friends and I had the wood-fired oysters and the fried alligator. The oysters were sooo good! I have to say these beat Acme for sure. They were succulent, juicy, and so flavorful with the garlic butter topping. The fried alligator was also tactfully done, though the sauce made it a little heavy. \n\nFor entree, our group fell in love with the short rib. It was so moist and tender, YOU MUST TRY IT! The rice was also served with a flavor-pact sauce as well. Nothing I would ask to change the way it is! The ham mock, ok the other hand, was a bit too tough and dry for my taste.

It was great after walking all day. And great with all the dishes. \n\nThe Cochon came with cabbage, cracklings & pickled turnips. The pork was perfectly roasted, tender and juicy and the cracklings were so crispy and savory.

And chocolate dust on top. It was very appealing.\n\nThe ok:\nMac and Cheese - it was simple and cheesy. I liked broiled crunchy cheesy top. It was not very different or unique. \n\nFried alligator- it tasted like fried chicken nuggets with a mayo Sriracha sauce. \n\nFried boudin- it was not very flavorful.

At the point we plan to return to NOLA, one of the first things I'll be doing is making our reservation for dinner (maybe more than one).\n\nCochon serves Cajun/Creole and seafood dishes.  The word, cochon, is French for domestic pig, so as you'd expect, pork is featured throughout the menu.  They also have pig images interwoven throughout the space and dinner experience.  The space is a bit trendy and suitable for date night.\n\nReservations are highly recommended.  This is a popular venue and they get very busy.  We were seated at the chef's bar and had a front row seat to the high-energy effort being put forth in the kitchen.  It also made me realize that I MUST try the ribs the next time we dine here.  They looked amazing.\n\nHaving said that, the thing that has me day-dreaming about Cochon and making me want to return to NOLA are the wood-fired oysters.  GET THE WOOD-FIRED OYSTERS!  They are the best thing I've eaten all year - maybe longer.\n\nThat statement requires a bit of backstory.  I've never really been thrilled by oysters.  It's true.  I've tried them from time to time, maybe once every other year and they've always fallen into the A-okay zone.  I tend to migrate to scallops and snow crab first with lobster and shrimp ordered often.  Oysters typically don't hit my radar.  The wood-fired oysters at Cochon changed that.\n\nThey're so popular, I saw the chef responsible for that station putting them into the oven in trays of several dozen.  They're topped with an amazing chili-garlic butter.  HIGHLIGHT OF OUR TRIP - not an exaggeration.\n\nWe enjoyed the Rabbit and Dumplings for our entr\u00e9e.  It comes in cast iron and had plentifully chunks of tender rabbit with potato, carrots and onion.  The dumplings were soft and absorbed the rich, savory stew broth nicely.  Altogether, an awesome comfort-food experience.\n\nWe passed up some of the richer desserts for ice cream to finish.  Then again, I'm an ice cream fiend and that tends to happen.  The ice cream was very good and came with a sugar-cookie garnish in the shape of a pig.\n\nFinal Assessment:  Excellent food!  Ingredients locally sourced.  Friendly, professional, service (our drinks were refilled regularly).  It took a bit of time for our food to come out but it was totally worth it.  We're mega-fans and we want more oysters!  5 stars all day long.  \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "date": "2018-05-27 15:48:28"}

I had a work dinner with my colleagues and they picked a place focused on eating dead pigs so what was I supposed to do?  I didn't want to be that \"difficult vegetarian\", so I went with the flow.\n\nCochon was featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and it's been written up about so I was curious to see what this pig-obsessed restaurant would be like.  Since we were a large group, we had to do a special sharing prix-fixe where it was $55 per person to share a bunch of food that I couldn't even eat.  We didn't realize we had to share everything until we got to the restaurant and I didn't understand why it wasn't just a regular individual prix-fixe for $55.  The value of the meal was terrible for someone that doesn't eat dead pigs so I don't recommend this restaurant if you're a vegetarian/pescatarian.  The server also made me feel like a problem as a pescatarian and was kind of salty even though I had called ahead of time and arranged for one of the courses to be pescatarian.\n\nWhile I was dissatisfied with their food selection, they did have a nice assortment of unique cocktails.  I had the Smoke on the Water, which was a Mezcal cocktail with sage, honey, and smoked salt.  The smokiness came through and the sage gave it a comforting flavor. From the few things I could eat, everything tasted good but I wasn't blown away by it.  I really think this place puts most of their effort into their meat.\n\nThe bread with butter was delicious, the wood-fired oysters in chili-garlic butter were heavenly but I could only try one since we were all sharing 6 oysters and paying and arm and a leg.  The opening appetizer, a poached shrimp in a clam broth with basil and chilis was refreshing and unique, but not very exciting, I was appreciative of the fact that they let me have that while everyone ate the charcuterie board.  I think there were about 4 main meat courses served and one of the last dishes presented was a fish served \"fisherman's style\" with some nice spices and seasonings garnished with onions and cilantro, I've had better fish in Chicago though.  It just wasn't as good as it looked.  I think the texture could have been flakier and it could have been seasoned more.  The side of the macaroni and cheese casserole was another highlight of the meal.  It was rich, baked, and glorious, but when you're paying $55 for a prix-fixe meal, the best part of the meal shouldn't be the macaroni and cheese.  The desert platter was sinfully tasty and the best part of the meal since I could eat it with everyone.  The key lime pudding was extremely refreshing and the Malted Chocolate Cake was decadently delicious.\n\nCochon is in the Warehouse District so it's going for a modern, New American vibe.  I liked the ambience but that was pretty much it.  On top of not being able to eat most of this shared meat feast, they tried to charge me an extra $9 for the shrimp on top of the regular $55 prix fixe.  I of course had to argue with the server and he was pretty rude about it but they fixed it.  I was pretty disgusted that they tried to make me pay more when I barely ate this $55 shared prix-fixe meal.  I obviously don't plan on coming back here again and I don't recommend this for anyone with a dietary restriction.  It's just one of those places that thinks carnivorously eating dead animals is trendy and I'm over it.", "date": "2018-06-18 01:38:02"}

Something you'd find in most cosmopolitan cities; smaller, food centric menus offering a little something for everyone. Done with great attention but over the top. \nMary, our server was attentive but non pushy; answering my many questions and offering suggestions. She was very pleasant and was able to carefully space several courses over a few hours. Well done, Mary. \nI started with the Boudin balls and shared a charcuterie plate with my dinner mate. The charcuterie was big and could have easily fed 4. Seeing this, I knew I had to take it easy to enjoy my salad course; blue crab dressed in green goddess and served over a nice light selection of greens. Light and fresh. Lastly I had the rabbit and dumplings. Forgoing the fish [my 1st choice] since I've had plenty of seafood this week; the rabbit was perhaps a slight mistake. It wasn't bad but it might as well have been a chicken pot pie. Next time I will trust my instincts.\nOverall a very good restaurant with a great selection of craft drinks, micro beers and a nice wine list. Highly recommend when or if you ever tire of traditional NOLA creole cuisine. Which I never do.", "date": "2018-06-19 22:16:56"}

I think this actually stole the show from the cochon.\n\nOven-roasted gulf fish \"fisherman's style\" - I can't remember what type of fish they said this was but it was pretty basic. It's nothing you couldn't make at home with some spices and some lemon.\n\nBraised beef short rib with rice pilaf & mushroom gravy - I'm not a huge fan of braised meats, but the mushroom gravy was very good.\n\nMacaroni & cheese casserole - really can't go wrong with mac and cheese.

We are so happy we had our lunch here. The food was delicious. We visited WWII museum and wanted to explore the area. This restaurant is walking distance, so I highly recommend the walk for the food. I ordered the braised beef short ribs with rice and mushrooms, my husband got the gumbo and heirloom tomatoes with crab salad. We also shared the mushroom pie as an appetizer. Let's just say we inhaled our meal. The mushroom pie is a large mushroom empanada. The crust was crusty and flaky and there has to be at least half a pound of mushroom inside. Very enjoyable. The bread provided with lunch was freshly baked and it absorbed all the fatty deliciousness of the braised short ribs. The gumbo was made from a dark roux and you can taste it in the dish. A little strong in my opinion, but my husband enjoyed it. The crab and heirloom tomatoes was tasty. I was expecting large heirloom tomatoes cut up, but they used grape and cherry sized tomatoes. Good balance with the crab, but I would have enjoyed more tomato umami. I was go here again and explore more of their meal.", "date": "2018-07-04 23:29:43"}

The three of us all felt very \"meh\" about the meal overall and would definitely skip this place next time.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nMy favorite thing was probably the fire grilled oysters. The sauce, generously ladled over the succulent oysters, was zesty and tangy with just the right amount of kick. The fried alligator had the texture of tough chicken and was smothered in what tasted like sriracha mayo. We definitely ordered it more for the novelty. I remember thinking that the fried soft shell crab was good...but not $30 good. The crawfish pie was nothing to write home about. The catfish courtbouillon was so forgettable that even while staring intensely at the picture I took, I cannot recall even a hint of what it tasted like.\n\n0/1 Stars for Value --\nHonestly, you're paying extra for the ambience. It's $8-12 for an appetizer and easily $20-30 for an entree. I thought the appetizers were worth a try, but the entrees were disappointing for the price. You'll easily pay $30-40 pp, which I guess is standard fare for date night (but wouldn't you rather have delicious food for that price?)\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nOur server was nice and the food came out promptly. We weren't in a hurry though because we had actually just \"snacked\" next door at the Cochon Butcher. The complimentary bread was great. Whenever we go to nice restaurants, my friends are all like \"Oh my God, stop filling up on bread and butter.\" I just wish nice restaurants didn't consider it gauche to offer bread refills because let's be real, I'm not going to eat/order any less...and BREAD.

Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed with most of our experience.\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by he hostess and manager. We arrived around 6:40pm. We did not have a reservation but the restaurant was 3/4 empty. We asked for a table for 2. The manager replied and said, \"we are coming on a heavy reservation time. We can seat you at the bar of chef's bar.\" We looked around at the mostly empty restaurant pretty confused. We felt like we were in a Seinfeld episode or something. We were not going to leave just because of their seating issues, so we decided to eat at the bar.\n\nBartenders were friendly, made good drinks, and had fast service. Waters were served as soon as we sat with hot bread. We loved that, so we thought the rest of the night would flow smoothly. Unfortunately that was not the case.\n\nFor dinner we ordered the catfish, hamhock, and rib tips appetizer. My catfish was very good. The bartender recommended the hamhock. The hammock was extremely dry and salty. It lacked flavor and there was no sauce to compensate. We asked the bartender if there were any bones in the rib tips. He told us no. When we got the appetizer, it was extremely hard to cut through because there were in fact bones in the dish. \n\nBy the time we were ready to leave it was about 7:20. At this point the dining room still wasn't anywhere near full. Between the lack of menu knowledge for the staff and the manager seating us at the bar with plenty of open table space, this restaurant doesn't deserve more than a 2. I understand that you want to make sure your reservations get a table when they arrive, but that was a bit ridiculous. I would not recommend this restaurant or go ever again.", "date": "2018-07-22 22:22:22"}

As soon as you walk in, it smells like you have stepped into a bbq smoke pit. I love to smell that; as it tells you the place is properly preparing their meats. I ordered the ribs with the mac and cheese casserole. The mac and cheese was easily the best I have had in a very long time. It was masterfully made and served on its own in a cast iron skillet. I get chills thinking about how delicious it was. It had a crispy crust on top, with very high quality melted cheese underneath. The ribs were also very delicious. The watermelon pickling that they garnish over the top of the meat was good individually, but I didn't understand this flavor profile in connection with the smoked meat. It definitely didn't take away from how great the ribs were though. The meat was super tender and seasoned perfectly. They put a sauce on the ribs but honestly, you really could just eat the meat by itself with the way it was seasoned. \n\nI recommend getting here before 7-7:30 on the weekend. Our reservation was for 6:30. The restaurant wasn't full at that time and there were plenty of seats in there. After about 30-40 mins, there wasn't an empty seat in the house. I also recommend sitting in a both. They have mood lighting in the backrest and it really adds a ton to the ambiance of the dimly lit restaurant. \n\nThe service was excellent here. They use a team approach to waiting each table, so be prepared to be waited on by multiple servers. Everyone was extremely friendly and make you feel at home.

It was 4:45 and we were hungry so we decided to make a reservation and come back another day. We strutted back in the next day with our reservation and we're quickly seated in the section of the world's most unpleasant waitress Whitney. Between throwing the menus on the table, ignoring when we asked questions, and appearing to be extremely distracted I find it hard to find anything even remotely positive to say. We asked for the wine list and when she finally strolled over with it we were well into our main courses. She grudgingly answered two questions about our wine choices. Without saying anything, she chucked the dessert menu on the table. We asked about the tea selection and she said \"what? Oh we have some green\". We ordered three green teas and the fourth member of our party began asking about the daily selection of sherbert and mid sentence the waitress turned and walked away. We asked another waiter to cancel our tea orders and bring the check. Derwin was assisting her and was possibly the saving grace. He was polite and quick to ensure our needs were met. I would have been happy to share all of this with the manager, however we were never asked. He stood by the bar the entire time and didn't seem to even pay attention to the tables. \n\nThe food? It wasn't bad and it wasn't good..We had the ribs, pork cheeks, beef short ribs, and the cobia amongst other dishes. These are worth mentioning because they were tasty.

Oh and their dessert... AH-mazing!! Made fresh daily... order the Apple pie and cookie layered cake!!\n\nMy only 'gripe' is the wine list isn't updated... this would be my only point to improve. \n\nAll in all, highly recommend this off the beaten path spot! I also recommend a reservation... they're super busy and always packed... not sure how we were able to get in but we did!", "date": "2018-09-24 20:13:36"}

The alligators were a bit chewy for my liking, my husband thought it tasted like chicken- I on the other hand am indifferent to the dish. \n\nSmothered greens- too salty but otherwise the consistency was cooked perfectly.\n\nMac and cheese- tasted like boxed Mac and cheese. I was hoping for a more gourmet cheese-like taste and not the processed taste this dish had.\n\nLouisiana Cochon- pulled pork that's fried in a circular form. By itself it was a little dry but when eaten w the ingredients it came with (tasted like a sweet pickled ingredient, cabbage, and cracklings) it blended well together. \n\nOver all it was an experience.

I heard good things after my dad and brother ate here twice on their trip to New Orleans a few years ago, so I came in with high expectations.\n\nUnfortunately, Cochon didn't deliver. We started with the grilled oysters, fried alligator, and fresh cucumber. The oysters were fine but didn't stack up to grilled oysters I have had elsewhere. The texture was fine but the sauce didn't quite give the punch I was expecting. Being gulf oysters, they needed it. The alligator was ok. The meat was nice and tender but didn't taste like anything special and I found the pieces to be over-battered. The glaze they came with was a little on the sweet side, and could have used something to balance it out. The cucumbers were nothing more than I could make at home -- just cubed cukes with a simple dressing and Italian parsley. The parsley I thought didn't work at all in this dish, and that's speaking as a big fan of Italian parsley.\n\nFor mains we ordered the oven-baked fish and the smoked ham hock. The fish was pretty good and seasoned well without overpowering it, but nothing special. The accompaniments could have used some char. The smoked ham hock was a big miss. It is just a giant chunk of ham on the bone with some beans and greens. The texture is good but the flavor of the dish was too one-dimensionally rich for me.\n\nFor dessert we had the banana pudding. They definitely didn't hold back on the rum which was nice, but the actual bread pudding was dry and essentially needed to be dunked as a prerequisite to eating.\n\nOverall, the meal was fine but nothing special in a city with so many amazing restaurants.

Warm and inviting, but not stuffy or pretentious at all. There is just a hint of burning wood in the air and that enhances the experience. I was seated promptly and water was on the table immediately.\n\nMy server arrived quickly and greeted me. I ordered a nice glass of wine to get things started while I Das perusing the menu.\n\nWarm bread and butter arrived shortly and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the butter was just soft enough to be spreadable. A great way to start the evening.\n\nI first ordered the fried alligator. I've had alligator multiple times at other restaurants and it is a tricky meat to cook. It is often dry or chewy. Cochon, however, got it right! Perfect bite-sized chunks of tender, flavorful meat with a delicious chili garlic mayo dipping sauce. The portion was very generous and I loved every bite.\n\nFor the next course, I ordered the Rabbit & Dumplings along with a side of smothered collard greens. Definitely comfort food. Both arrived piping hot and in generous portions. I enjoyed every bite of both dishes. The rabbit was tender and flavorful, the gravy was the perfect consistency, and the dumplings were tender and soaked up the gravy nicely. The greens had lots of flavor and were very tender.\n\nSadly, I was stuffed by the end of the meal and couldn't manage to try a dessert. I save that for another time.\n\nHighly recommend Cochon.

They were on top of their game and I think, the only servers in my life to say \"Thank You for coming in and dining with us today\". They were speedy, provided eating tips to elevate our Cochon experience, hooked me up with all the hot dinner rolls I could have ever wanted, checked up on us often, and even offered to roll me out if I was stuffed (haha... because I ordered quite a bit for 2 people).\n\nMost if not all of Cochon's dishes are served tapas/family style. Everything we ordered was exceptional. The dinner rolls they served were fresh from the oven warm and fluffy like a Hawaiian roll, minus the soft exterior and sweetness. Read on for more details!\n\nFRIED ALLIGATOR WITH CHILI GARLIC MAYO - if you've never had alligator before, it tastes like white chicken meat. The chili garlic mayo was reminiscent of Sriracha mayo and when completely coated over each cube of alligator meat, it reminded me of Chinese prawn and walnuts, minus the shrimp and honeyed walnuts.\n\nFRIED LIVERS WITH PEPPER JELLY TOAST - I love fried internals and fried livers is no exception. This one tasted like fluffed up foie gras! The \"pepper jelly\" was just a fancy way of saying Asian sweet & spicy chili sauce, but slightly thicker.\n\nWOOD-FIRED OYSTERS WITH CHILI GARLIC BUTTER - of all the ways oysters are served, wood-firing them might be my favorite. The sweet juices are all collected at the base of the shell and fused with chili garlic butter. PRO TIP: ask for more buns so you can soak up that oyster chili garlic butter sauce. You won't be disappointed. \n\nRABBIT & DUMPLINGS - this dish is basically a deconstructed, not-quite-but-pretty-much-is a pot pie. The dumplings were just empty dough pockets but oh damn, that soup was thick, hearty, and warmed my soul. The rabbit was soft and not dry at all. PRO TIP: also dip your buns here.", "date": "2018-12-07 05:35:47"}

It's one of those hipster/trying to be authentic to the area's cuisine type of place. Think of a toned down rustic/fancy restaurant like Hell's Kitchen, but WAYYY more affordable. It has that vibe.\n\nI'm knocking off one star because it took at least 15 minutes for someone to notice us to take our order after we were seated. We kept trying to make eye contact with various servers but it seemed like they were purposely trying to avoid us--not sure. Low key some of the servers seem to have somewhat of an arrogant vibe; the kind of vibe only hipsters can have (trust me). So that was slightly disappointing.\n\nThey have a short menu with appetizers, entrees, soups/salads, etc. They're known for the way they cook their pork (or couchon) and fried alligator. I would recommend getting the friend alligator for sure--it's one of those things you should try in NOLA and trust me, it tastes like chicken. Or it tasted like chicken to me and my wife claimed it tasted like a \"tough\" chicken. It's glazed in this sriracha/spicy mayo -- had a great kick to it and low key reminded me of the Asian American-style popcorn chicken I used to eat as a kid.\n\nI also recommend you get some kind of pork dish (if you eat pork). We had the bbq pork ribs w/ watermelon pickle. I could do without the watermelon pickle--it's a side garnish, so you can just take it off. The ribs themselves were delicious - very smoky and you can tell the BBQ glaze was homemade. It had a more sour and tangy taste - LOVED IT!\n\nWe also had the mac and cheese casserole. If you like cheesy, stringy, and melty mac and cheese, go for this. My wife liked it a lot, and I just liked it alright because 1. I'm lactose intolerant so I could only have a little bit and 2. It was a bit too gooey for me. But if you love this type of mac, trust me... you'll like this one.\n\nGive this place a shot - it won't disappoint!", "date": "2018-12-28 05:09:16"}

The mac n' cheese was fantastic. The pasta was cooked well and the blend of cheeses was just right -- not too much, not too little. The oysters were tasty but didn't blow our socks off. The pork ribs had a vinegary BBQ sauce which no one in our party much cared for. The jambalaya and sausage were crunchy without much flavor. \n\nWe then moved on to the smoked hamhock with hoppin' john and rabbit & dumplings. The hamhock was too rich. The hoppin' john was tasty but didn't balance the forward flavor of the hamhock. The rabbit & dumplings tasted like a bland stew. It was apparent that everything was very fresh. The mix of flavors just wasn't quite right and needed more seasoning. \n\nI had a rum cocktail with rum, lemon verbena, lime and ginger beer. It was excellent. The rest of my party had beer. \n\nYou'd think with all of the above, we'd be full. We weren't, so we ordered the pineapple upside down cake, the chocolate chip cake and the banana bread pudding'y thing. The pineapple upside down cake was the best of the bunch and it was good-to-excellent. even if it was the size of an ice-cream scoop. The chocolate chip cake was good and had a nice, light texture. The bready thing with the whipped cream was probably the biggest disappointment of the evening. It tasted like a bun with whipped cream on the top and doused in rum. The bread itself wasn't sweet, so it wasn't good.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, especially since the service was stellar (barring the bread issue).

Not a fan of the chili seasoning used on the oysters, didn't pair well. The crab \"salad\" is just crab meat in the crab shell and once again, the crab lacked seasoning. The ribeye sandwich had hope.

We arrived on time for our reservation and we're seated right away. When the waitress came by she immediately said \"Are you ready to order?\" We said we would like to order drinks first. She didn't seem thrilled. My husband ordered one of their drink specials off the menu and I asked if they had a Milk Punch (which is a very a common drink in New Orleans) or a Brandy Alexander. She seemed confused and said no milk punch, so I ordered the Brandy Alexander. They have a large full Bar. This should not have been a problem. She came back and said they didn't have the ingredients and couldn't make it. Brandy, Creme de Cocoa and cream. I ordered a White Russian, which is basically the same thing only made with Kahlua. She came back with the drinks and asked if we were ready to order. We asked several questions about items on the menu, she seemed to be rushed and then said she'd come back when we were ready, instead of giving us a few minutes to think about the info she gave us. She never told us the soup or the fish special. We only found out about them by hearing a different server tell another table. For appetizers we ordered the fried alligator and the smoked grilled oysters. They were very good. For main course we had the Crispy Pork Shoulder and the smoked BBQ Ribs. Also, excellent. We finished and she took the dishes away, then returned and placed the check on the table. Did not offer us dessert, coffee or an after dinner drink. We asked for a dessert menu and she took the check away and had someone else bring the menu over. When she came back we ordered the Meyer Lemon pie, also yummy. Again she didn't ask us if we wanted coffee or any drinks. We got the feeling from her that she was not interested in serving us, felt we were a bother and want to get us out as soon as possible. When the service is bad, it really takes away from the enjoyment of the meal. We travel a lot and eat at fine restaurants often. We have friends that are restaurant owners and friends that are servers. We know how hard they work and always tip between 20-25%. We left her a 15% tip. We also stopped on the way out to inform the Manager of our experience. We believe that if you don't let the Management know about the problems, they can't correct them.

The restaurant was nowhere near full and occasionally you'd see plates stacking up at the pass through and a huddle of servers standing there talking. I don't know if they serve slow food so you can enjoy and anticipate your next dish or if they're just slow as Christmas. \n\nMy husband ordered the Ham Hock with HoppingJohn. It was pretty good. I had a roast beef dish that has replaced the short ribs you'll find on their website menu. It was really good. I asked if I could have rice instead of whatever they served it with because who doesn't like rice and roast beef gravy? The server had to go ask and cane back looking very down cast. Apparently I could have it for a $6 surcharge.  My entree ended up coming not only with the rice instead of whatever, but it also included an extra side of rice. There wasn't enough gravy for the extra rice and I'm not a big eater so that was a fail. It really didn't make sense either. Oh well, my roast beef made up for it although my husband was a shade disappointed in his meal. \n\nI can't say I'll want to go back next time we're in NOLA. There are far too many other great restaurants to try.", "date": "2019-02-02 00:22:10"}

So happy it did! We arrived at about 7:45 or so on a Friday night and we were quoted an hour wait.  Due to a reservation canceling, we were seated in 15 minutes. I'll start with the cocktail menu. While the choices were plentiful and it was difficult to pick between exotic-sounding ingredients such as butterfly pea flower tea and old favorites (mezcal), the smoke on the water won out. Twice. One of the best cocktails I've ever tasted, actually. At the risk of incurring judgement I'll admit to having a rum the mules, too, which was very good and the sweet \"dessert\" I was looking for. \nWe split fried alligator, boudin, and the pork cheek with andouille jambalaya to start. We cannot get andouille like that in WI so that dish won out for us. The alligator was good; I wanted to try it because it was alligator and I'm from WI but frankly it was all spicy sauce over a meat that was essentially a rubbery chicken. I don't feel qualified to judge how it was cooked or prepared so I won't. But fellow midwesterners... don't be scared. The Boudin was good; the pickled peppers (onions in reality I believe) were a wonderful accompaniment. \nSmoked ham hock with Hoppin' John. I can't say enough about how good this was. I scraped up every last grain of rice, sopped up the sauce with my leftover bread....and still wanted more. We had also ordered the Mac n cheese casserole and the loaded baked potato. Those two were essentially fillers. I felt the noodles were over cooked but the flavor was good. We both agreed we would have rather had our own ham hock and Hoppin' John plates. As we surveyed the mostly empty dishes, we realized the combination of the latter three dishes was a bit salty. Consider a fresh salad on the menu; betting that would be the perfect complement. \nService was on the slow side, but friendly. The vibe is casual and fun, a bit loud with tables too close together to be intimate.", "date": "2019-02-02 04:42:28"}

For some reason, I always chose another restaurant over it. Well, today was finally the day and I'm glad that it was. I needed a delicious comforting meal and that is exactly what I got.\n\nFor starters, we had the gator bites and fried chicken livers. These were ok. They weren't to die for but they were tasty and a good pre-meal snack. We were starving. So, let's get to the good stuff. I ordered the ham hock with hoppin John, my husband had the rabbit and dumplings and my son had the Louisiana  cochon on cabbage. All of our dishes were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They were all so flavorful and seasoned to perfection. The food was hot and fresh and I just drooled a little reliving that dining experience. It was a flavor party on my tongue. My sixteen year old son said that it was one of the best restaurant meals he has ever had, and we eat out a lot. \n\nIf you are having second or third thoughts about this place, don't.  It is worth the money, the service  was great and the atmosphere was casual and comfortable.  Parking was also easier than we thought. There is ample metered parking and a couple of lots near by. If you are up to it, you could even walk to the riverwalk if you need to walk off all the cochon you just put down. Either way, this place is now on my list for a return visit.", "date": "2019-02-03 00:23:58"}

Although it was lunch time there was absolutely no availability but there were seats at the bar, so we took them. I initially informed the bartender of my food shortcomings and he told me everything that was available to accommodate and the list was long enough for a second comeback if needed (which by the way is so needed) \nI had the oyster and bacon sandwich minus the bacon and a side of Mac and cheese and OMG I want more. The Mac and cheese was not boxed and was baked just right with just the right amount of cheese and flavor..this absolutely didn't taste like restaurant Mac and Cheese...now let's talk about this oyster sandwich that is topped with a homemade slaw and green tomatoes on a thin and crispy amazement of bread - first the sandwich is bigger than me but the consistency and flavor gave me all of my Saturday life and I mean all of it. My spouse had the shrimp and grits, which doesn't have actual shrimp it's a shrimp sauce on top of grits but it's absolutely delicious. Although the shrimp is grounded into some type of paste sauce you can absolutely taste it and it's lacking NOTHING - I will definitely be eating my leftovers and absolutely will be returning \nP.S \nThere is a second side of the restaurant called Butcher and although they are one in the same they are different and each has a different vibe.

It was a 20-30 minute walk from our hotel and it was worth it. Honestly, we wished we went more than once. \n\nWe arrived just before the dinner rush, at about 4:30, and by the time we left at 5:30 it was filling up. So, try and get there just before dinner if you can.\n\nWe shared the Mac and Cheese, Smoked Pork Ribs and the Jambalaya. \n\nThe Mac and Cheese was really, really good. Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of Mac and Cheese, but I had to admit this was great. There is a nice crust atop, which adds a nice textural contrast between the creaminess of the casserole. Honestly, the only thing that I think that could've made it better was if there was a smoked meat product added too, just to add a nice texture and flavor layer. It's creamy, rich, and cheesy. Really good. \n\nThe Smoked Pork Ribs has a very good smokey flavor and the watermelon pickle was a really nice acidic and sweet contrast to the smokiness of the ribs. The only critique I have is I wish the ribs were a little bit more tender/fall-off-the-bone. But if that meant sacrificing flavor, then never mind, because I loved the smokiness.\n\nOur favorite thing though was the Jambalaya. There was a nice blend of spices and textures. I wish that it would've came in a entree size. There was a slightly crispy exterior to it, almost like a fried rice, but the interior of the dish was moist. The meat was crispy but tender - has great flavor. There was a nice spice to it as well. Easily the best starting jambalaya that we had. \n\nAlso, the rolls were really good too. (Haha). They were light and fluffy and the butter was smooth. I could've eaten as many rolls as they would've been willing to bring me. Too good.", "date": "2019-02-22 01:09:29"}

It had strong flavor and is cooked in a way that allows for a crisp crust over the outer portion of the rice. \n\nOther sides included Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese. The Brussels sprouts were probably the least healthy you can find, but absolutely delicious with crispy fried onions to boot. The Mac and cheese was creamy and perfectly cooked as well.\n\nThe food isn't the only highlight. The staff is very polite and attentive. We did not have to wait for a 12:30 lunch either.

The beet salad I had recently was shockingly flavorful and fresh tasting, and last time I came in for dinner I ordered a pork special which came with a pile of roast broccoli that was almost better than the pig.

Pork ribs had a bit too much sauce (for my taste), again with a kick and the jambalaya had good flavor with crispy rice. I had the Louisiana Cochon with cabbage, cracklins and pickled turnips. The meat was tender, but way too salty. I did enjoy our side dishes of Mac n Cheese Casserole and Creamy Grits.

They offer nicely plated (and somewhat more expensive) versions of many Cajun staples, and as someone who loves pork, I tried their pork cheek and sausage jambalaya and their namesake cochon. The jambalaya was pleasantly smoky, with plenty of sausage and pork cheek, although the slightly tough cheek seemed to be a waste of a very delicate cut. The cochon was an interesting ball of smoky pork that was tender but a little dry. This dishes were seasoned well, but could have used a touch more spiciness (easily fixed by their pleasant but otherwise unmemorable hot sauce). I had a refreshing gnarly barley IPA that paired well with the meal.\n\nSevers were very nice. The recommended fried alligator and oysters were good but honestly passable. They serve this delicious bread at the beginning of the meal, delicate but not sweet like brioche. While I feel that this place is a bit more expensive than it needs to be, everything on the menu sounded amazing and everything I tried tasted pretty good. Would consider returning if I was in town again. 4 stars.", "date": "2019-03-13 17:41:57"}

Because we were a large party, we had a fixed menu but it had all the delicious favorites, so we got to experience what I feel is the perfect survey of the menu: fried alligator bites with the perfect dipping sauce that disappeared the most quickly from our table; mac & cheese so creamy it nearly sent me into blissful sleep; the most AMAZING fish!! preparation I have ever had, and this is coming from someone who rarely, if ever, orders the fish entree at a restaurant; plus other delicious things I can't remember. Seriously, I was shocked at how good the fish was & if you are going to get anything, please try that and be as surprised as I was at the most excellent, savory preparation. \n\nIt was a good, solid meal in a perfect setting for convivial conversation, friends & drinks.

I got to sit by the kitchen and watch the line cools work hard. I would give this place a 3.5 stars. First, the service was great. I had the oysters. They weren't nearly as good as the ones you get on Bourbon Street. So if you have a first timer to oysters don't let it be at this place. I will say they were clean. I can't stand to bite into a gritty oyster. Just not too flavorful. Then I tried the gumbo. It was good but I like mine spicy so I added their hot sauce in it and it didn't do much to take it up a few notches. Not a bad thing if you like your gumbo mild. Then I got the ribs. Man!!! They where almost perfect. Unfortunately I mine came out cold!? How is that possible when they are in the fire for a while. Unless they sat underneath the heat lamp, too long. I wish I would have looked because I remember see some setting there for a while. Even before I order mine and mine came out pretty fast so it's possible they gave me the ones setting there for a while. The second thing about these ribs was that they were not \"fall off the bone\" tender. They needed some time. That takes me to my third point this ribs had the potential to be perfect. The sauce is an amazing blend of sweet and spicy. I'm a Texas girl and over here if you need sauce you didn't do it right. So I generally do not like sauce, but this sauce I would ask for more. Finally, I love pecan BBQ so they got that right for me. If you're use to mesquite, pecan is different but it's better in my opinion. But who am I?\n\nOh yeah the Mac and cheese nearly made me cry it was so damn good! Don't leave this place without trying it.", "date": "2019-03-24 00:15:55"}

I had heard of Cochon on previous excursions to N.O., but had never been, so it was truly time. We made reservations weeks in advance and arrived on time and were taken to our table immediately in a full and bustling dining room. Good selection of gins for martinis, made perfectly. And a staff that is there to meet your needs and enhance the food and dining experience.\n\nThe menu is divided into small plates (like fried alligator with chili garlic mayo, yum btw), boucherie (like pork cheek and andouille jambalaya), soup and salad (simple stuff), entrees & wood-buring oven (like rabbit & dumplings), and sides (like macaroni & cheese casserole).\n\nSo first they brought these amazing yeast rolls to us, just like our lunchroom ladies made for us from elementary school through high school in my little hometown school in southeast Missouri. The smell, the soft pillowiness, the fresh homemade hot rolls with butter on the side. I was rocked by these rolls.\n\nThen I could have lived in the \"boucherie\" part of the menu - from the old French, from bouchier meaning \"butcher.\" Only three hot selections: smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle, fried boudin with pickled peppers, and pork cheek (so good) & andouille jambalaya. And a cold plate of meats etc. This was my first \"fried boudin\" - a pork and rice sausage ball (the size of big walnuts fyi) rolled in flour, dipped in egg wash, and rolled in fine bread crumbs, and deep fried. Crisp exterior, soft tasty interior, heaven. I could have eaten a dozen of them or more. Great finger food. That level of quality permeated the other options in this menu section.\n\nEach section had exceptional selections that were, many times, down home favorites but different, better, amazingly delicious.\n\nSo I ended with the butterscotch pudding from the dessert menu. Calling it a pudding does a disservice to the term. Cochon takes this humble child's dessert and elevates it to new heights. It is not soft and so very creamy. It is instead a denser, more pure butterscotch dessert. When you put your fork into it, the fork stands up all by its self. Not hard, just densely packed with flavor. I wish my Mom had been alive to experience this. Sigh. A great dessert, taken to the next level.\n\nAnd that was what I found with each item that we tasted. Each were consistently taken to the next and higher level ... of taste, of creativity, of deliciousness. The logo for the restaurant was that of a pig, and what an exquisite pig it was. Thank you for this total treat.", "date": "2019-04-07 20:19:01"}

I did want to eat alligator, though, and to eat it not just for the sake of eating it but to eat alligator that was prepared well. The reviews on this site gave me the impression that Cochon would be willing to prepare a special vegan meal so we went ahead and made a reservation and requested the meal. \n\nOur reservation was for 5:30, but we ended up asking if we could move it to 5:00 because I was exhausted and needed a nap. They seemed a little put out by that over the phone, though when we got there, the restaurant was empty enough that it didn't seem like it was a big deal.\n\nWe ate outside because this is a meaty-smelling restaurant and because it was in the high 70s. I think the waiter was somewhat disappointed that neither one of us ordered a cocktail, but sometimes you just don't feel like having a cocktail. He also brought out share plates for the appetizer, which maybe was a reflex but we were very clear about the veganosity and alligator is not remotely vegan. For those who want to know, the alligator was very well sauced and delicious, as was the catfish I had as my entree. However. It is not a false statement to say that they prepared a vegan dish, but I wouldn't call it a meal. My heart kind of sank when I saw it, because we'd been walking around all day and I'd ordered an appetizer and a main knowing I needed the calories, but he only ordered his prerequested meal, which is pictured below. It's like 2 knobs of cauliflower, 3 carrots, and 17 decorative beans. Just. Not enough food to call a meal. He said it was a very delicious snack. (I didn't taste it at all because he needed the calories too!) Honestly all they needed to do was slap half a cup of rice under it and it would have seemed much more like a meal. So. The moral of the story is ask more questions about the special meal you request and will pay a little extra for (and I don't object to that; I think if you're ordering off-menu you should pay more, but it should be worth what you're paying).\n\nFinal note: I'm not sure we were offered dessert. Always offer dessert! I'm more likely to want that than a cocktail.", "date": "2019-04-10 00:12:03"}

Our group decided to eat family style bc we wanted to try everything. And I'm so glad we did. \n\nIn order of my favorite to my least favorite (but really they're all my favorites) -\n\nWood fired oysters with chili garlic butter: We ordered oysters at every restaurant prepared in every different way but this was my absolute favorite! The chili garlic butter had a very slight hint of Asian flavor which was something we didn't get at any other spot. The oysters were plump and juicy and I want to dip everything in that garlic butter sauce. We ordered another round of this bc they were that good. \n\nPork Cheek and Andouille Sausage Jambalaya: The best jambalaya I had while in NOLA. It's basically crispy cajun fried rice and the flavors were on-freakin-point. I was upset about having to share this dish with others so I ordered another. \n\nOven roasted gulf fish: Our server told us this was his favorite dish in the restaurant and it did not disappoint. Super flavorful, crispy on the outside moist on the inside. \n\nCatfish courtbouillon: This dish was delicious but not what I expected. It had Asian flavors as well and comes on top of rice. \n\nShrimp grits with Peach hot sauce: This isn't Shrimp AND Grits, but it's Shrimp Grits. They mash the shrimp and fold it into the grits so you get the seafoody flavors in what looks like plain grits. Ugh. So good. \n\nMac and Cheese casserole: Every table had one. Get one. \n\nLouisiana cochon with cabbage cracklings & pickled turnips: Pulled pork dish with a side of fried pig skin. Yum. \n\nBoucherie Plate: Charcuterie. Can't go wrong. \n\nFried alligator: Okay we got this just to say we ate alligator on thurs trip. I think if I didn't know what it was, I may have thought it was white meat chicken nuggets bc the texture is slightly tough but it was prepared nicely and the chili garlic mayo was delicious\n\nAside from the deliciousness of everything,  service was fantastic.

The serving sizes for this place is kinda small so it's nice to just order a bunch of things and just share everything. Except the oysters...everyone should have their own order of the oysters.\n\nOysters- phenomenal! Soaked in their chili and garlic sauce and so tender. I personally love oysters even when they're raw, but this is perfect for someone who wants to try oysters but is iffy about eating it the traditional \"raw\" way. \n\nHouse mac and cheese- this was a side dish, and I'm so glad we decided to order it. It was so ooey and gooey and cheesy just like a mac and cheese should be. Probably one of the best I have ever had!\n\nAlligator tails- I was pleasantly surprised by dish. I love food, but when it comes to meat that not many people really eat especially in Cali, I get kinda hesitant. However, I'm so glad I tried these. I would order it again. It was really crispy and reminded me of like a calamari karage lol. \n\nOverall, this would be on my list of places to go back to when I do find myself in New Orleans once again!", "date": "2019-04-17 22:30:49"}

Pulled pork shoulder pan fried into a patty on top of smothered cabbage.  It was really tender, had great flavor, and was great! I'd order it again! \n\nBraised short ribs 9/10.  Husband ordered this and he really likes how tender the ribs were.  Only downfall was the potato's were over salted. \n\nSmoked pork sandwich (daily special) 8/10 over salted, that's why it was such a low score.  My dad puts extra salt on everything....and these potato chips were wayyyy over salted where even he thought it was too much. He gave chips 4/10, but overall the 8/10 was his final score since his burger was pretty decent.\n\nPan seared drum (daily special) 9/10 pretty good.  Did have a slight fishy taste to it...but that might have been the type of fish.  It was well seasoned, fish was moist and sat on top of grits.\n\nWould definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the area.

Our table was hidden almost under a staircase just in front of stored dry goods, and quite out of the way - the last table in the restaurant. Mind you, there were many other tables available for four people. Service was interesting. Spotty, dis-interested, curt, confusing, and unable to answer our questions about ingredients and dietary restrictions. I understand that menus cannot be changed, and would never ask for that. But I do need to know if there is shellfish/dairy in any of the broths, soups, sauces, etc for allergy purposes. Our cocktails were overly sweet, our waters went un-filled. Bowls of soup/appetizers came with dinner, not ahead of dinner. We felt rushed and for no good reason. My favorite thing was the fried chicken livers - I have to say that those were delicious. But in our party of four - the ham hock was dry as a bone and lukewarm; the beef short ribs were so salty that I felt as parched as a desert dweller. The lima beans were squishy and bland, and also lukewarm. The fresh fish was not too bad actually - you could go with that. Dessert was never even offered.

It's BB King's \"The Thrill is Gone.\" Scale is a problem, and a bigger dining room isn't better for Cochon.  Out? Great cuisine on artful, thoughtful platings. In? Volume sloppiness and overcooked, carelessness.\n\nThey've expanded the dining room, with a huge new annex, but they haven't figured out how to make the kitchen keep up with it. \n\nMy deviled egg gumbo? The gumbo was cold, and the deviled egg plopped into the middle of it was more half-drowned garnish, also cold, that looked like an afterthought. The gumbo was 90% okra, and doesn't hold a candle to Emeril's, even when hot. \n\nThe so-called \"1.5 lb pork chop was almost a pound of fat. I get marbling, but this cut shouldn't have made the cut for service, especially at a lofty $42 price tag. It comes with overcooked green beans, slathered in fat. When fat fat and more fat is all you can do, you've run out of culinary ideas, which is what put this place on the map. \n\nA guy near me orders a dish with a broth, and the runner slops it around as he walks asking where it goes, coating the soup bowl edges with grease that looks disgusting. He hasn't  been trained properly in its handling, but no one cares because the cash keeps coming. \n\nPineapple upside down cake is the recommend from the waiter for dessert? Steaming on the outside, It comes out COLD in the center.  \n\nShort me once, shame on me. I said something. He took a bit off. Appreciated, but this is not the Cochon of old.\n\nWater glass used to always be full. Not now. The manager swoops in and asks how your food is with your mouth full. Old trick. The line cooks at the wood oven are machines. Slapping soullessly dishes into the wood oven with fish slipping off platters and just sitting there on the ashen deck, over-cooking. Drone 2, the tall one, slaps wood into the back to stoke the oven and pollutes every dish in there with ash and wood bits in the oysters!! \n\nThe bourbon at the bar is priced by Ray Charles. High dollar for the ridiculously bad Baby Book, and a huge bargain, $38 for Kentucky Owl Bourbon, which they make in unique bottlings of around 9,000 per uniquely labeled batches, each their own expression. Most restaurants charge $65 to $124 a shot for them because of how hard it is to get them at all, and they are both AMAZING. Unlike Pappy Van Winkle, which is a bogus bottling of far cheaper Weller, that's a real-deal steal! \n\nI've been to this place other than a year or two off, since it opened. It is struggling with profit over quality. I hope that its chef-owners opt for the authenticity that made this the best restaurant in New Orleans for a time.\n\nUnless the kitchen can get the scale right, this place is growing Golden Arches....", "date": "2019-05-03 01:16:01"}

There was no wait but it is preferred if you call ahead of time to see if they are busy or not. \n\nThe place was relaxing. The aroma of the food was as overwhelming and we stood there eagerly waiting to devour the food that we are about to order. \n\nSo onto the food. We ordered the Fried Alligator, Shrimp Cake, Wood Fired Oysters and Mac n Cheese. I like all of them. Fried Alligator was tasty. To be honest, it tastes like chicken but there was something with the seasoning that they used that made it really special. The skin was so crunchy and the size of each one is just right. The plate was good for 2 unless you are like my friends who eat super little and then you can consider sharing to to 2 more. Shrimp Cake here has an interesting flavor to it. Make sure to eat it with the sliced cucumbers that comes with it. I didn't expect anything great from that little pooch of crab meat. It is a must try. The OYSTERS are the bomb. It is a MUST try for me. There were 6 oysters in total and all tasted magnificently. I kinda want to eat it with rice cause rice is life but unfortunately they don't serve rice. Mac n Cheese was okay. Nothing too special. And for dessert, we had blueberry cheesecake!!! It was a good treat!! Not too sweet and the crispy outer layer of it was unexpected. They were able to serve a traditional cheesecake in an extraordinary way but was able to preserve its charming taste.\n\nCustomer service was superb.

Now that I think about it.. it honestly could've been either Cochon or Cochon Butcher that they were referring to, but I'm really glad I got to try it.\n\nFirst off, decor. It was nice, inviting, and warm. The walls were wood paneled with a bar by the entrance, and open kitchen in the back. Big enough to host large groups, but intimate enough for a perfect date night.\n\nI wasn't sure if the restaurant would be packed on Thursday night so I made reservations ahead of time. It was busy, but not super busy where you would have to wait for a while. The service was fine. Our drinks were always refilled and the waitress was informative, and efficient. \n\nWe ordered the wood fried oysters, fried alligator, and ham hock.. all to share.\n\nThe oysters: oh baby. This is something to get here. I've never had oysters like this before. I was somewhat hesitant to order oysters but it seemed like a NOLA staple I had to try and it was the right choice. I mean the oyster itself was fine, but it was the SAUCE that made it over the top. It was savory, buttery with a slight tang from the lemon but all in all a perfect combo.\n\nfried alligator: this was .. ok in my opinion. I don't think they did anything special by frying it, and adding some basil (?) and what seemed like a Sriracha mayo sauce. I think it makes it palatable for people who've never tried it before, but it doesn't highlight the meat at all. Sub it for tator tots and you got a diner dish\n\nHam hock: this was great, just wasn't a personal favorite. Tasted similar to corned beef- salty rich and perfectly tender. The broth that it came in was good, but again didn't fully compliment the meat - but balanced it in a way that didn't make it so heavy which was nice.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Cochon - I just wouldn't add it to my must go to list if I'm ever back in NOLA", "date": "2019-06-29 04:43:51"}

I will preface this by saying I give credit where credit is due. I often will give a good restaurant 5 stars for a great experience. I think this is my only 1 star review ever. Unacceptable service especially due to the price. We were seated and it took at least 15 minutes for someone to come by and even greet us even though they were walking by to adjacent tables over and over again. Once the waitress finally came by, she asked what we wanted. We were in town visiting and never eaten at Cochon so we nicely asked what she thought (aka what is good on the menu, what is popular, how it works since there were many sections to the menu- figured this would be obvious especially given the question she just asked us) and very rudely she says, \"about what?!\" And we're like... uhmm.. what is good? what do people like? She spouted off one thing (the most expensive thing on the menu) and then walked away. We didn't see her the rest of the time we were there. Another waiter finally came by maybe 20 minutes later. We just gave him a list of things from each section that we would share so we could try a few things. The food took a while and was mehh. Mac and cheese tasted like Stouffers with some chipotle powder. The ribeye pie was fine- like an empanada. The oyster and bacon sandwich was okay as well. Nothing special about the food at all. After our food was delivered, we did not see another waiter the ENTIRE TIME WE WERE THERE (other than to pick up our plates and give us our check). Not once were we asked how things were, if we would like anything else, NOTHING. And no, it was not because they were busy because the people that were waiting on us (could not tell you who was our actual waiter or waitress since they each only came by once) were sitting around, leaning on the bar and having conversations with each other. I was livid by the time we left. We would've ordered more because we ended up eating elsewhere after we left but we could not bring ourselves to order anything else here due to the awful service. I truly have never gotten worse service- even from a sport's bars. We don't live in New Orleans but I can promise you, when we do visit, we would NEVER eat at Cochon again. There are far too many better places to eat.", "date": "2019-07-08 14:05:05"}

The dumplings were huge and doughy. \n\n- Smoked Ribs: Very saucy, sweet and slightly smokey. We enjoyed the flavors but it was poorly cooked. The meat was not \"fall off the bone\" but rather tough and chewy. I wouldn't get it again. \n\n- Cochon: Huge disappointment. The pork was extremely dry and salty.

It wasn't as smoky as I had hoped, but it was refreshing, and strong. I ordered the cochon as my main, with a side of greens. It was a tough choice, as the rabbit and dumplings was super appealing and I love a good courtbouillon.

The cochon is huge, smoky, and flavorful. The cracklins and cabbage provide a delicious textural contrast. And the greens are perfectly tender. I ordered the German chocolate cake to-go and that was underwhelming. It was bad, but just compared to how amazing everything else was, I would order an appetizer instead of dessert when I return. \n\nI would also definitely make a reservation to sit at a table.

We walked out letting the reception staff how we felt; they seemed concerned but their excuses were frankly lame and oblivious and lacking any spirit of a sincere apology. We then left but had to return a few minutes later because we left something on our in waited table that we had purchased earlier, only to find they threw our purchase in the garbage.

I am a very picky eater and do not like trying new things that I'm not quite sure what it is however I'm beyond happy that I stepped out of my comfort zone because had I not - I would have greatly missed out. The country ham with peaches and cheese was refreshing, light and eel paired together - they age their cheese for 3 years. The cheese is a spreadable cheese like ricotta.

The alligator bites had good flavor and lightly breaded topped with a delicious sauce - only complaint was from the wife about texture.

Ummm, not good. Service and ambiance is A++ though.\n\nWoodfired Oysters W/ Chili Garlic Butter ($14): there's complimentary bread that you should save to dip into this chili garlic butter sauce (as recommended by our waiter). Sauce wise, nothing new, and it was more oily than flavorful. Oysters were like, abnormally large and plump (there's two osyers in each slot, a giant oyster with a baby oyster), to the point that I almost couldn't eat it because it was filled with sooo much \"meat\" of the oyster. My friend couldn't stomach the fishiness (which is true), so I basically ate all dozen, and after this, I can't look at cooked oysters again. Or oysters in general. SKIP. \n\nFried Alligator W/ Chili Garlic Mayo ($12): first time trying alligator, and it's definitely not as tough as I thought it would be! It does taste like a harder version of chicken tenders, but there's definitely this aftertaste that you'll know you're not eating chicken. Would I eat alligator again? No. But to try, these crispy bites were decent, especially with the spicy mayo (think Japanese spicy mayo slathered on top of some rolls)\n\nLouisiana Cochon ($24): cochon means \"pig\" in French, and since it's the restaurant's namesake, we decided to order this. Well, it's just a shredded braised pork formed into a fat burger patty, with a hint of Chinese flavors (if you've had vinegar pig trotters for a baby's 100 day celebration, that's what I'm talking about). Not bad, per se. But didn't blow me away in terms of flavors, because it was something I already recognized. Liked the cabbage, hated the peaches (in fairness, I just hate cooked fruits in general), and didn't care much for the meat itself.

The atmosphere is rustic and they have a brick oven in the back of the restaurant that you can see from your table. It's beautiful in there. The drink menu offers a pretty wide variety of house made cocktails (my thing) and beer selections (for the hubs). Let me just tell you, the garnishes on the drinks were the reason I selected the ones I did. #notsorry :) We ended up splitting the boucherie plate to start and the smoked beef short ribs for our entree. The boucherie was comprised of a fantastic selection of meats from the butcher and the dressings that were paired made the plate so much more savory. My husband and I were blown away with the beef short ribs. It comes topped with a house-made tomato butter that makes the meat melt in your mouth. The only downside to getting this plate is that I loved it so much, it'll probably be the only thing I ever request! I highly recommend this restaurant for a well rounded dining experience.

Perhaps we got a different type of oyster or the menu has changed but they weren't on the half shell and I probably wouldn't order it again. The rabbit is delicious but the Cochon easily steals the show. The pork was tender, the cabbage was well seasoned, and the peaches were a great touch. The cracklings were fresh and crispy.

Had the fried green tomato version of a BLT. It was slathered with mayonnaise and was really greasy.

This restaurant gets a lot of good reviews but my wife and I couldn't have been more disappointed. First, we were going there for the wood fired oysters. That is what they are known for. I arrived and there are none on the menu despite what their online menu shows. I asked why? They said there was a shortage. Shocking as I have had oysters every day the entire week at average and upper end restaurants. Made no sense plus they should let people know before they get there. Second, I asked if they could make some tweaks to the menu as I was experiencing some GI issues. Response for EVERY item was no - that it was pre-made. Again, I have been in many higher end restaurants in my life and never received a response like this. Even the twice baked potatoes are pre made I was told. Basically, you get what is in the menu and that's that. Also, my wife asked for an after dinner drink. She asked what two of the drinks were and what they tasted like. The second server - they have more than one to serve you - said he had no idea. He came back with two glasses - one that had a small taste and the other that my wife ordered. I thought it was nice that he brought a second for her to taste but when my wife asked about the dessert menu he forgot to bring, he said he was sorry but \"it was hard to score the second drink.\" I thought that was very odd to smash - almost like he was putting in a plug for a bigger tip. My wife got a fish dish and she ate one piece and said it was awful. She wound up just eating the side dish of grits. Oh yes, I forgot they also didn't bring her macaroni and cheese side dish but I wasn't careful enough to see if I was charged.

I love hibiscus so maybe a little biased there. It was a bit frothy on the top though.\n\nThe bread here. Oh my God. Most amazing rolls I've ever had I think. I don't usually like bread and I ate every one of these fluffy clouds. It's how I wish every bread roll tasted : thin crispy glazed top with soft fluffy middle. \n\nOrdered the roasted duck and hot sausage gumbo. It's apparently a new addition, and leans on the cajun style of gumbo according to the manager who spoke to me. He was very friendly. It came with okra which surprised me, don't know if that's typical. It did make the gumbo a bit stickier though.The hot sausage really gave it a nice spicy kick. Unfortunately there weren't as many duck pieces as I'd hoped, but the few that I got were delicious and tender.\n\nAlso ordered the alligator with chili garlic mayo. Made with tenderloin instead of tail which makes it less gamey apparently. And it did basically taste like a spicy mayo karaage. It was a bit heavy with the sauce for my liking but still an awesome experience. Good portion too. Unfortunate it was just me. \n\nWish I came back for a full meal or with more people to try multiple tapas.", "date": "2019-11-09 04:36:56"}

But the service brings my overall rating down dramatically. \n\nI contacted the restaurant a month in advance for my large party (11) reservation. At that time I shared that I would need two accommodations - one vegetarian and one severe peanut allergy. The restaurant assured me that there were special menus for both accommodations and they could serve my entire party. Several hours before my reservation, my party size changed to 12 at the last minute. I contacted the restaurant and asked if they could serve my party of 12 and they said yes- yahoo! I also took this opportunity to remind them that there was one vegetarian and one severe peanut allergy in the party of 12. I was again reassured that those two guests could be accommodated. \n\nWe arrived to the restaurant and were seated after about 5 minutes despite it being a really busy night.\n\nA kitchen staffer consulted with the vegetarian guest and the peanut allergy guest before dinner service started. The guest with the peanut allergy was told at that time that the kitchen doesn't use any practices to avoid cross contamination and since they do use peanuts in the kitchen, it was best not for this person to eat. As luck would have it, I was seated at the opposite end of the long table from my guest with a peanut allergy so I missed this conversation. At one point, maybe at the 2nd out of 4 courses, I noticed my guest with a peanut allergy missing from the table and I eventually find her outside. My guest was getting some air because she wanted to be cautious of the peanut contaminated food that the rest of the party was eating. That's when she told me about the kitchen staffers insight on the lack of kitchen practices to avoid peanut cross contamination. Before this point, a waitress would check in with me to see how the party was enjoying the dinner service. So, I found it odd that the waitress nor the manager nor anyone else with the restaurant came and spoke with me when the restaurant realized they couldn't serve my guest, as promised. After speaking with my guest outside, I went to the hostess stand and explained the above while she looked at me kind of in shock. I suppose it was a manager that walked up as I was detailing the issue and he interjected something to the effect that yes, they weren't able to serve my peanut allergy guest and they wouldn't charge me for her prix fixe plate or the cucumber salad she was served (literally the only thing she could safely eat)- so gracious! The restaurant was only able to serve this particular guest cucumber salad while the rest of the party (vegetarian included) enjoyed a variety of delicious food. Had the restaurant been honest with me from the onset, I would have made reservations elsewhere. \n\nI feel lied to and do not appreciate it especially since I did my due diligence well in advance. I would rather patronize businesses that are candid in their ability to accommodate special dietary needs. With the amount of food and drink my party of 12 consumed, I would have wanted to spend that amount of money elsewhere.  \n\nI would not recommend this restaurant if you or anyone else in your party has a severe peanut allergy.", "date": "2019-12-20 15:39:49"}

In my opinion, the gumbo and smothered greens were the highlight of the meal...delicious! The fried boudin was okay but not sure I'd order it again. The mac & cheese and ribs could have been warmer in my opinion. They also tasted much better after I took them home and reheated them. Either way, I'd definitely order again but will press the issue of ensuring they've been heated enough. The fried alligator was a bit tough and I've had better elsewhere.

When we asked where to go for good alligator meat, he insisted Cochon.

The dish is bite size alligator pieces battered, fried, and smothered in some buffalo sauce like sauce topped with onions and cilantro. It was bit too fried and rich for me to so I put some of their chili infused vinegar. I was more into the vinegar than the alligator meat for some reason... I may start sticking chili peppers into my vinegar when i get home. Really just white vinegar with some dried chili peppers. WOW! \n\nMy friend loved this place. She liked how tender it was and she was a fan of their buttered buns. I didn't have any of the bread, but she said it was good so who am I to really say anything (since I didn't have any). Personally, I was not blown off by this dish and the texture was not as good as other alligators I've had in the past.

We wanted to love this place since this was recommended from a foodie friend, but it didn't quite meet the mark for us. We ordered the fried alligator, duck gumbo, gulf fish, rabbit and dumplings, cucumber salad and Mac and cheese. The fried alligator was good but slightly too much sauce so if you don't eat it right away it can get soggy. The gumbo was different but not my favorite in the city. The gulf fish was by far the best dish we had perfectly cooked light and nicely seasoned. But it didn't come with any starch so the waiter recommended the Mac and cheese and that was a mistake. Way too salty for Mac and cheese and im usually a die hard fan for a good Mac and cheese! That was disappointing. The cucumber salad was refreshing very light to help balance the rabbit and dumpling dish. It's a very hearty dish I would describe it as a rabbit stew with biscuits. \nService: we had 3 servers through out the night and the only one that really stood out and saved us for the night was Gael so shout out to him he knows what he is doing and really turned it around for us. Our main server seemed to forget us after giving us the drinks...the table that sat down after us got served their bread and apps before he remembered to offer us the bread...he actually asked us if we wanted a refill when we didn't get any bread yet! Then the Mac and cheese order was not placed and so came at the end of the meal. The second server asked my husband if he wanted a change in utensils and so we said sure but then he never came back with any utensils....why even ask then? Finally Gael came to our rescue he was super attentive and gave us recommendations on the local whiskey and when we were looking for our main server he came instead to help us with our check and box our food.

Of those dishes, I would only order the braised pork cheeks again--it really did melt in your mouth. The rest of the main dishes were just \"fine\" and the fried apple pie was actually disappointing--it was like something you could buy at the \"fried\" cart at the fair.

This appetizer is a must and will leave you longing for more. For my entree I had the Catfish courtbouillon and it was truly a blessing to my soul. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water, I really need that recipe. They had Brussels sprouts as a special and I ordered it to go along with my meal. It was a sizable portion and had huge chunks of bacon and a touch of heat. Never had spicy Brussels sprouts before but it was a welcome addition to a classic. Since we were going for cocktails and cake after dinner I had to pass on dessert. Maybe one day I'll actually have room for dessert.\n\nThe service was great and our waiter was attentive to our group of 6.

I made reservations well in advance, and I'm glad I did since there was a wait at the door.  We arrived early and were seated promptly.  The server, I think Adam was his name, did a very comprehensive job about recommending drinks even to the point of assuring me that if I did not like the drink I ordered he would definitely drink it for me and get me another.  We had a wedge salad that eats like an entree and split an order of the short rib which was very tender with a mushroom-based broth and potatoes.  Accompanying all this was a side of macaroni and cheese, which the only word I could use to describe it would be \"addictive\".  On top of all that, Cochon also makes their own bread which was also very good; I do insist on getting more of it when offered.  My favorite dish, however, was the duck and sausage gumbo.  The best gumbo I had during my stay in the city.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The desserts were just \"OK\", although I felt I didn't pick the strongest on the menu (i choose the butterscotch pudding).  I misread it and for some reason though bread pudding.

The latter had an incredible kind of light, sweet flavor that perfectly complemented the inherent richness of pork belly. It was definitely the more impressive of the two appetizers we ordered. \nFor our entrees, we ordered the \"Rabbit & Dumplings\" as well as the \"Louisiana Cochon with Cabbage, Cracklins & Pickled Turnips.\" The former was like a rich stew, prepared in a way that greatly enhanced the flavor of rabbit meat, which is usually lean. The cochon reminded us of tender pulled-pork, except with a spicy Cajun flavor. Both entrees were tasty and exceptionally unique. \n\nThe desserts we got were the hummingbird cake was so so, kind of just a regular carrot cake and the butterscotch pudding which was super delicious and soo creamy!!

The food was amazing, probably our best meal while in NOLA for that past 6 days (out of about 12 places).  The place was empty when we arrived (early 5:30), but there was a line out the door when we left.  I chose not to order too much as I was unaware that there was a Cochon restaurant and a Butcher that both carry different menus.  I had may heart set on one of the dishes from the Butcher, which was right next door.  I did however taste every plate that my guests had and ate some appetizers.  I usually go from best food to worst, but the 3 mains were all pretty much tied at #1.  The most unique plate that caused the most eyes to roll back was the Rabbit and Dumplings.  It was a rich and thick stew with no wild taste.  The rabbit just melted in your mouth.  The dumplings were not too doughy and did a good job soaking up the gravy.  The Smoked Beef Short Rib was next and it was fall off the bone delicious.  My friend stated that it was the best rib he's ever had.  The other person had the Oyster/Bacon Sandwich.  I wasn't able to try this due to allergies, but he stated it was amazing.  Huge oysters were falling off and he still had no shortage in the sandwich.  Great value for money.  The sides were a little on the weak side.  The fried alligator was good, but would have been better with a little more sauce.  There were also a few pieces overcooked and dry.  The Fried Boudin was decent, but I've had better.  I gave 5 stars as the setting was cool and the service was spot on and friendly - but most of all the mains delivered.", "date": "2020-03-11 01:16:13"}

Pork belly is my favorite, and it was delicious here. Alligator is weirdly good as well, and I was so happy this restaurant offered their version of it. As an entree we shared the large plate and macaroni and cheese casserole, and I've attached a photo. It was a LOT of food, and plenty for the three of us to share. \n\nOverall, we definitely loved the appetizers here, and I would have loved to have sampled some additional entrees versus ordering the large plate for our first time. I would recommend it as a sharable, though. We left talking about what a wonderful dinner we had, and if you're in the area I highly recommend making a reservation. Definitely get the pork belly and fried alligator!", "date": "2020-10-19 17:43:10"}

Naturally I had to try Cochon.  I had reservations for 12:30 but finished my morning plans an hour earlier than predicted.  Even though I arrived at 11:30 I was seated with no hassle.  I was disappointed that there was no pork belly on the menu, but I got over it.  I considered the wood fired oysters, but after hearing them described I passed.  they sound great, but I confess I don't do spicy and was afraid they'd be too much for me.  \n\nInstead I got the cucumber salad.  It was delicious, but dang--it comes with a bit of chili or chili oil.  Again, it was very tasty but too much for me.  To be clear the issue wasn't the salad, but my wimpy palate.  Even so, I ate more than half before I gave up, panting and weepy.  \n\nThe cochon of the day was a smoked pork chop.  I really wanted to order a side to go with it, but after hearing how big the pork chop was, I doubted I'd have room for anything else.  I was right.  That was a big ol' chop.  It was bone in, served with the jus and  some greens.  \n\nIt was cooked perfectly.  Smoky, tender, moist, with just the right amount of fat.  I don't know how often the cochon of the day changes, or what the different selections are, but I'm sad that my stay here isn't long enough for me to find out.  \n\nMy server made sure that my glass was never empty.  He answered all my questions, even the ones I asked more than once, with confidence and friendliness.

For dinner we split the rabbit and dumplings, and we have to say that it was kind of lame. The rabbit got lost in the rich roux and the whole thing just ended up tasting like your average chicken-and dumplings dish--not bad, per se, but we expected better. Kiddo was happy with her side of mac-n-cheese. The strawberry mousse pie was also unimpressive since the crust was way too thick and hard towards the back and thereby impossible to eat, and the mousse was too airy so the whole thing didn't really work well as a unit.\n\nService was to the point but not particularly warm.

Also, not sure if it was because we were sitting outside but it was a little on the cold side. \n\nMy son ordered Mac and cheese but I did not get to try it. \n\nDue to covid, this was our only New Orleans culinary stop and I am so glad we ended up here.", "date": "2021-01-08 15:17:09"}

Our waitress was warm and friendly and the restaurant is lively and warm.  \n\nWe started with an order of the wood fired oysters.  They are topped with chili garlic butter and are perfect with warm bread.\n\nNext we ordered the rabbit and dumplings and the flat iron steak with cheddar grits and oyster mushrooms.  The steak is flavorful and tender and perfectly paired with the grits.  The rabbit and dumplings are true comfort food and simply delicious on a cool winter evening.  Our son had the mac and cheese and said it was the best he has ever had.   \n\nThe standout though was the banoffee pie.  I didn't think I had room for dessert but after one taste, I made room!  It's a gorgeous banana pie served on a shortbread crust with a layer of dulce de leche and light and fluffy banana cream.

I expected more from a restaurant that had decent reviews. \n\nFirst off, we were seated on the street about 6 inches from the curb. When we requested a table inside (there were clearly at least 3 tables empty) we were told that we could not switch tables. Those tables inside remained empty for the next hour while we got to 'enjoy' the sounds, honks, and exhaust from passing cars during our anniversary dinner. Disappointing. \n\nI ordered the porchetta and while it looked great and was tasty, it had an overwhelming amount of fat. To top it off, one half of it was just cold. The other half was warm. The only explanation I could think of was that it sat at the counter (despite us being told that it would take the longest to cook - didn't think it would also be the longest to sit/wait) in the freezing cold inside (something I did not discover until I stopped in the use the restroom). Again, disappointing. \n\nThe only possibly redeeming moment was when someone roaming the streets began to harass us about sharing some food with them. Our waiter was gracious enough to move them along without causing a scene. That man should get a raise (seriously) since it did not seem like it would have been the first time he's had to deal with something like this.\n\nMy advice: (1) insist on a table inside, (2) bring a jacket, (3) do the calculus so that your dishes all come out at the same time and none of them are cold /sarcasm (seriously, you'd think that a restaurant like this would be able to time their dishes right so that they wouldn't have to sit for extended periods of time; if it didn't sit for long, then perhaps it was the arctic chill that cooled it down so quickly; regardless, keep that in mind).", "date": "2021-05-27 04:09:10"}

This place was pretty acclaimed and regularly busy so we made a reservation a few days ahead of time. We sat outside on the patio. Service was helpful and accommodating with questions, but seemed like they were spread a little thin so had to wait a little longer to get our order in. The pre-meal cornbread is pretty solid and has a nice crusty texture, and it comes with a salted butter that pairs nicely. The wood fired oysters comes with an absolutely killer chili garlic sauce, which is also amazing to dip with the cornbread. Definitely get more bread to mop it all up. The fried alligator bites are really interesting. It's kind of like popcorn chicken, but the sauce and breading elevate it up. The alligator itself is very chewy and overall definitely a really unique dish. The crawfish pie is basically like an empanada. The crawfish itself was not too crazy but the texture of the pie was perfectly flaky and crispy. Three really good dishes for sure. \n\nWe got the cochon special, which for that day was basically a huge piece of pork cooked at different parts - pork belly and skin and chops. It was kind of like a big pork steak, topped with some roasted Brussel sprouts. This thing was really good and unlike any pork I've had. The pork was cooked immaculately, every bite was perfectly juicy and rich. The combination of textures between the crispy skin, gelatinous fat, and juicy meat was like a perfect harmony of pork. This feels like the upper limits of what you can get out of pork. This isn't really necessarily a \"flavor\" or \"seasoning\" type of dish - it's more like a steak in that what makes it good is the quality of the meat and how it's cooked to bring out the taste inherent to the meat itself. \"Let the meat talk.\" This dish didn't blow me away in terms of bite-to-bite flavor but was a very interesting dish in its own right. I just wish it was served or presented in a more accessible way so that it's easier to tackle and eat the different parts more evenly. \n\nWe had the pineapple upside down cake for dessert. The cream on the side is pretty light and tasty, and the sauce is really good. The cake itself is solid as well, with a nice warmth, texture, and balance of lighter sweet flavors. Not terribly memorable but a good dessert for sure. \n\nI don't think I ended up being as floored as Cochon as I was expecting to be but I came away still very full and satisfied. This probably wasn't my favorite meal of our NOLA trip but I think it was the most interesting and inventive. This definitely a memorable meal and certainly worth the visit.", "date": "2021-06-02 17:16:49"}

It's clear why... this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long while! This restaurant advertises itself as cajun and southern cooking, so my second tip after \"make a reservation\" is come hungry! I was definitely nervous when we arrived and saw the upscale atmosphere that the portion size would be small, but was VERY happy with what we were served.\n\nWe were lucky enough to be in NOLA during \"crawfish time,\" and had the opportunity to enjoy a few additional menu items while we were dining at Cochon. My boyfriend chose the crawfish etouffee with Louisiana popcorn rice for his main course. It was rich, and flavorful. There was so much crawfish meat swimming around in the hearty etouffee broth. He was basically licking the bowl at the end because he enjoyed it so much. For my meal, I chose the rabbit and dumplings. I did have to ask our waiter what it was because there was no description on the menu. As soon as he said it's their version of a pot pie, I was sold. The dumplings were perched atop the most flavorful gravy I've ever tried. The meat was tender and paired perfectly with the mouthwatering veggies in the dish. \n\nEven though you are served a TON of food, do yourself a solid and order the mac and cheese casserole. That was the most memorable part of the meal. The crunchy cheese top was like breaking into a creme brulee. The mac and cheese had an awesome cheese blend and tasted like it had four or five pounds of butter in it. It was the perfect side dish. \n\nThe cocktail menu was very long. They had so many different drinks to choose from. It was a tad overwhelming. The bar also featured tons of craft whiskeys. It is definitely easy to rack up a big tab when you're dining at Cochon.", "date": "2021-06-24 21:36:33"}

This was my 2nd time trying it and BOTH times it was phenomenal. I'll start off by saying it is slightly pricey but you honestly get what you pay for! I paid around a total of $117 (not including the tip) for this so I'm yeah lol anyways! Located in the heart area of New Orleans. \nThe gumbo 5/5: The flavor is just so savory and delicious. The chicken and sausage is super tender and mind you, I am not a fan of okra but this one in particular is super soft and BARELY noticeable. The flavor is delicious and I never leave a single drop when I order! Definitely a must! \nThe fried boudin 5/5: This is honestly a New Orleans staple but these are the best dang boudin balls I've ever had. The texture of the ball is so crispy but the middle is super soft. The meat and the rice are perfectly seasoned it's hard to find anything to compare it with and the Dijon mustard dip I believe they give with it adds a nice sour flavor to it.\nThe mac and cheese casserole 5/5: I believe it has onions in it? And I am honestly not a fan of onions but I barely even noticed it was in there! And I have some pretty strong taste buds. The macaroni is nice and soft while the top is nice and crispy and hits you with a sharp cheddar flavor. It's enough to honestly get as an entree! \nLastly we have the smoked porterhouse 2lb pork 5/5: I didn't eat this myself although I think I could considering how delicious it was. The pork has a nice smokey flavor to it and the sauce that comes on top of it has a smokey almost faint wine taste to it? But it isn't anything crazy that takes away the taste of the pork. It really makes the pork even juicer. The pork itself reminded me of a Christmas ham. Except it was super tender and not dry at all. It felt lean honestly. I'm a person who tends to fear too much pork since it usually gives me chest pain if I eat too greasy but this was on point. I didn't even feel full afterwards because I was still down to get some beignets! \nAnyways, if you're visiting New Orleans I definitely recommend trying this place at least once, you will not regret it!", "date": "2021-11-08 22:13:53"}

Prices seem to be on the higher side by NOLA standards, but being from the Boston area, these prices are more what I am used to.\n\nFor food, I had the gumbo, fried gator, and wood-fired oysters. For drinks: the Ramblin Rose and the Elevation.\n\nThe gumbo was pleasant and well-balanced. It had good flavor and spice without overdoing it. Some of the rice felt a little undercooked, but I'm not sure if that's intentional. There was also a small bone in the gumbo (oops). \n\nThe fried gator was a tasty dish as well. It was breaded nicely, and I liked the chili-garlic mayonnaise sauce and other garnishes.  I want to note that some pieces were a little less tender than others, but full disclosure, I'm not sure if that is the nature of gator meat.\n\nThe wood-fired oysters were solid. These were cooked oysters in a buttery and slightly spicy sauce. Not at all bad as far as cooked oysters go. \n\nAs for the drinks:\n\nThe Ramblin Rose was light and refreshing. I could feel the alcohol within, but this drink is not at all spirit-forward. The Elevation, meanwhile, brought some of those spirits closer forward, as well as some smokey and spicy notes!\n\nThe food came out quickly, and the service was kind.", "date": "2021-11-09 17:16:11"}

Highly regarded Cajun cuisine that works with local farms for a large amount of their ingredients. Menu, though not extensive, looked great before our arrival so was looking very forward to our meal. I would consider it on the pricy side, though maybe not for New Orleans. Very personable service throughout our time here. Once seated we ordered drinks and perused the menu. A bowl of delicious rolls with butter arrived shortly. Having just gotten off a plane and not being all that hungry, along with being budget conscious, we chose to order light. Wife ordered the bacon and pork pie and the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar salad. My choices were the chicken & andouille sausage gumbo along with fried alligator with chili garlic mayo. The pork pie was a bit light on flavor-lacking any discernible seasoning or bacon flavor. More bacon would add a lot. The crust was well made and it was cooked perfectly. Cucumber salad had a large amount, IMO, of red chili flakes not listed on the menu. Avoiding them was difficult but she powered through it, pronouncing it \"fine\". My gator was delicious, tasting very fresh and lightly breaded. But for me, as I was expecting, the chili mayo was too much for my palate. Very small bits of sauce added to the flavor but it was easy to add too much. The gumbo was the star of the show for me. Deep, rich flavor profile along with tender veggies and sausage that was flavorful without being too hot. I should really have ordered more of this.\n\nI didn't pay as much attention to our companions' meals as I should have but I did try a bite of the wood fired gulf fish served \"fishermen's\" style that on our visit was redfish. Requested grilled, it had a great seasoning and was very reminiscent, IMO, of a fresh trout, though the person who ordered it compared it to halibut. I didn't think so.  Desserts were a German Chocolate Pie and an Apple Cider donut. The donut was pronounced flavorful by our fellow diners but I never tried it as I was fully involved in our pie. I will say it was not really like a pie IMO as the texture was very firm, not soft and moist like a traditional pie. It resembled to me more of a pecan pie with chocolate and coconut or a 7-layer bar for those who know what those are. Very very good. A really enjoyable meal. I'd come back again for sure.", "date": "2021-11-24 22:59:40"}

We've never had a bad meal from pork (cochon) to rabbit to gator bites to dessert! We are repeat customers!", "date": "2022-01-07 00:19:10"}

I literally can't wait to eat them again. \nThe catfish with grits and charred greens blew my mind. Kudos to this amazing chef.", "date": "2022-01-15 04:49:55"}

The bread was amazing!!!! I loved it and the butter but it came a little too late in my opinion. The service was average. Not going to complain but was far from impressed. As. For an entree I got the fried catfish. That was a mistake. It was so SOUR like someone had squeezed two full limes on top of a finished dish so that was all I tasted. It had zero balance and I even through it was $25+tax I couldn't eat it. I just filled up in bread instead. The greens were horseradish and again hit you straight in the nose. Horseradish and limes.... Gross. The grits were the best part but under seasoned. I mixed it with the bread butter to get it a bit better. I tried some of my friends Mac n cheese as well and thought the roux was gritty and the overall flavor could use a punch up. It was too mellow for me but everyone else loved it. \n\nTLDR: feels like I ate a meal that was A+ by design but was executed by the reserve squad. Great ideas but less than average execution. I should've stopped at the table bread", "date": "2022-01-15 19:28:50"}

The rolls that came out were hot and delicious. We ordered the gumbo, which was very flavorful, but it came out room temperature. After 5 minutes, it was cold. Had to ask to have it reheated. Head cheese board was good, but an acquired taste. The pickles that come with it are sweet pickles for those who are picky about their pickles. Mac and cheese was good, but average. Overall a very average meal for high prices.", "date": "2022-01-15 21:42:37"}
