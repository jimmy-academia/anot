It's the best!  After moving out to the suburbs, it's hard to find anything that comes close.  It's hard to find a thin crust pizza.  Almost all of the places around here are thick crusts and all of the pizzas pretty much taste the same as everyone else's.  Alex's is different.  People mistake the crust and say it's stale and tastes like cardboard, they have it all wrong.  It's what a thin crust is supposed to be.  When I grew up in Manayunk and Roxborough, it was mainly families.  Everyone loved Alex's, it was a \"neighborhood thing\".  There has definitely been a turnover of residents through the years and now you have a lot of young people and people unfamiliar with the neighborhood.  So I'm sure for these residents it's different.  But, anyone will tell you it's the best.  It was always a \"treat\" to get Alex's. When I talk to my friends and family, we always agree there is nothing like Alex's.  I hadn't been there in years because I moved.  A few years back, I introduced it to my family.  My husband and kids love it!  Anytime I am over that way, they're always asking me to bring home Alex's.  I even order it some weekends and drive a distance to there now just because it's so good.  Once you're in the mood for Alex's, nothing else will do.  The staff is always so friendly and has always been.  When I walk in there to pick up, I feel like I'm home again, that's the best feeling.  People who expect them to sell other foods, get over it.  It's pizza, it's what they do best and that's it.  I guess for those of us who grew up there, we always knew what it was like and we know what to expect.

I spent many weekends of my youth eating Alex's pizzas and even now still enjoy having a pizza from here.  One funny story about Alex's pizza is that when I was a toddler, at one time, I wouldn't eat my pizza without candy on it.  So, my uncle threw a bunch of gummy bears on the pizza and we ate it like that.  Apparently, according to my uncle, it wasn't bad.  I don't remember this experience as it has been many years but maybe, just maybe, I will recreate this gummy bear pizza one day. \n\nThey are located on the corner of Leverington Avenue and Pechin Street where you will see a very small set of steps leading down to the entrance of the tiny pizza shop.  There is one table in here as their main method of food service is takeout.  The employees are friendly and I even noticed that one of the employees has been there throughout my entire experience here.  The pizzas are made right in the front of the shop, so you can watch the process of other pizzas being made while you pick yours up or wait for it.  Over the years, the ownership changed more than once, I believe, and the pizza flavor and texture changed with it.  At some points along the timeline Alex's Pizzeria had their downsides but I believe they are back on their feet as my girlfriend and I enjoyed their pizza the last time we had it.  The hard part is keeping their pizza hot when driving from their location to my current home location.  If you don't live close, plan to eat in the car or bring one of those bags that keep your food warm in the car.\n\nOverall, I have been a fan of Alex's Pizzeria my entire life and plan to keep coming back for more of their pizza.

I live right around the corner from Alex's, so after driving past it every day, I figured I'd give them a shot after my fail with Roma's Pizza on Ridge. \n\nThey have no website and no menu. After calling, I learned that they only offer pizzas - no wings, breadsticks, or anything else. JUST PIZZA. A little disappointing because I was craving wings, but I guess they stick to what they know. My favorite type of pizza has everything on it, so I asked for nearly all of their ingredients - pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, mushrooms, black olives, onions, and peppers. It ended up being over $20 because you pay by the topping! Totally ridiculous.... AND when I walked in ready to pay with my credit card, I am told it is CASH ONLY and am directed to the nearest ATMs instead of getting my pizza. Why on earth would you not tell someone this over phone when they order?!?\n\nThe only redeeming factor was the quality of the ingredients. They were fresh and delicious, especially the sausage, which were sliced sausage links instead of the little sausage bits/balls. \n\nHowever, they piled too many ingredients on one pizza. I used to work at a pizza place in high school, and the more ingredients you add, the less of each you are supposed to use; otherwise, it will get too heavy, and the dough can't support the weight of the toppings. While the cost trade off was there ($20 for a mountain of toppings), I had to eat the pizza with a fork and knife because the dough was not thick enough to hold it all. Also, the dough ended up getting soggy by the time I got it home, since I had to run to the bank on Ridge to get cash to pay.\n\nOverall, good quality ingredients, good location to my house (two blocks away), but poor advertisement, which does not make it condusive for new customers.
