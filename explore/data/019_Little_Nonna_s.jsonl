This small Italian restaurant is snuggled in between two businesses. They offer both indoor and outdoor dining.  They are very prompt with seating their guess who either has reservations or who doesn't have reservations. Once I got here I was seated properly by my server Connor. Connor was very knowledgeable of all the wines that were offered as well as the full menu. He introduced the special for the week which was the seven fishes special which was a three-course meal that introduced seven fish dishes. I was totally intrigued and I took him up on his offer. The feast is an annual 6 day long special menu (regular menu available as well). I ordered the red wine that was simply amazing. It was very smooth yet tight towards the end. The bathrooms are really clean, and they are well decorated with priceless pieces of art. The feast of the seven fishes consisted of the olive & smoke salmon crostone, the fried cod, the grilled octopus, the shrimp scampi with the baccala mash were all incredible. The code shrimp salad was simply amazing. While the grilled octopus was cooked to perfection. If you ever find yourself in Center City wanting some authentic Italian cuisine please check out little Nonnas and please tell them that SHIMMY sent you and ask for my good friend Connor!", "date": "2022-01-16 13:51:42", "user": {"name": "Julian", "review_count": 103, "yelping_since": "2014-10-14 04:39:04", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.25, "fans": 10}}

Nice shrimps, if I do say so myself.\n\nAll in all, great value, great food, great date with my boyfriend. \n\nIf you are looking for strong Italian cuisine and a night with your significant other you won't forget, do yourself a favor and come here with some wine.

Music at a comfortable level.\nOur server was over to get us water as we reviewed the online menu with the QR scan. You know the drill by now.\nOur server was pretty stiff. No smiles and if I'm being honest, I felt sort of rushed. When we put in our drink order (cocktails), she asked if we knew what we wanted for our appetizer and our meals. We had just arrived a few minutes earlier, and we had hardly settled in, so the plan was a cocktail and then order an app, and then decide on meals, but we went ahead and ordered the appetizer and our meals together. \nThe Charred Broccolini Caesar was just fantastic. Great crunch of textures from the greens and radicchio and those warm polenta croutons were quite sinful. \nMy wife ordered the popular Sunday Gravy meal and I went with the Steak Tagliata (hanger steak). Cooked one way (rare) and it was quite good. Had some unique mushrooms as a side (not listed on the menu) and a few fingerling potatoes, which were quite boring. The arugula and shaved parmesan was refreshing and that aged balsamic was a nice marinade. \nShort rib was the highlight of that Sunday Gravy. I'd prefer a spaghetti over the pasta they used for the dish. It was the type I would normally prefer for a mac and cheese and not this sort of meal. \nFor dessert, we had the tiramisu and it was a good portion for us to share and had a nice cup of coffee too. \nIt was a pleasant meal and a cute space, but not sure I'd be rushing back anytime soon.

Nice interior dining with glass (I believe?) dividers between every table which is a nice touch during the next phase of the pandemic. My on-again off-again partner and I had the panzanella as an appetizer. It's basically croutons, peaches, veggies, and leaves. I personally didn't think it was anything special and looked like something I could make by throwing a couple ingredients around. I prefer more complex food with different textures but I did like the honey roasted peaches. I could barely taste the extremely thin sheets of parmesan. \n\nWe ended up sharing the Campanelle Nero which is squid ink pasta with shrimp and breadcrumbs. I thought this was very tasty and was happy with the flavors combined with the crunch from the breadcrumbs. My partner and I thought it was enough for the two of us that night but if you're really hungry I could imagine it's possible to eat the whole thing yourself. I would probably recommend this dish to anyone coming for the first time. \n\nI should also add the waitress brought 2 plates out before bringing out each course which was nice and made it easy to share. She also replaced all silverware after each course so there was no peach residue in my squid ink. She came around a good amount and seemed thoughtful which I appreciate. \n\nFor dessert we had the tiramisu which was delicious as well. Another item I would recommend. \n\nAll in all, a good experience which I didn't expect that night since I'm a tough critic.

It was decent but nothing special in my opinion. I do think we went wrong by ordering takeout, so I would give this place another try but in person.\n\nWe got the Chicken Parmesan, Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the Broccoli Rabe. All of these were extremely salty and my mouth was so dry after eating. If I am in my 20s and think that there is too much sodium... something is not right. Both meals were portioned nicely, enough for me to have some for lunch today. I was not a fan of the Broccoli Rabe it tasted like the vegetables had not been cleaned but my boyfriend disagreed and really liked it. Unfortunately, I don't think this place is very authentic and it does not taste like they make their own pasta. But then again I don't think many places do anymore.", "date": "2021-08-04 16:21:54", "user": {"name": "Angela", "review_count": 13, "yelping_since": "2020-01-06 03:41:25", "elite": "", "average_stars": 4.15, "fans": 0}}
