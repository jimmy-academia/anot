What more do you want for a quick meal? I think the owner just died which is really sad. I'm not sure how staff will change so just a lookout for that. If anything happens, you never know. Might stay the same. \n\nLarge menu, seating and an ATM. I think they take plastic ps btw. That's a plus. I know their ATM was broken the last time I was there though.

Ahem.  The strombolis and hoagies must be great because the pizza is only advisable when one is desperate (which includes the pizza-craving stupor we're in when the bars close).  I don't know, somehow the genuine-prepared-in-advance-frozen-crust doesn't really complement the ketchup that they use for sauce.

The pizza is ok, the strombolis are ok, the subs are ok, and the salads are pretty standard.  They have a large menu, but do not offer pizza by the slice.  They have delivery, but I only lived 2 blocks away and didn't want to be that lazy...    The pizza is Greek style - thicker crust, smaller slices.  All in all a great place if you don't want to spend a lot of money but still want good food.
