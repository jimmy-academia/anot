We didn't have a reservation, but thought we would just walk there and see if we could eat. The hostess gave us in our opinion the best seat in the house, a little table right next to the open window wall. She told us we needed to be done in 45 minutes because that's when the next reservation for that table began. We tend to eat fast, so that was no problem for us! This place is very small and cozy, with dim lighting. It's a nice date spot! Our waitress was great to begin with, but forgot about us after our food was brought out. We decided to order 2 pizzas and share them. My husband ordered the spicy sausage and had the caramelized onions omitted on his half. I ordered the spicy soppressata and he asked for the honey to be omitted on his half. I appreciate them allowing you to make small alterations, and not pulling the \"chef created this to perfection\" card. Each pizza was $17, which seems about right for the quality and charm of the place! Our pizza was brought out in under 10 minutes! A food runner brought the pizza, not our waitress and we were out of water and it was clear after 6-7 minutes she wasn't coming back anytime soon, so we had to ask another waitress for a water refill. She must have told our waitress because she cane back with water and apologized. After she apologized, we were fine, didn't hold a grudge. Our pizza was so delicious! The pepperoni was so crispy and paired perfectly with the honey! My husband's sausage pizza was also very good! I felt like it was missing acidic and textural elements though. It needed a little lemon or vinegar and something on top for a little crunch. But overall, very excellent! We finished in about 35 minutes and we're just waiting for our waitress to come back so we could ask for a box and the check. She finally came back after another 7 minutes. We were getting nervous because we didn't want to screw over the hostess who let us take the table. When she brought the bill we had our card out and ready for her to take. By the time she brought it back, we had gone over the 45 minutes. There aren't very many tables, this place is very small and they seemed to have a handful of waitress/waiters in addition to food runners, so we're not sure what caused our waitress to be aloof after we ordered.

Their pizzas are absolutely delicious too. Would highly recommend the spicy soppressata (we ordered a spicy sausage instead but glad this one came instead). They were very liberal with the toppings which I appreciate and compared to the sausage, the meat just covers more surface area. I came in two Wednesdays ago and there were 2 large parties that had made reservations :( Luckily, there were 5 spots at the pizza bar and my party of 2 fit cozily there. I didn't even know there was a pizza bar and it was so nice that we got to see how the pizzas were made while enjoying them ourselves! I really liked that aspect and it was farther away from the window where there was hot air coming in the restaurant. The restaurant is a pretty small space, but their service is very quick, waiters and waitresses are very prompt and attentive. Would highly recommend that you try this out for SIPS and maybe I'll even be back to try them when it's not just SIPS :) Keep up the good work Nomad!
