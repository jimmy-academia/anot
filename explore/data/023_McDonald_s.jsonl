First off they're always closed. It's literally been a long time coming with this review. I live about 4 blocks away so when I say they need to SHUT IT DOWN LITERALLY SHUT IT DOWN! THE STAFF IS ALWAYS RUDE, SOMEBODY ALWAYS HAS AN ATTITUDE! What broke me today and brought me here after yearsssss, here are how my last THREE VISITS went \n\n1.) I pull up the manager is yelling stop we closed, I'm looking at her like she's joking I'm like huh what do you mean why are y'all closed? She goes \"I have no staff, nobody showed up\" Like I understand you can't work yourself but always coming to McDonald's between 9-10 and they're always closed is it because staff isn't showing up? \n\n2.) I pull up start ordering, the workers are literally laughing playing around where I had to repeat my order 4 TIMES! Like pay attention I understand they might be young but you have a job to do, might I add one you're getting paid for so do it! Management seemed to not care, my order was wronG AND COLD! Fries were so bad like they hadn't changed the oil bad after taste. \n\n3.) TONIGHT! Now I pulled up to order a snack Oreo McFlurry so this literally just happened and her name was Asia - I go to order we are out of Oreos (okay that's fine, I'll just add my own Oreos) can I just get the ice cream in a cup? She goes no I'm like huh well can I get a snack size m&m mcflurry with the m&ms on the side (which I have done multiple times by using the \"ask me\" tab WHICH BY THE WAY IS FUCKING ALLOWED ITS FUCKING MCDONALDS! she kept telling me she couldn't do it , her manager refused at this point I'm so frustrated I leave because WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A PROBLEM?????? WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE A PROBLEM HERE!! \n\nLiterally throw the whole staff away, and get new management, and maybe a new owner because this shit is horrible!
