Once paid you will get a number to place on your table. With this number system I'm not sure if it was for the staff to bring you your food or for you to pickup once your food is ready. I saw both scenarios happening when I was there. \n\nThe menu:\n-The menu is substantive and has many options for different dietary restrictions. \n-There are a few parts of the menu which are confusing since they seem similar with other menu items, however the person behind the counter was able to clarify easily for us. \n-We noticed this after, but there is a printed menu available at the counter, not only the one above the counter as we had thought.\n-There is signage at the counter indicating that due to rising costs, all prices will be increased by 5% from what is stated. However checking in on Yelp yields a 5% off purchase coupon.\n\nFood:\n-The portions are huge and easily shared\n-The pita is made to order and very delicious \n-Everyone in the group enjoyed their order.\n-The bakery's menu looked delicious but sadly most items were out of stock. \n\nWith all the positives listed above, you may be wondering why the three star review.  The bathroom was absolutely filthy and disgusting. I am hoping it's due to a fluke but it was bad enough to dock a star. Upon future visits If the situation improves I will update my review. \n\nAdditionally the whole numbering system is frankly confusing. Some of us had our food brought to us. Others had to keep looking at the area where food that was ready to see if our order was there.  The restaurant was not busy so we were unsure what the deal was. This resulted in loss of a star since the last person in our group to get their food, where the rest of the group was already midway through theirs. This resulted in the loss of another star. \n\nOverall I would give Manakeesh another chance and also would love to try their bakery. I hope they take the feedback and address it. \n\nThings to know:\n-It will be easier to look and order off printed menu versus one displayed above counter\n-Indoor and outdoor seating available\n-Pay attention to food that is ready to be served, your order may be stuck there if you are waiting for it to be brought to you \n-Guest WiFi available \n-Come prepared with hand sanitizer to wash your hands versus using the bathroom. And do your best to avoid having to use the restaurant restroom. You will thank me later. \n-Cutlery, napkins, and water are self served.  However the water cups are TINY (like 4 sips) so be prepared to refill often or (what I recommend) bring your own refillable water bottle/cup. \n-Street parking only\n-There is a small section stocked with different items such as honey, Turkish delight, nuts, candy, etc. \n-Manakeesh has their own app for you to place delivery orders and get discounts from", "date": "2021-06-26 12:37:04", "user": {"name": "Manta", "review_count": 71, "yelping_since": "2010-05-04 22:47:11", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.78, "fans": 0}}

No seriously. I would. \n\nWhy I am leaving this review now is because in the last 2 years or so their service and quality has deteriorated a lot. They are now almost always late with their food orders. Absolutely rude and unapologetic about it and frankly do not care. The Manakeesh I knew used to warm, soft, caring and really welcoming. The quality of food is also now just okay. \n\nThey are still one of the better lebanese fast food restaurants in Philly as not a lot places are as authentic with their flavours as Manakeesh is. Their menu also is very representative of Lebanese cuisine so full props on that. \n\nPlease improve your service, start caring more and really no other middle eastern cuisine serving restaurant would be able to compete with you! \n\nTL:DR - Service sucks.

Why three times, instead of my usual pre-review requirement of two? Well...in spite of all the other adoring reviews, and in spite of the fact that Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine is my favorite, I just wasn't having great luck with my orders, until this past Friday. \nSo let's start with the best, and work back to most disappointing;\nOn Friday I ordered a grape leaves wrap for dinner. I knew that I really liked their stuffed grape leaves (or, as known by their Greek name, dolmades) and how can you go wrong with fattoush salad (hold the onions!) and baba ghanoush? Well, they forgot to hold the onions, but they did call me not 5 minutes after my pick-up to apologize and offer to replace the whole meal. I told them not to worry, and I was glad I did (the onions were few and easy to pick out anyway). It was a really great wrap, and a perfect portion. Flavorful and filling, but not too much so. My partner got the falafel platter, which he really liked, but the massive hummus portion packs a punch - you might not want to finish it in a single sitting. \nSo I knew I liked the stuffed grape leaves thanks to the ma'ali platter. That was from visit number two. Sadly, that was the only thing I completely enjoyed from that meal (which I shared with my partner, together with a cheese manakeesh). The fried cauliflower, eggplant and potatoes were tasty enough, but so loaded down with oil that I really didn't feel great soon after. As for the cheese manakeesh...I just don't get it. What am I missing?\nMy first visit was the biggest disappointment. I ordered the cheese and spinach manakeesh. The spinach was so briny I could barely eat it. I guess I was expecting a more Greek-style cheese-spinach blend, and this was not that. I mean, I love pickled cucumbers, but Manakeedh goes super heavy on vinegar and pickled foods, at least on everything I've had.\nNot the most glowing review, and it really feels more like 3.5 than 4 stars, but I gave the full 4 because the service is great, very quick, friendly and mindful, and everyone else I've gone with has really enjoyed their food. I'm really tempted to try one of their vegetarian savory crepes, but I'm not sure yet if there will be a fourth visit.

My husband and I walked up to the register and the employee behind the register motioned to help us- My husband noticed one of the cooks baking something behind her and asked \"oohh what is that?\"  (and okay it was a little loud because of the heavy cooking going on) BUT- there was a microphone in her face and she said something and we couldn't hear her- so she said once more- and lastly again but she screamed at us \"BACON STEAK\"- LOL i felt like she was going to beat us up- I thought this place was halal? also okay well shove your bacon steak up your you know what...
