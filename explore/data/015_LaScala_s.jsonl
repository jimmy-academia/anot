We weren't bothered since the weather was nice and they had patio heaters, it was a nice ambiance. We ordered a 5 cheese pizza and Philly Cheesesteak calzones however, only the pizza was good.

I didn't even eat any of the Italian Wedding Soup I ordered as I was just stuffed.\n\nMy coworker and I came here after the new grand \"reopening.\" LaScala's Fire has been open about a week and used to just be LaScala's. In these COVID-19 times, we were upset when they closed thinking it was for good. Thank God it wasn't!\n\nLaScala's Fire has a very easy to use online ordering website and I used it without any difficulties to place a pick-up order. I love how with certain items they move into sub-menus for extra add-ons or take-aways. The price adjusts accordingly for the add-ons. After placing your order, they give you a time it should be ready and it was!\n\nThe Alicia's salad was nothing much in way of the salad itself. Greens, chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, but I added some calamari which upped the game, and the dressing they kept to the side. However, the gigantic sphere of a meatball with a huge amount of ricotta and red sauce was almost a meal in itself. Perfectly cooked with an almost crispy outer rim, juicy inside and so much flavor. Mixed with the ricotta was perfect. I was not the biggest fan of the red sauce, but everyone has their preferences. \n\nThe fried calamari came back to work a little on the soggy side, and they were too salty for me. Next time I'll try at the restaurant itself and I bet they'll be better. Most of that came home for someone else in the family to enjoy.\n\nLastly, dessert was so decadent. The zeppoles were perfectly fried dough balls in powdered sugar with an outstanding cannoli cream over them. Then, to somehow make them even better, a raspberry dipping sauce. OMG. \n\nMy coworker really liked her chicken Caesar salad that she added bacon to. Couldn't finish it but did chow down on the nice grilled chicken. Had to save room for the zeppoles! \n\nLaScala's Fire also looked awesome inside in gleaming white and has plenty of seating. The staff were using all COVID-19 precautions. We inquired about a luncheon and they said they are taking things day by day as the rules seem to change by the second in Philadelphia. However, they can accommodate.\n\nThe online ordering menu allows for a tip to be added, and you pay with credit. $67 for everything including tax and tip - 2 salads, soup, calamari, and zeppoles! I'll definitely be back to try the pizzas, paninis, Stromboli, calzone, some other starters, and their favorites.

At one time, it was a go-to restaurant for me. The atmosphere, food, and service was great. Now, I'm giving 1 star for service, and 1 star for the apps. What's good... the service. Our waiter was Kenardi, and LaScala's is lucky to have him. He's the only reason the experience didn't end up being a disaster. He's very attentive and friendly. The food... The bread and oil dip is excellent. The appetizers we had was pretty good (White Pear Pizza, especially ) and Im glad because we sent back 2 entrees. Both were chicken pasta dishes. The chicken was literally boiled in water and thrown on top of noodles, it was absolutely flavorless, the sauce was just as bad... it was like eating cardboard topped with chalk. Both dishes were really terrible. I couldn't even dress it up. Use the seasoning rack, dammit! The atmosphere is confusing. They have candles lit on all the tables, but what mood is that setting when your customers under lights bright enough for a broadway show. Also, they don't pay attention to seating. The restaurant was pretty empty, so sitting adult parties next a table with 3 screaming kids wasn't very thoughtful. I think it's unfortunate the way LaScala's has changed. It's not hard to get it right, you just have to pay attention, and put the effort in. Prior to this visit, it has been a long time. I'm not gonna say I'll never go back, because I'm really hoping this was just a bad night, and I can still count on one of my old favorite restaurants.

First, the restaurant was supposedly open based on the hours posted on the door, but when I walked and tried to open, the door was locked.  The irate attendant came and slowly opened the door.  It seems like they are upset about having a customer at 11:30 am.  Their hours stated they are open starting 11 am.  So I was confused.  I was seated to a table and after ordering my drinks and my entree.  I got the bread, which is probably the best part of my meal.  I ordered the veal with linguine which was very average tasting.  I ate some and packed 80% of it.  On my way out,  I saw a homeless man and gave my leftover meal to him.   I don't think I will ever come back to this place.", "date": "2018-11-05 17:53:27", "user": {"name": "Kirstie", "review_count": 140, "yelping_since": "2012-03-29 19:29:38", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.71, "fans": 5}}
