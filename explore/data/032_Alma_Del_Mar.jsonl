What a great experience! \n\nServers were very friendly and nice. If you go for brunch \"early\" think like 1030AM, there was NO ONE there which was great. We sat outside which was nicely decorated. Very spacious. Good menu choices but not overwhelming. We had the breakfast burrito and the tres leches bread (\"pan\" on the menu). Fantastic! The refried beans instead of rice in the burrito was really great and kept it from being dry. And the home fries were great too. The pan was delicious. Not overly sweet honestly, although it was quite a large helping of food. Fresh strawberries and pecans finished it off nicely. I also had a mango lemonade which was nice and not overly sweet. \n\nPrices were reasonable, service was quick. Whats not to like! Finally a place that does brunch just differently to make it feel familiar yet better than many other brunch experiences around here. Check em out! And go early, because it does get super crowded later.

Tucked away between Italian market stores, this place has both indoor and outdoor seating options. My friend and I came on a chillier day and it wasn't too bad sitting outside since it's tented and has individual heating stands. The staff were welcoming and quickly showed us to our seats. I loved the extensive menu that covers all day meals from breakfast to dinner. We ended up sharing a few items including guac and chips, calamari tacos and lobster benedict. We had come during the day time and it wasn't terribly packed but in terms of service time, the food did take quite a while to prepare. We got our guac and chips and finished the whole serving of chips, got a refill of chips and almost finished that, all while we were having more lengthier casual conversations, before we got our other foods. The guac was really refreshing though, though a bit chilled. As for the calamari itself, that was really yummy and had a nice batter ratio. It didn't necessarily need the taco piece of it though as the two didn't quite fit together. For the benedict, the lobster was a bit dry and tough but otherwise can't go too wrong with lobster.

Food is a solid 4-4.5/5 and the service is a 5/5.\n\nThere were so many items on the menu we wanted to try, so we opted for ordering a bunch of things to try, versus any entrees. We ordered the grilled kale salad $15, crab and corn chowder $10,  grilled cauliflower $13, elote $4, calamari $18, and had the pineapple water $3. In total our bill came to $69 before tip and we both went home with 2 full boxes of leftovers. \n\nThe crab and corn chowder was flavorful, and full of crab. The grilled kale salad was delicious with the char, but slightly overdressed, the shrimp was good. The cauliflower was delicious, loved the salsa rosa and salad that it came with and the portion was lovely. The elote was one of the best I've had, get it. The calamari had such a nice light batter and was well fried and seasoned. Our server forgot our pineapple water, and kept apologizing and was so kind through our night. The pineapple water brought me back to my travels in Central America, would definitely recommend, it will ship you straight to the tropics. Also, since we shared everything - I figured they would bring us 2 spoons for the soup but they divided the portion into two bowls which was so thoughtful and cute. Lastly, at the end of our night we were brought out flan for dessert on the house. Also *BYOB* no corkage fee!\n\nApparently they were also featured on queer eye, I had no idea. But I loved the food, the service, and the happy smiles of the lovely staff at this family owned restaurant. I would definitely recommend a visit and I can't wait to go back to try some actual entrees!

They put a big tent that provides nice coverage when it rains. When it gets darker at night they turn some lights on. \n\nServers were friendly. I ordered the tamales with crabmeat. It's served without the corn husks. Nice presentation with some cooked greens underneath the tamales. Fresh cornmeal, perfect flavor. Highly recommended.\n\nMy usual is the mango salad. It has good amount of mango and crab meat. Dressing is awesome, not too sweet or too acid because you already has the sweetness from the mango.\n\nTiramisu is a nice dessert with strong coffee flavor. \n\nThe small flower arrangement on each table is a nice touch for the dining area", "date": "2020-09-11 09:21:44", "user": {"name": "Retna", "review_count": 655, "yelping_since": "2015-11-02 22:00:00", "elite": "2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.4, "fans": 48}}

Finally decided to have a meal outdoors during this crazy time and Alma Del Mar was exactly what i needed. Tables were spaced outdoors and nicely spaced out. Because their dining area was quite big, I did not feel crammed nor did I have to deal with sidewalk seating. \n\nI ordered the crab mango salad and it was delicious. I embarrassingly inhaled the thing. I don't even love salads and this was just SO good. I also had the strawberry french toast bc carb is LIFE! Very good as well and just the right size that it wasn't overwhelming.\n\nI would definitely recommend.", "date": "2020-09-10 19:18:58", "user": {"name": "Ann", "review_count": 488, "yelping_since": "2007-11-14 14:28:12", "elite": "2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016", "average_stars": 3.59, "fans": 38}}

Went for brunch on a weekend, my partner and I had only just decided that morning we wanted to try out this new spot and got reservations day of. The outdoor dining is so adorable, the staff is incredible, my mocha oat latte was made PERFECTLY (I've been a barista for 7 years so I do not say that lightly), and our meals were absolutely delicious.

As you can see from my photo I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was very VERY good ! I went with a few friends and we brought a few bottles of champagne since it's a BYOB which we love , and they were extremely accommodating.  They kept our champagne on ice and brought out an ice bucket to keep everything cold, our server was a younger man and very nice and attentive.  The food is extremely reasonably priced and I really love the atmosphere it's right in the heart of the Italian market .
