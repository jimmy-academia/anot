The place was already buzzing with activity with most of the tables filled with dinner guests. The service was impeccable with our BYOB wine being uncorked, water glasses filled and a basket of fresh crusty Italian bread with dipping olive oil arriving at our table within minutes of being seated. The menu is extensive with many interesting Italian specialties. Only a seasoned chef can handle so many wonderful dishes on a daily basis! In most eateries a couple of these dishes would be offered only as the dinner special. So, we started with Polipo Fantasia which is grilled octopus with capers, pur\u00e9ed ceci beans and sun dried tomatoes, finished with olive oil and balsamic glaze. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the pur\u00e9ed chick beans was fabulous. Not a humus but a delicious dipping sauce. A second appetizer plate was Calamari Fritti which is traditional fried calamari but these were served in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. A really great mixtures of flavor between the sweet & spicy but adding to the explosion of flavor were the fried calamari. The calamari were crisp, tender and not chewy or greasy! The final appetizer plate was Antipasto which is Chef Tony's selection of an assortment of Italian specialty meats, cheese, and vegetables that included thinly sliced soppressata, salami, prosciutto, provolone, pecorino and mozzarella cheeses, pickled eggplant, roasted peppers, fresh and sundried tomatoes...yep another culinary delight! Some in our party had eaten here before and knew their go to pasta dish was Fettuccine Pugliese that's squid ink fettuccine with shrimp and crab meat, served in a cheese bowl with white wine sauce. I tried Gnocchi Mascarpone con Aragosta which is mascarpone gnocchi saut\u00e9ed with lobster and typically finished with a touch of tomato and cream, but I skipped the tomato and cream and the Chef accommodated my request for an arrabiata sauce. Each gnocchi was stuffed with a dab of mascarpone and cooked to perfection! For my taste the lobster in arrabiata sauce was heaven! All four pasta plates were sparkling clean from our \"scarpetta.\" The dinner was topped off with espressos and orders of strawberry and hazelnut gelatos!

We ordered the caprese salad to start, which was their special of the night. The mozzarella and tomato were flavorless. If you've ever had fresh mozzarella, and I'm talking FRESH, the taste is a creamy melt in your mouth goodness. This was not it. We ordered another special of the night that was even worse than our starter; the veal was gray, slathered with a white gelatinous sauce--a texture that suggested the sauce might have been canned. We also ordered the Antonio pizza, which is topped with prosciutto, arugula, and oil. It was the driest pizza I've ever eaten. Giving them one last shot, we ordered the pistachio cake for dessert. The pistachio cake seemed to be an angel-like cake with cannoli filling. On brand with the rest of our meal, the pistachio cake left more to be desired; it simply lacked flavor.

It's rare to find a restaurant with both authentic, incredible food AND fantastic, thoughtful service. I was the first to arrive out of my party. My two friends were running 30 minutes later than our reservation, so I was nervous that, because the restaurant is pretty small, we would lose the reservation. But the host chatted with me and kept my wine glass full until they arrived. Our waiter, Julio, was so charismatic and provided great recommendations. The Melanzane Involtini (the eggplant appetizer) was absolutely delicious, and we ended up all splitting a dessert (I wish I remembered what it was called - some sort of cookie/brookie type of thing with gelato on top. I died and went to heaven). We stayed in the restaurant just chatting with the waitstaff for literally four hours. They were so kind, friendly, and genuinely just wanted us to enjoy our dinner to the max. It probably helped that one of my friends spoke Italian. This was one of my favorite, most heart-warming experiences at a restaurant to date. And for a BYOB in Philly, HIGHLY recommend.

Big, and plenty to share. For dinner I had the Tortelloni pasta with Mushrooms and it was delicious. Very much a comfort food because every bite was better than the first. My better half had the Gnocchi with lobster in a tomato cream and that was a close second to my pasta dish because it was equally as delicious. For dessert I had the Tiramisu and without a doubt it was one of the best I've had in Philly! Light, filling without being overwhelming and delicious. He had the Chocolate cake and ate every last bite of it, which is not common, so it must have been good. This place has us extremely impressed, and we are already planning our next date night back.
