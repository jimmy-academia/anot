Ricci's has been in business since 1920 and any business that can not only survive, but flourish after hitting a century mark, has to be doing something right. \\n\\nHoagies ate a Philadelphia staple and definitely a food of the working man. A hoagie allows someone to eat something substantial in a quick an efficient manner. You don't have to worry about a fork and knife to help you in eating it. I heard somewhere that a sandwich was a favorite amongst truckers because they could eat it while driving. I do not know about the authenticity of the story, but it makes sense. But I think what allowed hoagies (or subs, grinders, whatever you want to call them) to survive is that they also taste great.\\n\\nI can say that a hoagie is one of my favorite meals. It is a perfect culmination of bread, meats, cheeses, veggies, vinegar, oil and spices and has been embraced worldwide as a lunch (or donner) favorite. Ricci's do hoagies right and as it continues to get handed down through the generations, I hope that they continue to flourish.\\n\\nSo, after over a hundred years, the community still loves Ricci's and after eating here, you will understand why. My go-to hoagie has always been an Italian and they do their Italian right. It is a substantial meal at a fair price and it is something that you will return to Ricci's again and again for.\\n\\nAs Ricci's enters into their second century, they still produce an outstanding product. With them continuing to do so, I can see them making it another century and beyond.\", 'date': '2022-01-11 14:07:02', 'user': {'name': 'John', 'review_count': 3148, 'yelping_since': '2018-08-03 12:39:48', 'elite': '2019,20,20,2021', 'average_stars': 4.0, 'fans': 87}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'b-pSMWmJdNVh7qnQf3AR4A', 'user_id': 'OExmdhEdcKHQQqXrv6ftTg', 'business_id': 'Bih0eT_lbbCUwKmGYpX0hw', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 3, 'text': \"Fantastic hoagies.

Still til this day not disappointed by anything I had. Most ppl know that If you want a official, authentic South Philly tasting hoagie whether you from Sp or not, this is one of the heavy hitters in the whole city for hoagies. This coming from a dude that's from Southwest, but the two so close it ain't impossible but it's doesn't take away from the fact though.\\n\\n  My hoagies were a Turkey and cheese, and an Italian. The rolls are real soft with no signs of dryness down to the ends. The turkey was very, very fresh most likely also because they slice the meat as soon as you order. Fresh lettuce, juicy pickles, tasty onions, peppers, and creamy flavourful mayonaise. All this made me realize even at my age now and 20yrs later they may never fall off which is legend.\\n\\n  So to anybody curious about where and who in Sp have one of the best hoagies whether you not from the city or even If you are from here but never discovered Ricci's, Come here.

Instead I ordered the soup of the day which was an 8 dollar bowl of bland and uninteresting lentil soup.  For 8 dollars they might want to look into a sausage and lentil option because I can't imagine anyone getting excited for the current version which is not dissimilar to a can of progresso. In addition to the lentil soup we also ordered the stuffed eggplant which was similar to one medium sized square of Eggplant lasagna again nothing to write home about.  The eggplant was over salted but it was almost a pleasant surprise in comparison to underseasoned lentil soup.\\n\\nMain Course\\n\\nMy girlfriend was so excited they had the sweet potato gnocchi on the menu this is one of her favorite dishes.  All I can say is it must have been an off night for the gnocchi because that was easily the worst gnocchi I've ever had.  It was so bland and the texture was so soft, it was kind of like eating gnocchi made from Elmer's glue absolutely terrible I have no idea what everyone is raving about.  I had the Veil Marsala which again was pretty bland.  The meat was nicely cooked but the sauce and pasta left loads to be desired.  \\n\\nDessert was a slice of chocolate ganache with whipped cream it was good but not the most creative dish \\n\\nI'd give this place 2 stars I wouldn't waste my time going back.  Like I said maybe I hold Italian byob's to a higher standard.  When I go out to eat Italian I like food that's at least on par with my own cooking at home and this was a far cry.  I considered the fact that it was New Years eve but as I mentioned before  it wasn't very crowded and no one came in within a half hour of us so the kitchen was far from overwhelmed.\", 'date': '2014-01-06 19:12:13', 'user': {'name': 'Domenic', 'review_count': 5, 'yelping_since': '2012-01-08 18:02:29', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.4, 'fans': 1}}\n[R16] {'review_id': '9XeoX_RMbZCF0-kMUCooQg', 'user_id': '86BxrOGXWq08BLkmwGd_0g', 'business_id': 'gKZuvwFRHcO2Y6XfyWO7lA', 'stars': 1.0, 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Can you say RUDE?!

My brother just bought a condo in the area and made a reservation here last night. No idea how he learned of it and I hadn't read any reviews.

We got 7 different entrees and everyone was happy with their own and others.\\n  \\nThey have a LOT of specials and we probably ordered more of those than from menu.  Salmon puttanesca, sweet potato gnocchi, shrimp-topped tilapia, lasagna bolognese, some veal filled pasta and more. Appetizers of grilled calamari (looked off-putting b/c they were large) were the most delicate we've ever had, grilled tomatoes with toast points, prosciutto and melon all excellent and desserts were exceptional.  Bonnie, our waitress recommended the Italian wedding cake which we almost skipped but thankfully added to the chocolate ganache, tiramisu, chocolate chip cannoli (we got two of these.)   Every one of them was very good but the Italian wedding cake which was more almond/custard than cake may have been the best of all.   \\n\\nThey added gratuity b/c of our large party but we added additional b/c Bonnie's service and the great food definitely called for 20% tip.  Bill was $43 each and again, we ordered specials, etc.  Their pasta entree dishes were $12 - and many entrees were $18-$22 range - unheard of for a byob.

It certainly sounded like what we were hoping to find: a small local place with a unique feel that had good tortellini (it was my daughter's 10th birthday and that's one of her faves).\\n\\nSo I don't know. Maybe it's one of those places that has variable quality, that sometimes has a down night because the cook's girlfriend left him or bad weather made everyone perform poorly. If that's the case, the cook's girlfriend has been really really nice to him and the weather was great yesterday, so Hosteria da Elio really knocked it out of the park for us.\\n\\nThe front room here is very not impressive, but that's not what you should go for. When the weather is nice (and, to re-state my earlier... uh, statement, the weather was fantastically gorgeous last night), the back patio is the epitome of what you want a restaurant's outdoor dining area to be like. Beautiful plants, very serene, cozy, just fantastic. The wine was great, because of course it's BYOB and we had a very nice chardonnay and a cold Sierra Nevada. The service was great, not pushy or fast moving, but well paced for the evening.\\n\\nAs for the food, we started with the eggplant parmesan appetizer as well as a gorgonzola salad. Again, in comparison with some other reviews where people talked about not being able to find the eggplant in their eggplant parmesan, our experience could not have been more different. The eggplant was sliced amazingly thin, lightly breaded, then layered thickly into a two-inch thick chunk of meltingly tender delicious goodness. The best eggplant dish I've ever had except for one spicy eggplant dish I had at a now-defunct Chinese in Santa Cruz, CA.\\n\\nThe tortellini with white sauce was tortellini with white sauce, well executed with bits of prosciutto and really tasty fresh sweet peas, but not anywhere off the range, as it were. Which of course is just what a 10-year-old wants from her tortellini.\\n\\nMy wife had the sweet potato gnocchi, which was, hands down, the best gnocchi I've ever had. I should interject here, I've lived in Florida, San Francisco, and St. Louis, all of which have quality Italian food, and been to New York and Italy as well, so I've had lots of gnocchi, good gnocchi, and my wife's a huge fan. This stuff blew us both away. Absolutely fantastic. It melted in your mouth, no chewiness or elasticity at all, but full of flavor.\\n\\nFor my dinner, I had the veal cannelloni with blush sauce. I seldom eat veal (for the obvious reasons, but it's so tasty that I sometimes break down and have it), so when I do, I really want it to deliver. This cannelloni delivered. And how. I'm used to cannelloni basically being like a meatball wrapped in a crepe. That's OK: when done well, it's a very tasty meatball. But the minced or ground meat has usually solidified into a mostly coherent structure. Not in this one. The meat was very finely minced and mixed with herbs and fell apart once you took a bite of it. The blush sauce gave a nice bit of sweetness and acidity to the dish, but didn't overwhelm the subtle flavor of the filling.\\n\\nThe portions were perfect, with no left-overs to take home, but our bellies well sated. The price was good, mid-range basically. We did not try the cannoli as many suggested, since my daughter wanted to go out for an ice cream cone afterwards and she's the boss.\\n\\nWe probably won't be back in Philadelphia all that often but when we are I would definitely make this a can't-miss place on each trip.\", 'date': '2013-08-05 20:03:48', 'user': {'name': 'Rick', 'review_count': 11, 'yelping_since': '2010-09-19 14:45:36', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.5, 'fans': 0}}\n[R19] {'review_id': 'FehiO_lb13NHSeogGN9y2A', 'user_id': 'zJrrf2WP9xvZAsNl8ssTqQ', 'business_id': 'gKZuvwFRHcO2Y6XfyWO7lA', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Oh I loved this place.

We were able to get reservations for 4 calling just a few days in advance on what was a popular weekend (graduations) for dining out in Philly.  We arrived on time and were seated promptly in the front dining room.  There was a large group celebrating in the room as well, but the service and atmosphere did not suffer.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the printed menu is brief but the list of specials (rattled off by heart from the hostess/waitress) was impressive.  The service was prompt, friendly with Italian character, and generally good.  We did have some minor delays in getting our second bottle of wine opened, and water refills, but the restaurant was very busy.\\n\\nBetween our table-mates, we ordered three appetizers (mussels, grilled portabella mushroom over spinach, and escargot), and four entrees (chicken marsala, lasagna, a calamari pasta, a fourth that I do not recall in detail) followed by tiramisu for dessert.  We shared everything so I feel that I got a pretty good representation of the food.  Everything was good, but sadly nothing was excellent.  The lasagna in particular suffered from too-early plating and perhaps time under a broiler that resulted in solidification of the top cheese layer.\\n\\nIn spite of some imperfections, I would happily go back to Elio's.  The price was great, the portions were reasonable, the service was generally quite good, and the place had a certain casual charm that I enjoyed.

We had a larger group reservation and they took us to their private back room dining room on the second floor. Walking through, I felt like royalty. It had strong lounge-feel vibes and the darker lighting and red decor theme gave me really high expectations. The dining room I believe is traditionally used for meetings because of the TV on the wall and board room-esque seating, but we were happy with the view.\\n\\nWe started the night with cocktails and also ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. This is where the night started to go downhill. The cocktails were not as good as people raved. My Ginger Kiss and my friends Comcastini tasted very watered-down and for lack of better words, cheap. Our stomachs started rumbling and we went right to ordering.\\n\\nI went with the pasta a la norma and got a large platter of antipasto misto for the table for appetizers. The wait time was noticeably long, about 25 minutes before we actually saw some food. I will say, the portions are huge. The pasta was sized like an entree and I was able to give multiple people at the table a good portion to taste. However, it was very simple, something I\\'m sure I could throw together in my own kitchen. The antipasto was also very pretty, but nothing special, just a bunch of meats and pickled veggies on a wooden platter.\\n\\nFor the second course, I got the wild black cod. This course was miserable. I still have no idea what it was, but there was something in the oil that the fish was fried in that gave it a very very undesirable aftertaste. It was similar to the effect of adding too much MSG, but my tongue wasn\\'t tingling. It just felt like I was whiffing wafts of salty, spicy air. I couldn\\'t take more than one bite a minute. The celery root puree was also strangely flavored. Both me and a friend noted it tasted very similar to cup noodle seasoning packets and it just wasn\\'t impressive at all. The presentation was beautiful, but that\\'s it.\\n\\nThe dessert was also not impressive. The flavor of the semifreddo was okay, but it was so frozen that it was hard to cut through and the berries in the middle were rock hard. Definitely not an ideal finish to the meal.\\n\\nAnother thing to note was the music. I noticed it right away as we were ordering drinks and all I could hear was, \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\" The remainder of our night was accompanied with 70\\'s and 80\\'s pop music, which definitely wasn\\'t fitting with the decor. \\n\\nFood was definitely not worth the price.

EVER!!!!!!!\\n\\nMy wife and I have been here two times prior, and it had been good if not great.  Tonight, the food was laughably bad.  If you didn\\'t laugh, you would cry because each course was somehow bad.  While eating my food, I thought to myself \"this food is on par with Chili\\'s or TGIFriday\\'s\".\\n\\nTable 31 reverse engineered restaurant week with the thought process of \"ok each person pays $35, how do we profit from that?\"\\n\\nFor our first courses, we ordered carpaccio and lasagna.  The lasagna was dry as it must have been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour or two.  It was on par with cafeteria lasagna.  As for the carpaccio, it was the coup de grace of the meal.  I would rate carpaccio as my top 10 favorite dishes.  In fact, my wife looked at all of the restaurant week participants and picked Table 31 as a surprise because she knows how much I love carpaccio!  I love the raw red meat, sliced so thinly that you can cut it with a fork.  \\n\\nThe waiter puts the carpaccio in front of me, and at first I thought that they forgot to put the carpaccio on my plate.  I realized that the carpaccio was white and blended into the plate.  It was plated with arugula, parmesan and a vinaigrette.  I am guessing it was pork, but honestly it tasted like turkey lunch meat.  The edge of the slices of meat were brown which meant to me that it was cooked somehow, and it tasted as if it was oven roasted.  The flavors did not blend well at all.  If someone gave me a plate of lunch meat and a salad, I may have preferred that over the carpaccio I had.\\n\\nNext, we ordered the oven roasted chicken, the eggplant parmesan and a side of meatballs.  My wife\\'s chicken was actually pretty good.  My eggplant was piping hot.  I could not touch it for about 5 minutes.  After waiting for a while, I finally took a bite and it burned my mouth a little bit, so much so that it took me another 5 minutes to actually taste eggplant.  The meatballs had way too much garlic.\\n\\nFor the dessert, we had the chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and panna cotta.  The chocolate creme brulee stunk.  We didn\\'t even finish it.  Who doesn\\'t finish chocolate!  My wife actually said \"I mean, this doesn\\'t taste good.  I feel like I am wasting calories by eating this.\"  With the panna cotta, it was ok not great.  The funniest thing about the whole meal was that on the panna cotta, they plated an assortment of fruits that were cut in half.  We got half a blueberry, not a full blueberry but a half a blueberry!  Who does that!  If the restaurant is too damn cheap to splurge on blueberries, then don\\'t plate them!!!!!!

The quality of food varies from decent to well below average to being served cold black coffee. I think they're trying to cut a lot of corners lately and just ride out a previously well-earned reputation of being a nice Philly spot for fine dining, but that Table 31 is long gone and all that remains now is a very transparent attempt at being something they are clearly not.\\n\\nI thought the hostess up front was rather rude, first pointing out that a friend of mine wasn't dressed appropriately but that she would need to check with her manager to see if it was a forgivable offense. Is that the actual restaurant policy? Last I checked, when your business is sitting around completely empty, and five people who were decent enough to make a reservation show up, you seat them with a smile, not a stop sign, regardless of what color shoes or pants they're wearing. Luckily the manager has half a brain and motioned that it was totally cool, but the pretentious hostess still felt the need to educate us on how to dress at a fine dining establishment. Clearly, she needed a way to feel important. Glad we could help.\\n\\nThe food was unfortunately pretty inconsistent. We had some decent appetizers and that was about as far as we got. The entrees were all over the place, some being completely offensive, others being decent, and the rest just showing some laziness in preparation.\\n\\nWe continually had to ask the waitress to come back to help us since she was focused on pandering for her tip at a table of old rich people. \\n\\nLater we were handed serving spoons for eating our desserts, which in retrospect, I wish I hadn't ordered because it was forgettable at best.\\n\\n\\nDefinitely will not come back, and will also mention to others that it's not worth going to.\", 'date': '2012-10-01 00:30:30', 'user': {'name': 'Rizwan', 'review_count': 199, 'yelping_since': '2011-06-18 11:57:49', 'elite': '2011,2012,2013,2014,2015', 'average_stars': 2.93, 'fans': 13}}\n[R22] {'review_id': 'KxAmnJFUGicKnlZ4j1de2w', 'user_id': '5G2IF0VIN3Brl-m45QDXsA', 'business_id': '2BRbu3cBbH2bCgzN3DVc8w', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'No more Insalata Funghi?

It was on a Wednesday in the summer so we were there during Center City Sips, but were passing our time at the inside bar which doesn't do Sips before our dinner reservation in the Table 31 dining room.

I'm not sure what sort of establishment tries to hurry dinner guests along, but we should have left before we were seated as the evening would have gone better for everyone involved if we had never stepped into that dining room.  The waiter was ironically slow and despite our best efforts to eat and get the heck out of there, dinner still took an hour and a half.  Well below his two hour request, but we couldn't get out of there quick enough.  He was condescending throughout our dinner and unattentive and he should not be in a part of the food service industry that requires him to deal with customers. \\n\\nI don't understand what could have have happened to make these folks look down on our group of 30-something professionals, so I can only assume this is how they treat all their customers.

I used the winery name and he told me it was different.  Little did he know I\\'ve actually been to the winery in Napa Valley and I felt pretty confident in what I was ordering.  Anyway, I had mussels for an app in white wine cream sauce that were pretty darn good.  Also had the braised beef short ribs for dinner and they were done well, tender and full of flavor.  Could have done without the dry, crispy garnish.  There was way too much and added very little to the appearance, nothing to the flavor of the dish.  Throughout the night another waitress would stop by and tend to our needs.  Very confusing as to who we were dealing with.

The freshly baked croissant was filled with gooey Nutella and warmed up so the outer later was nice and crisp. \\n\\nI got the Albanian Shakshuka (pictured). It was so comforting, especially on a rainy day like today. The owner came by and offered more fresh bread for this hearty dish.

It was perfectly smokey, filled with generous amounts of diced peppers and topped classically with large cheese shavings and a fried egg. It had really great flavor and was accompanied with toast to soak up that deep tomato sauce that was really so delicious! A winning dish for sure! I enjoyed experiencing another region of the world's take on a plate I enjoy so much in places like Israel and Morocco! \\n\\nThe rest of the fam indulged in breakfast Sammies, creating their own omelets with a variety of fresh ingredients, sweet delicate crepes filled with Nutella, bananas and strawberries, sides of crispy fried potatoes and tender sausage. \\n\\nWe picked up some fresh OJ and Perrier from the self-serve fridge case, along with ordering various simple cafe offerings like teas (a fruity herbal and English Breakfast black) and Americanos.\\n\\n Everything was really well liked by all and the prices were astonishing low! MAJOR points for being able to reserved a table for brunch in the city, too! Unheard of these days and I highly recommend doing so if you'll have a larger party like we did, as the corner place is on the smaller side. \\n\\nThe issue we had here was the wait for our food, which I believe was only for the laborious egg dish from their culture. Next time I would definitely ask for items to be brought out as they're ready and safely assumed I'll be waiting longer when ordering the fregese. You should too, as I noticed others around us who also ordered that dish were waiting. \\n\\nI would definitely hit up this uber casual spot again, keeping in mind the wait for the fergese, but it was pretty memorable and in my opinion, worth it! \\n\\nUnmetered street parking.\", 'date': '2019-03-16 12:22:35', 'user': {'name': 'Sari Marissa', 'review_count': 1403, 'yelping_since': '2009-09-01 22:27:07', 'elite': '2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021', 'average_stars': 4.37, 'fans': 646}}\n[R37] {'review_id': 'IuGb7VsaYDRgZW00nDIulA', 'user_id': '5gl1TD3iMWzXVf_aJ56l_w', 'business_id': 'zDSZ1o-FYC2U7rrBg_kH7w', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 2, 'text': 'Love this place.

The place was already buzzing with activity with most of the tables filled with dinner guests. The service was impeccable with our BYOB wine being uncorked, water glasses filled and a basket of fresh crusty Italian bread with dipping olive oil arriving at our table within minutes of being seated. The menu is extensive with many interesting Italian specialties. Only a seasoned chef can handle so many wonderful dishes on a daily basis! In most eateries a couple of these dishes would be offered only as the dinner special. So, we started with Polipo Fantasia which is grilled octopus with capers, pur\u00e9ed ceci beans and sun dried tomatoes, finished with olive oil and balsamic glaze. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the pur\u00e9ed chick beans was fabulous. Not a humus but a delicious dipping sauce. A second appetizer plate was Calamari Fritti which is traditional fried calamari but these were served in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. A really great mixtures of flavor between the sweet & spicy but adding to the explosion of flavor were the fried calamari. The calamari were crisp, tender and not chewy or greasy! The final appetizer plate was Antipasto which is Chef Tony\\'s selection of an assortment of Italian specialty meats, cheese, and vegetables that included thinly sliced soppressata, salami, prosciutto, provolone, pecorino and mozzarella cheeses, pickled eggplant, roasted peppers, fresh and sundried tomatoes...yep another culinary delight! Some in our party had eaten here before and knew their go to pasta dish was Fettuccine Pugliese that\\'s squid ink fettuccine with shrimp and crab meat, served in a cheese bowl with white wine sauce. I tried Gnocchi Mascarpone con Aragosta which is mascarpone gnocchi saut\u00e9ed with lobster and typically finished with a touch of tomato and cream, but I skipped the tomato and cream and the Chef accommodated my request for an arrabiata sauce. Each gnocchi was stuffed with a dab of mascarpone and cooked to perfection! For my taste the lobster in arrabiata sauce was heaven! All four pasta plates were sparkling clean from our \"scarpetta.\" The dinner was topped off with espressos and orders of strawberry and hazelnut gelatos!

We ordered the caprese salad to start, which was their special of the night. The mozzarella and tomato were flavorless. If you've ever had fresh mozzarella, and I'm talking FRESH, the taste is a creamy melt in your mouth goodness. This was not it. We ordered another special of the night that was even worse than our starter; the veal was gray, slathered with a white gelatinous sauce--a texture that suggested the sauce might have been canned. We also ordered the Antonio pizza, which is topped with prosciutto, arugula, and oil. It was the driest pizza I've ever eaten. Giving them one last shot, we ordered the pistachio cake for dessert. The pistachio cake seemed to be an angel-like cake with cannoli filling. On brand with the rest of our meal, the pistachio cake left more to be desired; it simply lacked flavor.

But the host chatted with me and kept my wine glass full until they arrived. Our waiter, Julio, was so charismatic and provided great recommendations. The Melanzane Involtini (the eggplant appetizer) was absolutely delicious, and we ended up all splitting a dessert (I wish I remembered what it was called - some sort of cookie/brookie type of thing with gelato on top. I died and went to heaven). We stayed in the restaurant just chatting with the waitstaff for literally four hours. They were so kind, friendly, and genuinely just wanted us to enjoy our dinner to the max. It probably helped that one of my friends spoke Italian.

I had been wanting to try this place since I heard about his pizza on One Bite Pizza Reviews. He started making pizza at home for friends and was shipping them out in the mail during Covid. He opened a brick and mortar store in November 2020 but I hadn't gotten Dowtown until today. After snagging a coveted spot on 3rd street, we made our way to the shop. The location is across from Sonny's on Market. The decor and signage is great and features what you came for ......Pizza! Not just any pizza, excellent pizza!\\nAngelo Pizza (Yeah, that is the owner's name) is creating artisan pies that are incredible and as advertised.\\nMeeting Angelo himself, at the register, was a treat. You can tell how passionate he is about what he does in the quality of the product and how personable he is to his customers. We went with two selections...The Angelo Pizza and The Not Pepperoni Pizza. My wife is more of a purist so the Angelo was her pick. It was fantastic! Great blend of cheese, the right amount of sauce and thin, crispy crust. It is a spectacular straight up cheese pizza that will have you eating slice after slice until it is all gone! For my choice, The Not Pepperoni, there was no doubt you would never go back to pepperoni again. It was covered with soppressata and roasted red peppers. Both combine on an already perfect pie to create the right amount of spice with the cheese blend. It really is an epiphany if you have never had sopressata before on your pizza! The dough and it's perfect crust are really the flavor base that have you eating slice after slice.  One other touch with each pizza is a whole, hot cherry pepper. These add a great flavor note to the pizza as well!\\nSorry if I did not take any pizza pictures! We were too busy eating it. \\nDo yourself a favor, go and get this pizza.

I first met Angelo many years ago in the Little Italy district of Baltimore.  My wife and I got to know Angelo and his family very well. They are individuals that believe in community, family, and helping out those less fortunate. We were very excited to see the Portnoy review of Angelo's homemade pizzas, and we were equally excited to see him following his dream.\\n\\nWe bought about 10 frozen pizzas right after the Barstool review and could not have been happier. When we picked them up in Baltimore, Angelo made us a special pie which we shared on the street. It was, and is a great memory. So we were very happy when Angelo got the opportunity to open up his own shop in Philadelphia. Living in Boston, we really looked forward to making the trip to Philly to support our friend.\\n\\nWe finally had an opportunity to try Angelo's Pizza the Saturday before the Super Bowl. Though all the pizzas looked great I had to order the Pauli's, as I was really looking forward to trying the meatballs. We did order the larger size pie which was available just for the weekend. When the pizza arrived at our table, we were blown away by not only how perfectly it was cooked, but also the amazing smell. This truly was a piece of art. I could go into a great detail about all of the individual ingredients, however I will just say that the pizza was extraordinary. Every aspect was spot on and I particularly enjoyed the basil placed underneath the cheese, actually part of the sauce. I did not think Angelo could make a better pizza. It truly was on a par with some of my absolute favorites such as Di Fara, Mozza, Scarr's, and being a Boston guy, Santarpio's. Each one of those has it's own unique style, and The Angelo's Pizza, more than any of them, seems to be a reflection of Angelo himself. It was very evident that the pizza really was developed with a certain person and feeling in mind. It was almost as if each pizza is a personalized letter from Angelo.\\n\\nI talk about each pizza because before we left we ordered three more pizzas to take home.  After careful consideration, we ordered the Noni, the Not Pepperoni, and the Saint Antney's. These were not pizzas with just a bunch of toppings on them, rather they were pizzas developed to send a certain message and reflect something meaningful in Angelo's life. At least that was my take.  I loved each and every one of them and I could not even pick a favorite.\\n\\nKeep in mind, we ordered the regular size pizzas for the ones we took home. I highly recommend sticking with the smaller or regular size pizza as Angelo has fine-tuned the recipe to ensure that the smaller pizza is absolutely optimal.\\n\\nI don't need to go into great details on each of the pizzas, as others clearly have done that. Angelo will not create custom pies but he will remove items from each individual pie off of the original recipe. Take my advice, and have the pizzas as they were intended, they are all absolutely outstanding.\\n\\nThe Noni is a white pie with the sausage and broccoli rabe.  Every pizza is cooked to perfection so there is no need to go into details in that area. However the toppings,  crust, and sauce were just incredible. I absolutely loved this pizza.\\n\\nI am not a big sausage, pepper, and onion guy, so I did not think the Saint Antney's was going to be a real hit with me. Boy was I wrong! The entire pizza is incredibly well crafted, and just the right amount of each ingredient is put on to ensure that no one flavor dominates the pizza. It was truly outstanding.\\n\\nThe Not Pepperoni pizza includes soppressata and red pepper.  This is just simply a step up and elevates the pizza to another level. It is not a simple pepperoni pizza. Again the preparation, quality of the ingredients, and attention to detail adds an element that really cannot be adequately described in words.\\n\\nWe took these three pizzas home to Boston. Over the next three days, my wife and I finished off the three pizzas. We did share one pie with a couple friends who were just blown away by the quality of the pizza and immediately checked how long it would take to drive to Philly to get one themselves.\\n\\nI will be 100% transparent, I have never rooted for someone more or wanted to post a positive review more than I did for Angelo. However, I would never post something on Yelp that was not 100% true. As I stated, I would put this pizza right up there with my all-time favorites. So while I am very happy to write this review, Angelo has certainly earned it and I'm sure that he will continue to build his business and become a major success. If you want to have a pizza that truly reflects the owner and provides a personal experience, I strongly suggest you go to The  Angelo's Pizza. you will not be disappointed.\", 'date': '2021-02-15 03:29:27', 'user': {'name': 'Mark', 'review_count': 158, 'yelping_since': '2010-12-28 16:33:19', 'elite': '2016,2017,2021', 'average_stars': 4.3, 'fans': 2}}\n[R38] {'review_id': 'CrmzXBo-qbgyY4fM5_6dLA', 'user_id': 'M5QAuzQB9ee0ntf9RKkx7Q', 'business_id': 'nmeGoVi_U-bbnojJsi52Aw', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 5, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 2, 'text': \"Recently moved nearby and walked passed here several times before finally caving in to the temptation.

At Angelo, personal pies only, without additions or substitutions (although they will exclude any ingredients if you ask).\\n\\nI opted for The Pauli -- a pie topped with \"real nice\" meatballs. For something so simple, the pizza was also polarizing! The crust was limp in the middle, and the first few bites of each slice sagged depressingly. However, closer to the edges, the crust was surprisingly crisp and tasty. Moreover, the taste of each topping was spot on. The slightly tart sauce and herby meatball transported me back to pasta dinners of my childhood.\\n\\nAt $16 dollars for a 12\" pie (marginally larger than a personal pie), my wallet felt noticeably lighter after my visit.

He showed me his license!) and his new pizza spot over on Market in Old City! We went in for pizza and got so much more....\\n\\nAngelo is a youngin\\' but no stranger to pizza. He grew up slinging pies in his father\\'s  shop in Baltimore. (Yes, he\\'s a Raven\\'s fan, but a secondary Eagles fan so don\\'t crucify him. He even has a lie named \\'The Carson\\'). He came to Philly to attend St Joe\\'s and never left. Recently, during the pandemic, he opened his fun little simple shop. The prime real estate was surprisingly very affordable because of covid.\\n\\nAngelo & I chatted quite a bit. We talked sports, and Portnoy, obviously. He told me where to get the best pizza in Baltimore and we bonded over both of our favorite pizza in the world (besides his), Frank Pepe\\'s in New Haven. He\\'s adorable, knowledgeable of his craft, and super friendly. Felt good to support him. \\n\\nThe traffic was steady on football Sunday and I was afraid because of their \"12 pies, strict no substitutions\" policy it would be insane to grab a pie. You know how all the best places in the city nowadays you have to jump through hoops to secure your pizza, but luckily it wasn\\'t bad. At all! A little wait, but the convo made the time fly. \\n\\nWe ordered a plain that claims to be \"the best f*ckong cheese pizza\" and the \\'Charlie Bananas\\' which \" like Charlie, (a guy from the old neighborhood as Angelo told me) this one is a hit with the ladies\". Banana peppers and sharp provolone...give me! They were both excellent! The peppers packed just the amount of punch and the sharp provolone was such an unexpected twist! The added pepper to box was a sweet touch. The sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and acidity, and although I\\'m not a crust gal, this was thin and very crispy! Yum!! Absolutely delish! \\n\\nAll and all we were very satisfied with our stop and will be back again for sure. \\n\\nWe would definitely recommend grabbing some! \\'The Pauli\\' (meatball) is Angelo\\'s favorite and I definitely want to try the white pie with mushrooms, \\'The Carson\\' next time! \\nThey ship frozen pies too.\\nBest of luck, Ang!
