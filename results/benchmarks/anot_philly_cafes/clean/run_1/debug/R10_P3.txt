Step 0 filled prompt:
Assess how Milkcrate Cafe matches the user's request for a cafe with live music performances. Use actual attributes: Ambience shows hipster and casual, NoiseLevel average, OutdoorSeating True, HasTV False, WiFi free, Alcohol none, Reservations False, Caters True, Delivery True, TakeOut True, GoodForKids True, GoodForMeal brunch and breakfast, PriceRange2 1. There is no attribute indicating live music or events. Therefore the match to the live music requirement is poor. Assign a score from 0 to 10 based on how well it satisfies the live music criterion. Output: <score>

============================================================

Step 1 filled prompt:
Evaluate how well Restaurant 1 (Tria Cafe Rittenhouse) matches a user request for a cafe with live music performances. Score from 0 to 10 based on fit. Use the actual attributes: Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}; OutdoorSeating: True; WiFi: 'free'; Reservations: True; DogsAllowed: True; NoiseLevel: 'average'; Ambience: {'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}; BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': True, 'saturday': True}; RestaurantsDelivery/TakeOut: True; PriceRange2: '3'. Since there is no live music (live: False), the match to the user's primary request is very poor. Provide a final score and a brief justification focused on the absence of live music, noting that other cafe-like and convenient features do not compensate for the lack of live performances. Restaurant 1: Name: Tria Cafe Rittenhouse; Attributes: {...}. Output: 0

============================================================

Step 2 filled prompt:
Evaluate how well Front Street Cafe matches the user's request for a cafe with live music performances. Attributes include Music: {'dj': False} and no explicit live music indicated; BestNights: {'friday': True}, but this does not confirm live performances. Ambience: {'hipster': True, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}, NoiseLevel: 'average', OutdoorSeating: 'True', Alcohol: 'full_bar'. Given the lack of explicit live music, assign a score from 0 (no match) to 10 (perfect match). Output: <score>

============================================================

Step 3 filled prompt:
User request is for a cafe with live music performances. Evaluate Kung Fu Tea for this. Key attributes: LiveMusic attribute not present; HasTV: True; NoiseLevel: loud; Ambience: all false; OutdoorSeating: False; WiFi: free; Alcohol: none; Delivery: True; PriceRange2: 1; WheelchairAccessible: True; GoodForGroups: True. There is no evidence of live music performances or a venue that hosts live music, and the loud noise level may further detract from a suitable live-music cafe experience. Overall fit is poor. Output: 2

Step 4 filled prompt:
Rate Gran Caffe L'Aquila for: I want a cafe with live music performances. Score 0-10.

============================================================

Step 5 filled prompt:
Evaluate how well MilkBoy matches the user's request for a cafe with live music performances. Key attributes: Music {'live': True}, Ambience {'casual': True}, NoiseLevel 'loud', OutdoorSeating True, HasTV True, RestaurantsTakeOut True, Delivery True, WiFi 'no', Alcohol 'full_bar', GoodForGroups True. The user cares primarily about live music; MilkBoy has live music and a casual vibe, plus outdoor seating and group-friendly settings, but the loud noise level and lack of WiFi could detract slightly for a traditional cafe experience. Based on these factors, assign a score from 0 to 10 representing overall fit. Output: 7

============================================================

Step 6 filled prompt:
Rate Thirsty Dice for: I want a cafe with live music performances. Score 0-10.

============================================================

Step 7 filled prompt:
Evaluate how well Steap and Grind matches the request for a cafe with live music performances. Attributes: WiFi='u'free'', OutdoorSeating=True, Alcohol='u'none', NoiseLevel='u'quiet'', Ambience={'casual': True}, HasTV=True, Delivery=True, Reservations=False, PriceRange2='1', DogsAllowed=True, GoodForKids=True. There is no explicit 'LiveMusic' or 'MusicEvents' attribute. The current profile is quiet and casual with no alcohol and TV rather than a dedicated live music venue. Therefore alignment to 'live music performances' is low. Provide a score from 0 to 10. Score: <score>.

============================================================

Step 8 filled prompt:
Rate Elixr Coffee Roasters for: I want a cafe with live music performances. Score 0-10.

Key attributes: Attire casual; TakeOut True; GoodForGroups True; WiFi free; CreditCards True; OutdoorSeating False; Alcohol none; Reservations False; Parking street True; PriceRange2 1; BikeParking True; GoodForKids True; NoiseLevel average; Delivery True; DogsAllowed True. There are no reviews. There is no explicit live music indicator. Therefore, the match to live music performances is weak. No evidence of live performances in data. Score 0-10 based on alignment with the live-music cafe requirement, where 10 is a perfect match. Output the numeric score only as <score>.
