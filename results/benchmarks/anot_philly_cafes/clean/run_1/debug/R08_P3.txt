Restaurant attributes: OutdoorSeating: True; NoiseLevel: average; WiFi: free; Ambience: casual/hipster; GoodForKids: True; Reservations: False; HasTV: False; Alcohol: none; RestaurantsDelivery: True; RestaurantsTakeOut: True; GoodForMeal: brunch and breakfast.

============================================================

Step 1 filled prompt:
You are evaluating Restaurant 1 against the user's request: indoor-only cafe that's dog-friendly for a rainy day. Key attributes: OutdoorSeating=True (not indoor-only), DogsAllowed=True (dog-friendly). For a rainy-day indoor cafe, additional favorable signals are WiFi='free', Reservations=True, No music (Muted ambience). NoiseLevel='average' is acceptable. Rate fit on a 0-10 scale where 10 = perfect indoor-only + dog-friendly + rainy-day suitability; 0 = no fit. Output only the numeric score.

============================================================

Step 2 filled prompt:
Evaluate Front Street Cafe against the user's request for an indoor-only cafe that is dog-friendly for a rainy day. OutdoorSeating = True indicates outdoor seating exists, so the venue is not indoor-only. DogsAllowed = False means it is not dog-friendly. Other relevant attributes: Reservations = True, WiFi = free, CoatCheck = True, NoiseLevel = average, Ambience = casual and classy. Since two critical requirements are not met, assign a low score on a 0-10 scale. Final score: 0. Output: 0

Key attributes: OutdoorSeating = True, DogsAllowed = False, Ambience = casual, NoiseLevel = loud, WiFi = no, HasTV = True, Delivery = True, TakeOut = True, WheelchairAccessible = True. Since the user requires indoor-only and dog-friendly for a rainy day, MilkBoy largely mismatches. Provide a 0-10 score and a brief justification. Output: 1

Step 4 filled prompt:
Evaluate Kung Fu Tea (Restaurant 4) against a rainy-day, indoor-only, dog-friendly cafe requirement. Indoor-only indicator: OutdoorSeating=False. Dog-friendly indicator: DogsAllowed=False (not dog-friendly). Rainy-day suitability favors indoor options; however, this venue has NoiseLevel='loud' which may hinder a cozy rainy-day vibe, and DogsAllowed is False, a major miss. Positive aspects: HasTV=True, WiFi='free', TakeOut=True, RestaurantDelivery=True, casual ambiance, budget-friendly price. Overall fit on a 0-10 scale: provide a brief justification and output the score here: Output: <score>

The user cares about indoor space with dogs on a rainy day; with no outdoor seating and dog-friendly policy, this is a strong match. Provide a score from 0 to 10 and output only the numeric score.
